On its transfer to the London County Council in 1906 the school was renamed Hackney Downs School (formerly the Grocers' Company's School).</p>\\n<h3>Grammar school</h3>\\n<p>As a grammar school, it won an excellent reputation, with alumni including Nobel prize-winning playwright the late Harold Pinter, fellow playwright and actor Steven Berkoff, 1960s tycoon John Bloom, and athletics administrator Sir Arthur Gold. Many famous medical men attended including kidney transplant pioneer Ralph Shackman and pioneering nutritionist John Yudkin. Four current members of the House of Lords are former pupils: (Lord Levy, Baron Peston, Lord Feldman, and Lord Clinton-Davis). It had 600 boys with a sixth-form entry by the early 1970s.</p>\\n<h3>Comprehensive</h3>\\n<p>In September 1974, it became a comprehensive school, and inherited more than its share of the problems of this deprived inner-city borough. It had voted to become comprehensive in 1969. Just before its closure, over 70 percent of the boys spoke English as a second language, half came from households with no-one in employment, and half the intake had reading ages three years below average.</p>\\n<h3>Decline and closure</h3>\\n<p>Things came to a head in the 1990s, when the school made national news by being described by the then Conservative government as the 'worst school in Britain'. Eventually, as a result of direct government pressure, the school was forced to close in 1995.</p>\\n<p>The decision remains controversial to this day, opponents of the closure pointing out that Hackney Downs was singled out for special treatment by the government (presumably <i>pour encourager les autres</i>) and that its academic results were not significantly worse than many other inner-city comprehensives, especially considering the problems it had inherited, including the steady 'decanting' of problem pupils\\u2014who had frequently been expelled from their original schools\\u2014to Hackney Downs.</p>\\n<h3>Later use of the building</h3>\\n<p>The site of the old school is now occupied by Mossbourne Community Academy, founded by Sir Clive Bourne, which opened in 2004.</p>\\n<p>While the school buildings of both the original Grocers' Company's School and Hackney Downs School have been replaced by the new Mossbourne Academy, the Old Boys of Hackney Downs continue their interactions as alumni through The Clove Club, which meets regularly, has its own website, and sponsors a very active email group called <i>The Clove eGroup</i> (on Yahoo), and featured on The Clove Club website.</p>\\n<h3>Histories of the School</h3>\\n<p>An official history of the school, written by the historian Professor Geoffrey Alderman (who was a pupil there 1955-62) was published by the Clove Club in 1972. In 2012 Alderman published an updated history: <i>Hackney Downs 1876-1995: The Life and Death of a School,</i> in which he took the story to the school's demise, using hitherto unpublished material.</p>\\n<h3>Headmasters</h3>\\n<ul><li>John Kemp 1974-89</li>\\n</ul><h2>Notable alumni</h2>\\n<h3>Hackney Downs School (1974-95)</h3>\\n<ul><li>Dalton Grant, high jumper</li>\\n</ul><h3>Boys' grammar school (1906-74)</h3>\\n<ul><li>Geoffrey Alderman, historian</li>\\n<li>Arnold Allen CBE, Chief Executive from 1982-4 of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)</li>\\n<li>Alexander Baron, writer</li>\\n<li>Morris Beckman</li>\\n<li>Steven Berkoff, actor, playwright, director</li>\\n<li>Prof Gerald Bernbaum, Vice-Chancellor from 1993-2001 of London South Bank University, and Professor of Education from 1974-93 at the University of Leicester</li>\\n<li>John Bloom, 1960s tycoon</li>\\n<li>Eric Bristow, World Champion darts player</li>\\n<li>Air Vice-Marshal Reggie Bullen CB GM</li>\\n<li>Sir Stanley Burnton, Lord Justice of Appeal and Fellow of St Edmund Hall, Oxford</li>\\n<li>Sir Michael Caine (Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, Jr.), CBE, actor (attended in 1944-1945, when he was evacuated to King's Lynn during World War II)</li>\\n<li>Roland Camberton, writer</li>\\n<li>Frank Cass, publisher</li>\\n<li>Stanley Clinton Davis, Baron Clinton-Davis, Labour MP from 1970-83 for Hackney Central</li>\\n<li>Ivor Compton, founder of the Hall of Cards chain which later merged with Hallmark Cards</li>\\n<li>Dr Paul Dean CB, Director from 1977-90 of the National Physical Laboratory</li>\\n<li>Prof Cyril Domb, physicist, Professor of Theoretical Physics from 1954-81 at King's College London</li>\\n<li>Maurice Evans (actor)</li>\\n<li>Basil Feldman, Baron Feldman</li>\\n<li>Frederic Sutherland Ferguson, bibliographer</li>\\n<li>Prof Maurice Freedman, Professor of Social Anthropology from 1970-5 at the University of Oxford</li>\\n<li>Abram Games OBE, graphic designer</li>\\n<li>Norman Ginsbury, playwright</li>\\n<li>Sir Arthur Gold CBE, Chairman from 1988-92 of the British Olympic Association</li>\\n<li>Dr Michael Goldstein CBE, Vice-Chancellor from 1992-2004 of Coventry University, and Director from 1987-1992 of Coventry Polytechnic</li>\\n<li>Arnold Goodman, Baron Goodman, Master from 1976-86 of University College, Oxford</li>\\n<li>Prof Douglas Gough, Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics since 1993 at the University of Cambridge, and Director from 1999-2004 of the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge</li>\\n<li>Prof Abraham Guz, Professor of Medicine from 1981-94 at the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School</li>\\n<li>Efraim Halevy, former head of Mossad</li>\\n<li>Prof William Harold Hutt, economist, and Professor of Commerce and Dean of the Faculty of Commerce from 1931-64 at the University of Cape Town</li>\\n<li>Frank Cyril James, Principal and Vice-Chancellor from 1939-62 of McGill University, Canada</li>\\n<li>Brigadier Sam Janikoun OBE</li>\\n<li>Maj-Gen Stanley Joslin CB CBE, Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations from 1959-64 at the Ministry of Power</li>\\n<li>Leon Kossoff, painter</li>\\n<li>Stephen Latner, Managing Director from 1998-9 of Warburg Dillon Read</li>\\n<li>Dr Gerald Levene, dermatologist</li>\\n<li>Michael Levy, Baron Levy</li>\\n<li>John Lewis, Labour MP from 1945-50 for Bolton and from 1950-1 for Bolton West</li>\\n<li>Sir Ben Lockspeiser, cancelled the ground-breaking Miles M.52 supersonic project (its important features later re-incarnated as the Bell X-1), and first President of CERN</li>\\n<li>Dennis Lyons CB, Director from 1965-71 of the Road Research Laboratory</li>\\n<li>Sir Leonard Millis CBE, Director from 1939-74 of the British Waterworks Association</li>\\n<li>Prof Cyril Offord, Professor of Mathematics from 1966-73 at the London School of Economics (LSE)</li>\\n<li>Stamley Orman, Director of Missiles from 1978-81 at the AWRE, and Chief Weapon System Engineer of Polaris from 1981-2</li>\\n<li>Fuller Osborn, (the first) Chief Executive from 1965-78 of Northern Rock Building Society</li>\\n<li>Jerry Pam, Hollywood Agent and Member of the Finance Committee of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences; publicist of Sir Michael Caine</li>\\n<li>Prof Keith Pavitt, of the Science and Technology Policy Research</li>\\n<li>Maurice Peston, Baron Peston of Mile End, English economist, Professor of Economics from 1965-88 at Queen Mary College, and father of Robert Peston</li>\\n<li>Harold Pinter, CBE, CH, and 2005 Nobel Laureate (attended from 1944 to 1948; evacuated to Cornwall during World War II)</li>\\n<li>Lt Col F.

The parish church of St John-at-Hackney was built in 1789, replacing the nearby former 16th-century parish church dedicated to St Augustine (pulled down in 1798). The original tower of that church was retained to hold the bells until the new church could be strengthened; the bells were finally removed to the new St John's in 1854.

In 1894, the district and board were dissolved, with the Hackney vestry taking on its duties within the parish.</p>\\n<p>In 1889 Hackney was included in the new County of London, and in 1900 the vestry was dissolved with the parish becoming the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney. The civil parish was abolished when the borough became part of the London Borough of Hackney in 1965.</p>\\n<p>The boundaries of the civil parish were identical to the ancient parish, and it covered 3,289 acres (13.3\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>).

The parish was divided into eight wards for elections.</p>\\n<p>The London Government Act 1899 replaced the incorporated vestries with borough councils consisting of a mayor, aldermen and councillors. All councillors were to be elected every three years. There was one alderman for every six councillors, and these were elected by the council itself.</p>\\n<p>Boundary commissioners were appointed under the London Government Act 1899 to divide the new boroughs into wards, and to apportion councillors to each ward. It was decided to continue to use the eight vestry wards. The Moderates claimed that Stamford Hill and West Hackney wards were under-represented and should be given nine councillors, with the remaining six wards having six each. In the event, the commissioners apportioned 60 councillors between the eight wards: Clapton Park, Hackney, Homerton and Stamford Hill having nine councillors and Downs, Kingsland, South and West wards having six a piece. With 10 aldermen, the borough council thus had 70 members.</p>\\n<h4>1900\\u20131919</h4>\\n<p>The boundary changes seem to have favoured the Moderates, as at the first elections to the council on 1 November 1900 they won a majority with 37 seats to 18 won by the Liberal Party and Progressives, with 3 independent Conservative and 2 independent councillors also returned. At the next election in 1903 the Progressives won control with 49 seats to 11 Conservatives. Three years later the Conservatives ran under the Municipal Reform label. Municipal Reformers won 18 seats and independents supported by them won 20, giving them a majority over the Progressives with 22 seats. The Progressives regained the council in 1909 with a narrow majority, losing power to the Municipal Reform party again in 1912.</p>\\n<h4>1919\\u20131937</h4>\\n<p>The next elections, postponed until 1919 due to the First World War, were won by the Labour Party: Labour won 32 seats, Municipal Reform 15 and Progressives 13. At the next elections in 1922 a \\\"Progressive Reform\\\" anti-Labour alliance won all seats on the council, and held them at the subsequent polls in 1925. The 1928 election was partly run on party lines: the Municipal Reform party won control with 31 seats, other Anti-Labour candidates won 15, Labour won 12 and Progressives 1. In 1931 Municipal Reformers won all but one seat, which was held by Labour. Labour gained control of the borough council in 1934, and held power for the rest of the borough's existence. In 1934 they won 45 seats to 15 won by Municipal Reformers.</p>\\n<h4>1937\\u20131965</h4>\\n<p>In 1937 the borough's ward boundaries were redrawn: sixteen wards were created (Chatham, Culford, Dalston, Downs, Graham, Leaside, Marsh, Maury, Park, Ridley, Southwold, Springfield, Stamford, Town Hall, Tudor and Wick), each represented by three councillors. To the forty-eight councillors thus elected were added 8 aldermen. Labour won 41 seats in 1937 to Municipal Reform's 7. Local elections were postponed due to the Second World War, and from 1945 the only non-Labour councillors were Communists: 1 was elected in 1945, and 2 in 1949. At the last four elections to the council in 1953, 1956, 1959 and 1962 Labour won all the seats.</p>\\n<h3>Coat of arms</h3>\\n<p>The seal of the Hackney Vestry bore a representation of St Augustine's Tower, the remains of the 13th-century parish church. When the metropolitan borough was formed in 1900, the vestry seal was altered by the addition of the Latin motto <i>Justitia Turris Nostra</i> or <i>Justice is our tower</i>.</p>\\n<p>In January 1924 the borough council resolved to seek a formal grant of armorial bearings from the College of Arms. These were duly made by letters patent dated 31 May 1924. The arms were blazoned as follows:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Per fesse, the chief per pale gules and per fesse Sable and Argent, and the base barry wavy of six Argent and Azure, in the dexter chief a representation of the Hackney Tower proper and in the sinister chief a Maltese Cross per fesse Argent and Gules.<br>\\nCrest: On a Wreath of the Colours a representation of the Hackney Tower Or.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The \\\"Hackney Tower\\\" appeared in the upper portion of the shield, and formed the crest, placed on a helm and mantling. The 1900 motto was also retained. The Maltese Cross represented the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller. These orders successively held the manor of Hackney, until the Reformation. The Templars wore red crosses on white mantles, and the Hospitallers white crosses on black: these were combined in the design. The wavy white and blue bars at the base of the shield represented the River Lea and the many canals crossing the borough.</p>\\n<p>These arms gave much inspiration to the coat of arms of the London Borough of Hackney when the London borough was created in 1965.</p>\\n<h3>Town hall</h3>\\n\\n<p>The borough council was initially based in a \\\"French-Italian\\\" style town hall in Hackney Grove, dating from 1866. The building was extended in 1898. A new Art Deco town hall in Mare Street was begun in 1934, and opened in 1937. It is now the headquarters of the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<p><br clear=\\\"all\\\"></p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>London Government Act 1899</li>\\n<li>Metropolis Management Act 1855</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\\n<ul><li>Robert Donald, ed.

It is protected by Acts of Parliament as a London Square. It is dominated by the Church of St John-at-Hackney built in 1792-97, and St John\\u2019s Gardens. Its made up of listed late Georgian terraces on Clapton Square. More of these terraces can be found on the south side of Sutton Place (once home to Colin Firth) and pairs of early mid-nineteenth-century houses to the north.</p>\\n<p>Clapton Square has a charming village feel, and five-storey houses with their original leaded fanlights above the doors, pilasters and roof cornicing. Their sash windows, ornamental cast-iron balconies, six panelled doors, columns and porches make them easily as impressive as any Grade II listed Georgian property in smarter south-west London, and many have stunning views of the church. Clapton Square, with its ivy-clad frontages, was laid out on Clapton Field in 1816 and is still a pocket of greenery in this busy area. Two sides of the square were demolished in the late 19th century, so today Georgian houses are only on the north and west sides. The Rectory for St Johns was relocated to Clapton Square in 2006.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Square was laid out in 1816 by wealthy citizens such as brokers from the city in the style of West End Georgian squares and terraces. It has central gardens containing a finely restored drinking fountain donated to Hackney residents by Howard Morley Esq.in 1894. The east side of the square was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War but has now been rebuilt in Georgian style by Furlong Homes. Russian revolutionary Vladimir Illyich Lenin used to visit, around 1905, his friend and comrade Theodore Rothstein at a house on the west side. 19th century Jewish writer Grace Aguilar also lived in the Square. To the north-east of the square is Holly Villas in Clapton Passage which is a fine terrace of bay-windowed Victorian villas of 1882.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\u2018On the whole I spent my life more happily at Hackney than I had ever done before\\u2019 wrote Joseph Priestley one of England\\u2019s greatest scientists who lived at a house in the 1790s (demolished in 1880) on the corner of the Passage and Lower Clapton Road. He was hounded out of his house and laboratory in Birmingham by a mob that opposed his support for the French Revolution. He was invited to come to Hackney to take up the post of Unitarian Minister at the Old Gravel Pit Chapel where he had many friends amongst the Hackney Dissenters. A plaque marks the site of his house above the existing corner building in Lower Clapton Road. He emigrated to America in 1794 fearing a repeat of his family\\u2019s persecution.</p>\\n<p>In a cottage behind Priestley\\u2019s house, in the closing years of the 18th century, lived a Huguenot widow called Louisa Perina Courtauld, a designer of gold plate who married Samuel Courtauld (goldsmith). Their son, Samuel Courtauld, founded the Courtauld dynasty of silk and artificial fibre manufacturers and a descendant founded the Courtauld Institute now in Somerset House.</p>\\n\\n<p>Clapton Square is situated near the centre of the London Borough of Hackney, at the junction of the historic north-south thoroughfares of Lower Clapton Road and Mare Street and the east-west route of Dalston Lane and Homerton High Street (Figure 1). The land slopes gently down from the north to the southern portion of the Conservation Area. Most of the Area is situated on the Hackney Gravels geological terrace created by the once wider River Thames. The Conservation Area is split amongst Chatham, Dalston, East Down and Lea Bridge Wards, and has approximately 250 dwellings yielding a population of some 1,000 people.</p>\\n<p>The Conservation Area contains two significant open spaces, Clapton Square and the Churchyard of St. John-at-Hackney, known as St. John's Gardens, an L-shaped green area with good footpaths. The serpentine form of Lower Clapton Road (together with the partly pedestrianised stretch of Mare Street, a busy shopping district) is a distinctive feature of the Area, generating a good sequence of views.</p>\\n\\n<p>The plague in 1665 and the Great Fire of London the following year did a great deal to make country life more appealing to affluent urbanites and this trend continued in the Georgian period. Daniel Defoe, who lived in Stoke Newington, described Hackney in the 1720s as comprising \\\"twelve hamlets\\\" and \\\"having so many rich citizens that it contained nearly a hundred coaches\\\". Important Hackney residents included the Governor of the Bank of England, who lived in Hackney House, Clapton in 1745 and the chief founder of the Honourable East India Company.</p>\\n\\n<p>Georgian streets have a uniformity, due to the regulations of the London Building Act of 1774. Known as the Black Act because of its impositions, it was passed in response to the Great Fire and stipulated amongst other things that houses should be brick, windows recessed and that roofs should be slate and should not overhang. Ironically it is these rigid building regulations so resented at the time that have contributed to the Georgian house being so sought after today.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are significant historic buildings around Clapton Square, ranging from the medieval St Augustine's Tower Hackney the Tudor period Sutton House, the neo-classical Church of St John-at-Hackney, and the High Victorian Round Chapel all of them listed buildings and significant local landmarks.</p>\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Hackney Conservation Zones</li>\\n<li>History, development and archeology of Clapton Square</li>\\n<li>Clapton Square on Hackney's Conservation Zone walk</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":10000,\"dist\":614.9,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":9299024,\"title\":\"Zelda Kahan\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Zelda Kahan</b> (1886 &#8211; 1969) was a British communist.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q8068706\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":0},{\"pageid\":36936830,\"title\":\"Raz Olsher\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Raz Olsher</b> is a London based music producer, song writer and composer.

It comprises the area roughly surrounding, and extending north from Mare Street. It is situated 4 miles (6.4\\u00a0km) north east of Charing Cross. It is also the name of Hackney Central ward, an electoral division for Hackney Council.</p>\\n<p>Hackney Central is the area that once would have been known as <b>Hackney Village</b>. This was a place that flourished from the Tudor period, when principal members of the Court had their houses in the surrounding area, and King Henry VIII of England had a palace (located near the modern Lee Bridge Road roundabout). Hackney Central remained a popular resort for Londoners until the end of the Georgian era, when this suburb of London began to be completely built up. Railways, trams and factories brought an end to Hackney's rural atmosphere during the Victorian era, and its fortunes declined.</p>\\n<p>The industries of nearby Homerton and the Lee Valley have largely disappeared, leaving the NHS and local council as the largest employers. Successive waves of immigrants, both from abroad and within the United Kingdom, make modern Hackney a culturally vibrant part of inner London, with both the benefits and challenges that this brings.</p>\\n<p>Extensive post-war redevelopment has replaced much of the housing stock, but the Georgian housing and Victorian terraces that remain have become popular again.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>In 1727, Daniel Defoe said of the villages of Hackney</p>\\n<h3>Early origins</h3>\\n<p>Central Hackney was largely unchanged by Roman times, with Ermine Street passing to the west. The land was covered with open oak and hazel woodlands, with marshland around the rivers and streams that crossed the area. Hackney lay in the Catevallauni tribal territory.</p>\\n<p>The name Hackney derives from a 5th or 6th century Saxon settlement known as <i>Haca's ey</i> \\u2013 or raised ground in marshland. This was due to the proximity of Hackney Brook, and was probably located on the higher ground around the later St Augustine's Tower. Hackney is not specifically mentioned in the Norman Domesday Book, as at that time it formed a part of the manor of Stepney.</p>\\n<h3>Tudor village</h3>\\n<p>Little remains of early Hackney, except the Tudor St Augustine's Tower, which survives as Hackney's oldest building; and the positively medieval road network. The churchyard, Hackney Brook, and the surrounding villages prevented Hackney's expansion, and by 1605 the village had a lower rateable value than the other divisions of the parish. In Tudor times, there were a number of fine houses along Church Street, but many Tudor courtiers lived in nearby Homerton. On the site of Brooke House college, in Clopton was sited one of Henry VIII's palaces, where his daughter Mary took the Oath of Supremacy. Her guardian was a Bryck Place Homerton resident, Ralph Sadleir who was also Henry's Principal Secretary of State.</p>\\n<p>A further cluster of houses existed in medieval times, where Well Street enters Mare Street. It was on open ground, to the north-east of here that the Loddiges family founded their extensive nursery business in the 18th century.</p>\\n<h3>Georgian period</h3>\\n<p>By 1724, while still consisting of a single street, there is an unbroken line of buildings, except by the churchyard and by the brook, with large gardens behind for the finer houses and inns. The 16th-century church, despite galleries being installed, became too small for the needs of the parish, and parliament was petitioned in 1790 for a modern larger church to be built. This began in 1791 on a field to the north east of the old church, but was bedeviled by builders' bankruptcies and not finally completed until 1812\\u201313 when the tower and porches were added. Further disaster struck in a fire of 1955.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the churchyard stands the tomb of Francis Beaufort, devisor of the Beaufort scale; and that of John Hunter, the second governor of New South Wales. The Loddiges family also has a tomb in the churchyard, and memorials within the church. The parish burial register records the death of <i>Anthony, a poore old negro, aged 105</i> in 1630. This is all that is known of Anthony, but he is the first recorded Black resident of Hackney.</p>\\n\\n<p>The villages of Hackney, Lower Clapton and Homerton remained separated by fields into the 19th century. The fine houses remained, with large gardens behind. Artisans and labourers lived in cottages established in these gardens. There was not the room, or the will, for major rebuilding in the village. By 1800, St Thomas' Square, a Georgian square was laid out on the southern end of Mare Street. By the 20th century, these buildings had declined and were replaced with public housing. An early 18th-century mansion, now the <i>New Landsdown Club</i>, but once the headquarters of Elizabeth Fry's <i>British Ladies' Society for Promoting the Reformation of Female Prisoners</i> remains at 195 Mare Street. It is Grade II* listed, but in poor condition and on the English Heritage register of buildings at risk. In neighbouring Homerton, (to the east of the churchyard) Sutton Place was built by 1806, near to Sutton House.</p>\\n<p>The rebuilding of the Church, on a field to the north of the village altered the course of the road and allowed the establishment of Clapton Square in 1816, in nearby Lower Clapton. Much of the area to the north and east of the churchyard now forms the <i>Clapton Square Conservation Area</i>, designated in 1969.</p>\\n<h3>Victorian Hackney</h3>\\n\\n<p>During the Victorian era, many of the old buildings were swept away and the estates broken up to form streets of terraced housing. The change from rural suburb to firmly urban, was marked by the arrival of the railway in 1850, with a great iron rail bridge crossing Mare Street. Trams began to make their appearance on the streets in the 1870s, and a tram depot opened in 1882 on Bohemia Place.</p>\\n<p>Increased access and the culverting of Hackney Brook in 1859\\u201360, brought about the present road layout. Many older buildings were pulled down to intensify development and to make room for street widening and the railway. In 1802, The Old Town Hall was built on the site of the vestry house, by the tower. This was re-fronted in a <i>baroque</i> style in 1900. In turn, this building was replaced as being too small for the needs of the borough, the political centre moving to the front of today's Town Hall (1937). By the turn of the 20th century, only St Johns Gardens, and Clapton Square, the areas around the 1791 church, remained as public open space.</p>\\n<h2>Governance</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n\\n<p>Hackney Central is the conventional geographical core of Hackney, and in fact, before the 1899 London County Council reorganisation, it was what many would have understood to <i>be</i> Hackney, although the term <i>Hackney Proper</i> was often used to distinguish it from other local settlements such as South Hackney, West Hackney and Hackney Wick.</p>\\n<p>However, in terms of parish boundaries, up until 1835 the areas of <i>Hackney Proper</i>, Homerton, Upper and Lower Clapton, Dalston, De Beauvoir Town, Stamford Hill, and Kingsland all constituted the Parish of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>Since then, the term has been vastly extended to mean, firstly the 1899 Metropolitan Borough, then, after 1965, the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>Hackney Town Hall is about 5 miles (8\\u00a0km) north-east of Charing Cross; and 3.8 miles (6.1\\u00a0km) from the GLA City Hall near Tower Bridge.</p>\\n<h2>Landmarks</h2>\\n\\n<p>South of Hackney Central railway station Mare Street slices through Hackney's 'cultural quarter' of Town Hall Square. Its north side is dominated by Frank Matcham's Grade II* listed 1901 Hackney Empire music hall, on whose stage appeared Charles Chaplin and Marie Lloyd \\u2013 who lived in nearby Graham Road. On the west side of Town Hall Square is the 1934-7 Grade II Hackney Town Hall in Portland Stone, fronted by an open space created when its predecessor, the Hackney Vestry Hall of 1860 was demolished. A new town hall complex is being constructed behind the existing building. Opposite on the East side, is the 2001 refurbishment of the Central Library and Methodist Hall, combined to form the Ocean Music Venue.</p>\\n\\n<p>.</p>\\n<p>The square is completed by the 2002 Learning and Technology Centre. This houses the new Hackney Central Library, the Hackney Archive, the local museum and the offices of the Hackney Learning Trust.</p>\\n<p>The Clowns' archive and museum used to be housed behind the Town Hall. It relocated to the All Saints Centre, Haggerston around 2005; but the exhibition has since moved out of the borough to Wookey Hole.</p>\\n<p>North of the railway bridge, Mare Street continues as The Narroway (originally known as Church Street). By St Augustine's Tower, a Grade I landmark, is the 'Old Town Hall' built to serve the Parish of Hackney in 1802. It is now a betting shop. To the east are St Johns' Church Gardens. In 2009, they were awarded Heritage Green Flag status. Within the gardens stands the Church of St John-at-Hackney (built 1792).</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n\\n<p>The area is 2 miles (3.2\\u00a0km) north-east of the City of London with frequent trains from Hackney Downs railway station to Liverpool Street. Hackney Central railway station is a part of London Overground with westbound trains to Richmond, via Dalston Kingsland railway station and eastbound trains to Stratford, via Homerton railway station.</p>\\n<p>The existing connection to the Victoria line at Highbury and Islington tube station and Stratford railway station will be supplemented by a link to the extended East London line at Dalston.</p>\\n<p>The nearest London Overground station is <i>Hackney Central</i>.</p>\\n<h2>Economy</h2>\\n<p>The Narrow Way (<i>Church Street</i>) remains a busy shopping area, and there is a large Tesco supermarket in nearby Morning Lane (<i>Money Lane</i>). This international store group was founded in Hackney, from a market stall in Well Street market in 1919. A planning application for a multi-storey shopping centre (with parking beneath, and housing above) on the Hackney Tesco site was refused permission in 2010, and the future of the site remains uncertain. A former Burberry factory building is also located off Morning Lane, with a 'factory outlet' that is considered to be Hackney's most visited tourist attraction. This site is currently being redeveloped, in two phases, that will see the retention of the showroom, but add housing above.</p>\\n<p>The primary local employers are the council and the NHS at Homerton University Hospital; there are also two London Transport garages, one at the foot of the Narroway, and another about 1 mile south at Ash Grove. Between Ash Grove and London Fields there is a small industrial estate.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>Schools in the area include The Urswick School (formerly known as Hackney Free and Parochial Church of England Secondary School).

It is situated 3.5 miles (5.6\\u00a0km) northeast of Charing Cross. The area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London. Its historical borders are Kingsland Road and Kingsland High Street in the west, London Fields in the east, Downs Park Road in the north and the Shoreditch parish boundary in the south. Its main shopping street, Kingsland High Street, follows the route of the Roman Ermine Street, and has the road number A10. Modern Dalston is often seen as the area surrounding both sides of Kingsland High Street, even though some of the west side is within the London Borough of Islington.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The name Dalston is thought to have derived from <i>Deorlaf's tun</i> (farm) in much the same way as nearby Hoxton was named after the farm of 'Hoch'.</p>\\n<p>The village was one of four small villages within the Parish of Hackney (along with Newington, Shacklewell, and Kingsland) that were grouped for assessment purposes, together having only as many houses as the village of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>John Rocque's map of 1746 shows the village of Kingsland centred on the crossroads at what is now Dalston Junction and the small village of Dalston further east along Dalston Lane.</p>\\n<p>Around AD 1280 a leper hospital was founded in Dalston by the citizens of London and in AD 1549 it was attached to the chapel of St Bartholomew as an outhouse.</p>\\n<p>During the 18th and 19th centuries the area changed from an agricultural and rural landscape to urban one. By 1849, it was described as <i>a recently increased suburban village, with some handsome old houses</i>, and by 1859 the village had exceeded its neighbour and, with the railways and continuous building, the village of Kingsland disappeared.</p>\\n<h2>Redevelopment</h2>\\n<p>The gentrification of the area has led to a rapid increase in the price of property. The process of change was accelerated by the East London line extension, now part of London Overground. The reopening of Dalston Junction Station on this extension was part of London's successful bid to hold the 2012 Olympics.</p>\\n<h2>Entertainment</h2>\\n\\n<p>Dalston has always been an important transport and shopping centre. It was also, at one time, an important entertainment centre, with four or five cinemas within a radius of a \\u2153 of a mile, and the Dalston Theatre, a former hippodrome and music hall that later became the <i>Four Aces blues club</i> and the <i>Labyrinth nightclub</i>. The Dalston Theatre was demolished in February 2007, despite an active local campaign to save it.</p>\\n\\n<p>Dalston was a hub for 1970s and 1980s pub rock venues but these are largely defunct. However the new Dalston Culture House, the first wing of which has opened on Gillett Square, hosts the Vortex Jazz Club, moved from Stoke Newington in 2005.</p>\\n<h2>Notable people</h2>\\n<ul><li>Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie shared a house on St Mark's Rise in Dalston in the early 1980s</li>\\n<li>Emily Lloyd, actress</li>\\n<li>Sir Charles James Martin, FRS, FRCS, director of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine</li>\\n<li>Alan Spenner- Bass player with The Grease Band and Roxy Music</li>\\n</ul><h2>Shopping</h2>\\n\\n<p>Established in the 1880s, Ridley Road Market is opposite Dalston Kingsland railway station. Fruit and vegetables, some fairly exotic, are available. Halal butchers cluster around the high street end of the market.</p>\\n<p>Ridley Road market is reputedly the basis for the one found in the BBC's <i>EastEnders</i>. The Kingsland Shopping Centre (formerly Dalston Cross) is just south of Ridley Road market. Kingsland Road and the surrounding streets are home to an ever-growing number of trendy boutiques, bars and caf\\u00e9s.</p>\\n<h2>Area profile</h2>\\n\\n<p>Contemporary Dalston is a lively neighbourhood with an ethnically varied population. Architecturally it is a mixture of 18th and 19th century terraced houses and 20th century council estates. It is currently undergoing rapid gentrification, partly because of the redevelopment of the railway station at Dalston Junction and partly due to the revitalisation of large parts of east London in the build-up to the 2012 Olympics. (Hackney was one of the four host boroughs of the Games).</p>\\n<p>Dalston has attracted immigrants for over 100 years; at the turn of the century it was a popular area for newly arrived Jewish people from central Europe. In the fifties and sixties, as the Jewish community became more affluent and moved out, they were replaced by a large Caribbean community, which accounts for the wide choice of Caribbean food available in Ridley Road. As the Caribbean community slowly drifted out of Dalston it then became popular with the Turkish, as well as the Vietnamese. Recent arrivals include Poles, judging by the numbers of Polish delicatessens now appearing and other stores catering to Polish tastes.</p>\\n<p>Fassett Square was the inspiration for the BBC soap <i>EastEnders</i>. Originally, there were plans to film the series there, on location. However, Fassett Square (Albert Square) and Ridley Road Market (Walford Market) were rebuilt on the set in Elstree, near Borehamwood, to have a more controlled filming environment. The idea of Walford stems from Walford Road, and many of the houses on the show use the same exterior design. Coincidentally both Barbara Windsor and Tony Holland, one of the original creators of the show, lived at different times on the street.</p>\\n<p>That is not the only connection with entertainment industry. Around the corner, music hall artist Marie Lloyd (1870\\u20131922) used to reside on Graham Road. The house now has a blue plaque.</p>\\n<p>In April 2009 The Guardian published an article on Dalston claiming that it was the \\\"coolest\\\" place to live in Britain. In the same year however, sculpture park The Towers of Hackney was torn down to give way to new buildings.</p>\\n<h2>Pop-culture references</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>The 2007 film <i>Run Fat Boy Run</i> (directed by David Schwimmer) was filmed in Dalston (St. Mark's Conservation Area).

Dr. Henry Newcome who gave the school its name was noted for Whig political principles, and a large number of future Members of Parliament were educated at Newcome's, which was in the Newcome family for three generations, to 1803. Distinguished pupils included Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, British Prime Minister from 1768-1770, and two Founding Fathers of the United States (Middleton and Nelson). The family descended from Henry Newcome, a prominent nonconformist minister in Manchester. His third son Peter was an Anglican priest, and the father of the Henry Newcome who gave the school its name.</p>\\n<p>The school closed in 1815, and the building was knocked down in 1820. In 1825 the London Orphan Asylum opened on the site. The <i>History of Parliament</i> (1820\\u20131832) comments that, even after its closure, the school could count nine Members of Parliament educated there in the period. It sent 42 pupils to Trinity College, Cambridge.</p>\\n<p>Today the Clapton Girls' Academy is located on the site.</p>\\n<h2>Drama</h2>\\n<p>Newcome's School was noted for a series of dramatic productions. In some case a prologue or epilogue was written specially. The school was one of a group that acted as preparatory schools to Westminster School; the dramatic tradition imitated Westminster's, with the difference that plays were in English (rather than Latin). One of the contributors of prologues was David Garrick. The custom of giving a play every three years was also taken over from the Elizabethan statutes of Westminster School.

London Fields received a Green Flag award in July 2008. A much-used cycle path runs from the <i>Pub on the Park</i> to Broadway Market. London Fields also has a railway station linking it to Hackney Downs and to Liverpool Street in the City. The Pub on the Park is the starting point for the annual Dunwich Dynamo night cycle ride.</p>\\n<p>Every Saturday, a wide variety of producers from around the country take part in the market, selling hot foods, hand-made jewellery, gifts, childrenswear and vintage clothing. Every Sunday, the local London Fields Primary School now hosts the London Fields Farmers' Market and there is a crafts market adjacent to the building next door.</p>\\n<p>A document in Hackney library records a game of cricket to have been played on the park as early as 1802, and the cricket square on London Fields continues to host competitive games throughout the summer (late April\\u00a0\\u2014 mid September). Several teams from the North East London Cricket League regard the park as their home pitch, most notably London Fields CC, based from the Pub on the Park. During the summer the park can be extremely busy with many people combining an afternoon's picnic with watching the cricket. The Turley End of the ground is a popular vantage point for those watching the cricket.</p>\\n<p>The area has been connected with some notable instances of gun crime in recent years.

It is bordered to the west by Hackney Central, to the north by Lower Clapton, in the east by Hackney Wick, Leyton and by South Hackney to the south.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>Origins</h3>\\n<p>Archaeological excavations at Link Street exposed a building dating to the 11th or 12th century suggesting that Homerton existed before it was first recorded in 1343. The hamlet of Homerton (Humberton or Hummerton, named for the farm of a woman named Hunburh) developed for about a half-mile along the road on the north side of the now buried and lost Hackney Brook, within the vale formed by the brook. This led from the hamlet of Clopton, passing near the church of St Augustine at Hackney, then across the marshes and the crossing points of both the River Lea, and its tributary, Hackney Brook. By 1605 Homerton was the most populous part of the Parish of Hackney, becoming a separate parish in 1846.</p>\\n<h3>Medieval Homerton</h3>\\n<p>In medieval times, Homerton, like much of Hackney, was predominantly rural and arable crops were grown, together with fruit and vegetables for the City of London markets. The majority of land was given over to pasture for sheep and cattle, and milk and cheese was also supplied to the City. Small kitchen gardens ran at the back of the houses along the road, with large fields behind. Domestic brewing was common (there are records of brewing performed at Sutton House and the Tan House). Many unsavoury activities (banned in the City) were also undertaken, such as tanning and fulling - the cleaning of felt cloth using urine.</p>\\n<h3>Tudor wealth</h3>\\n\\n<p>Homerton became a desirable suburb of London in the Tudor period, with many estates and grand houses being formed from the former Templar lands (Knights Templar of St. John of Jerusalem). The village was divided between Upper and Lower Homerton, with the later extending towards the marshes and the house at Hackney Wick. Upper Homerton was divided from the village of Hackney by the width of the rectory manor's Church Field, and a path led to the churchyard. In 1538, this estate, including other fields lying along the brook, passed to the Tudor diplomat Sir Ralph Sadler. Around 1560 part of this estate came into the ownership of Thomas Sutton, a resident of the Tan House (adjacent to Sutton House). This land formed part of his endowment of the Hospital of King James in Charterhouse, who continued to own the property until the 20th century, building Sutton Place between 1790 and 1806.</p>\\n<h3>The marshes</h3>\\n\\n<p>Marsh Road, from Homerton High Street, led to, and across the marshes, towards the Templar owned water powered corn mill at Temple Mills. Prone to flooding, the marshes were primarily used for grazing. A Roman stone causeway was discovered in the 1770s.</p>\\n<p>By 1795 the former Templar mills were being used for preparing lead. Sheets of lead were placed in clay pots and submerged in urine, then heated by decaying cow dung. The process converted the lead to lead oxide, and it was then finely ground to form a pigment for white, yellow and red lead paint. A new watermill was established on the marshes by Prince Rupert for an improved method of boring guns, however the secret died with him in 1682 and the enterprise collapsed.</p>\\n<h3>Religion and education</h3>\\n\\n<p>In the 18th century the availability of land, large houses and tolerance to dissenters made Homerton a popular place to found institutions. The educational ones were commonly known as Dissenting Academies. The Kings Head Society moved to a large house here in 1768, forming Homerton College for the education of Calvinist ministers with between 12-20 students. Religious education moved to the new University College London in 1826, but Homerton College remained here as a teacher training college until 1896, when it moved to Cambridge, eventually becoming a full college of the University of Cambridge offering nearly all subjects from 2002. Students from Homerton college were principal in forming, in 1881, both the Glynn Cricket Club and Clapton Orient - which became Leyton Orient F.C. on its move to Leyton. The buildings of the College were rebuilt and expanded several times, but eventually lost to bomb damage in World War II.</p>\\n\\n<p>South of the Brook, by Money Lane, the Unitarian Gravel Pit Meeting House was built between 1715-16. This was the result of an acrimonious split in the congregation of the Lower Clapton meeting. Notable nonconformist ministers preached at the Old Gravel Pit. The moral and political philosopher Richard Price, known for his support of the American Revolution, became morning preacher in 1770, while continuing his afternoon sermons at Newington Green Chapel, on the green where he lived. Those who attended his sermons in Homerton included American politicians such as John Adams, who later became the second president of the United States, and his wife Abigail. On the 101st anniversary of the Glorious Revolution, he preached a sermon at Old Jewry meeting house entitled \\\"A Discourse on the Love of our Country\\\", thus igniting a so-called \\\"pamphlet war\\\" known as the Revolution Controversy, furiously debating the issues raised by the French Revolution. Burke's rebuttal \\\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\\" attacked Price, whose friends Thomas Paine and Mary Wollstonecraft leapt into the fray to defend their mentor. The reputation of Price for speaking without fear of the government on these political and philosophical matters drew huge crowds to his sermons, which were published and sold as pamphlets (i.e. publications easily printed and circulated). Another eminent minister was the formidable polymath, Joseph Priestley, discoverer of oxygen. When his support of dissent led to the riots named after him, he fled Birmingham and headed for London; he was appointed minister here in 1793. Today a Blue Plaque marks the site of the Gravel Pit Meeting House in Ram Place and a brown plaque marks the site of the Priestley's house at 113 Lower Clapton Road (on the corner of Clapton Passage). Priestley said of his time here, \\\"On the whole I spent my life more happily at Hackney than I had ever done before\\\". The meeting house is now used as a factory.</p>\\n<h3>Victorian era</h3>\\n<p>A spur connecting the North London Railway at Dalston to Stratford, forming a part of the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway, opened in 1847 for the carriage of coal. This resulted in Hackney Brook being placed in a culvert and the loss of the extensive watercress fields to the south of Homerton High Street. Its later development as a passenger line led to the redevelopment in the 1880s of the medieval core of the village on Homerton High Street with Victorian dwellings and public houses, and speculative building on the lands either side of Homerton High Street. In 1868 Homerton Station opened.</p>\\n<p>By the 1860s, London fell prey to epidemics of fever. The 200 bed Eastern Fever Hospital was founded in September 1870 by the Metropolitan Asylums Board to prevent contagion. There were six wards for typhus, two each for scarlet fever and enteric patients. Two smaller wards were reserved for 'special cases'. The buildings were demolished in 1982 and the site became the core of the modern Homerton University Hospital. This replaced the old Hackney Hospital which (in turn) had been formed from the Hackney Union Workhouse. These buildings are now used by the Hackney Mental Health Trust.</p>\\n<h3>Industry and housing</h3>\\n<p>The coming of the railways and the building of the fever hospital drove many of the wealthier residents away. The tightly packed Victorian streets provided homes for the clerks and employees of the new purpose built factories (like Berger Paints) being built in the area. From 1937 onwards, the London County Council built mass housing, sweeping away the worst of the slums, but also eliminating many older buildings containing shops on Homerton High Street, effectively destroying it as a commercial area. The Lesney die cast model factory was built in the 1940s on the Homerton side of the Lee Navigation, just north of Homerton Road, producing for many years their <i>Matchbox</i> brand. The factory closed in 1990, and was demolished in 2010.</p>\\n<p>The oldest surviving residential building in Hackney is Sutton House on Homerton High Street. It was built in 1535 and is owned and run by the National Trust.</p>\\n<h3>In modern times</h3>\\n\\n<p>1970s glam rock singer Marc Bolan and actor Ray Winstone were born in Hackney Hospital, on Homerton High Street. The hospital, originally built in 1841 as the Hackney Union workhouse, finally closed in 1995, its poor reputation contrasting with that of the new Homerton University Hospital which opened in 1987 on a site nearby. The old hospital has now been refurbished (2006) and reopened to serve the mental health trust.</p>\\n<p>Homerton's links with popular music continued with the arrival of Toerag, an eight track recording studio which uses reclaimed 1960s analogue equipment, where notably the White Stripes' acclaimed 2003 album <i>Elephant</i> was produced. Babyshambles frontman and ex-Libertine, Pete Doherty has reputedly given his address as Homerton  but it has been confirmed that he is receiving treatment as an outpatient at Homerton University Hospital for addiction.</p>\\n\\n<p>Homerton is also home to Chats Palace arts centre, named after the nearby Chatsworth Road. Chats Palace has presented and encouraged a wide variety of music, comedy, theatre, photography, carnival, disability arts, dance and transgressive performance, including Clifford Jarvis, Tom Hunter, Miniscule of Sound, Red Saunders, Asian Dub Foundation and Graeae Theatre Company. It also hosts an array of classes for all abilities and age ranges, and has been an accessible and affordable space for local people to celebrate their important occasions or present their projects. The building itself was originally established as a Carnegie library for the betterment of the people of the East End. The council closed the library in 1977 but the building was reclaimed by members of the local community.</p>\\n<p>Although this has been, in recent years, a rather depressed area of Hackney, itself a poor borough, Homerton's prospects are brightening. The arrival of the Channel Link at nearby Stratford, coupled with the London Summer Olympics, which took place nearby in 2012, may spell a revival in its fortunes.</p>\\n<p>Homerton is served by Homerton University Hospital, an NHS foundation trust hospital.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>Secondary schools located in the area include Cardinal Pole RC School and the City Academy, Hackney.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<p>The nearest London Overground stations are <i>Hackney Central</i> and <i>Homerton</i></p>\\n<h2>References and notes</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>Tudor Hackney (from the National Archives)</li>\\n<li>Hackney 1795 (<i>Hackney</i>, The Environs of London: volume 2: County of Middlesex)</li>\\n<li>Jacobs, Catherine <i>I Want to Go Home</i> (Book Guild Ltd) ISBN 1-85776-925-2 - Growing up in Homerton, a family memoir</li>\\n</ul><h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Chats Palace Arts Centre</li>\\n<li>Homerton University Hospital</li>\\n<li>Sutton House information at the National Trust</li>\\n<li>Toerag Studios</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":1004.1,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":42268409,\"title\":\"Rose Hudson-Wilkin\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Rose Josephine Hudson-Wilkin</b> (born 19 January 1961) is an Anglican vicar in Hackney who also holds the roles of Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, priest vicar at Westminster Abbey and chaplain to the Queen.

While immensely well connected to Central London, including the City of London, the seat generally has moderate incomes rather than high, and a narrow majority of wards had a relatively high ranking when placed in the Index of Multiple Deprivation, compiled in 2000. In line with most of Greater London since 2000 many parts, especially Stamford Hill, Upper Clapton, Lower Clapton have become marginal in terms of local councillors and these districts, with to a lesser extent the eponymous Hackney and Stoke Newington, are in the process of becoming re-gentrified with ongoing increases in land value, proximity to the London 2012 venues and a council that successfully reduced the level of crime by about 30 per cent within a four year period. Demographically, almost 60 per cent of households are singletons and households have a higher than average level of unemployment. Through all this change, under incumbent Diane Abbott, the seat has become a safe seat for Labour. Abbott is the politician who for many years preceded Alan Milburn as Labour's latest events commentator opposite Michael Portillo on the current light-hearted political round-up of events series <i>This Week</i>.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The seat was created in 1950 and has gone through many changes: in January 2006 the boundary moved again, this time to correspond with the local government ward boundaries.</p>\\n<p>Following major electoral reform at the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885, part of the Third Reform Act, the seat of Hackney was divided into two and Hackney North was formed, this time to return only one Member of Parliament, commencing with the 1885 general election.</p>\\n<p>The Stoke Newington constituency was created at the 1918 general election by the division of the Hackney North constituency by the Representation of the People Act, 1918, known generally as Fourth Reform Act; an Act most importantly remembered for the first time extending suffrage to women. The constituency was identical in area to the Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington.</p>\\n<p>Following a decrease in the population the two constituencies were merged by the Representation of the People Act, 1948, retaining David Weitzman as MP and becoming the current constituency in the 1950 general election.</p>\\n<h2>Boundaries</h2>\\n<p><b>1950-1955</b>: The Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington, and the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney wards of Leaside, Maury, Southwold, Springfield and Stamford.</p>\\n<p><b>1955-1974</b>: The Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington, and the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney wards of Northfield, Northwold, Rectory and Springfield.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>The constituency covers the northern part of the London Borough of Hackney.

Its borders are Kingsland Road in the east, Southgate Road to the west, the Regent's Canal in the south and Ball's Pond Road to the north.</p>\\n<p>It shares the northern London postal district of N1 with neighbouring Islington, Barnsbury, Canonbury and Hoxton.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>19th century</h3>\\n<p>Until 1820 the area now covered by De Beauvoir Town was open country with a few grand houses. In 1821, stimulated by the opening of the Regent's Canal the previous year, developer and brick maker William Rhodes (1774-1843), a grandfather of Cecil Rhodes, secured a lease for 150 acres (0.61\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) of land from Peter de Beauvoir. Rhodes planned to build residences for the upper classes in a grid pattern, with four squares on diagonal streets intersecting at an octagon. However, work stopped in 1823 when Rhodes was found to have obtained his lease unfairly and after a court case spanning over 20 years the land reverted to the de Beauvoir family in 1834.</p>\\n<p>The delay in building had meant that Rhodes' clientele had since moved on to the new suburbs of the West End. The scheme was scaled down and of the planned squares only the southeastern was built, as De Beauvoir Square, although the diagonals partly survived in Enfield Road, Stamford Road and Ardleigh Road. Occupied in the 1840s by the newly emerging middle classes, the estate was almost wholly residential except around Kingsland Basin and the south-west corner where a factory was leased from 1823.</p>\\n<h3>20th Century</h3>\\n\\n<p>In 1937, due to its easy access to Kingsland Basin, the southeast corner between Downham Road and Hertford Road was re-zoned for industrial use. Soon after all the area south of Downham Road was included. This distinguished it from the north side of Downham Road, which was already zoned for business and acted as a buffer for the mainly residential streets beyond. In 1938 De Beauvoir Crescent was suggested as another business zone to protect housing to the north.</p>\\n<p>In the early 1960s the northern part of De Beauvoir Town between Buckingham Road and Tottenham Road was rebuilt as the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney's Kingsgate estate. In the late 1960s a larger area west of the canal basin, which contained many small factories, made way for the De Beauvoir Estate. The east side of De Beauvoir Square was also rebuilt as the Lockner Road estate.</p>\\n<p>In 1968 the De Beauvoir Town association was formed. The rest of the square with the area bounded by Englefield Road, Northchurch Road, Southgate Road, Hertford Road, and Stamford Road became a conservation area in 1969. This area was later extended to cover most of De Beauvoir Town; the eastern edge, however, is in the Kingsland conservation area.</p>\\n<h2>Notable residents</h2>\\n<p>Edmund Gosse, the poet, the son of naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, lived in the area.</p>\\n<p>De Beauvoir Town was home to William Lyttle (1931\\u20132010), a retired electrical engineer known as the <i>Mole Man of Hackney</i>, who dug a series of tunnels under his 20-room property on the corner of Mortimer Road and Stamford Road. In 2001, his tunnelling caused an 8\\u00a0ft (2.4\\u00a0m) hole to appear in the pavement on Stamford Road. Reports that the tunnelling had started again in 2006 were confirmed when Hackney Council found a network of tunnels and caverns, some 8\\u00a0m (26\\u00a0ft) deep, spreading up to 20m in every direction from his house.</p>\\n<p>In August 2006, the council obtained a court order banning Lyttle from his property.

ground and greyhound stadium in the Lower Clapton area of London. It was the home ground of Clapton Orient between 1896 and 1930.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The stadium was originally named <b>Whittles Athletic Ground</b> and was mostly used for whippet racing. In 1896 Clapton Orient moved to the site from Pond Land Bridge, after which it became known as <b>Millfields Road</b>. The football club began redeveloping the stadium, with large embankments were built around the pitch using slag from an adjacent power station.</p>\\n<p>Clapton Orient were elected to the Second Division of the Football League in 1905, and the first Football League was played at the ground on 9 September 1905, with Clapton beating Hull City 1\\u20130 in front of 3,000 spectators. In 1906 the first covered spectator facility was provided, when a 2,000-seat grandstand was built. This stand was sold to Wimbledon to use at their Plough Lane ground in 1923, and was replaced by a 3,000-seat stand.</p>\\n<p>In 1927 the Clapton Stadium Syndicate became joint tenants, and major alterations were made to the ground to allow for greyhound racing, costing over \\u00a380,000. An oval track was installed around the football pitch, with covered concrete terracing laid on the three sides away from the main stand. The new layout was designed by Owen Williams, and the ground became London's fourth greyhound track, staging its first meeting on 7 April 1928. In 1928 the track hosted a new race over 400 yards that gained classic status called the Scurry Gold Cup.</p>\\n<p>Clapton set their record League attendance at the ground on 16 March 1929 when 37,615 saw them lose 3\\u20132 to Tottenham Hotspur. However, the club were in financial trouble at the end of the 1920s and were forced to leave the ground, moving to the Lea Bridge Stadium. Their last match at the ground was a 4\\u20131 win over Brighton on 3 May 1930 with 8,763 in attendance.</p>\\n<p>In 1939 the greyhound track underwent improvements and a second restaurant was built.</p>\\n<p>In 1966 the Clapton shareholders contemplated a bid from the GRA which included two training sites with 180 acres and an interest in West Ham Stadium. The deal went ahead in 1967. In 1969 the track was then sold by GRA and the track's demise caused much upset. It eventually closed for the final time on 1 January 1974.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":1615.3,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":19423206,\"title\":\"Peter McDonald (artist)\",\"text\":\"<p>He is represented in the UK by Kate MacGarry and in Japan by Gallery Side 2.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q7175768\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":10982568,\"title\":\"Dr Lakra\",\"text\":\"<p>Dr Lakra is represented by kurimanzutto, Mexico City and Kate MacGarry, London.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Dr_Lakra_in_Los_Angeles.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q4153348\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":13231444,\"title\":\"Goshka Macuga\",\"text\":\"<p>Goshka Macuga is represented by Kate MacGarry (London), R&#252;diger Sch&#246;ttle (Munich) and Andrew Kreps Gallery (New York).</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q5587310\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1}],\"type\":\"landmark\",\"image\":\"\",\"title\":\"Kate MacGarry\",\"lon\":-0.0564,\"wikidata\":\"Q6375617\",\"lat\":51.5345,\"pageid\":18074797,\"ns\":0,\"extract\":\"<p><b>Kate MacGarry</b> is a contemporary art gallery located in London.

All of its publications are designed by \\u00c5b\\u00e4ke.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Politics</h2>\\n<p>Dent-de-Leone were inspired by Factory Records early contracts, so that each artist retains the ownership of their back catalogue. They sell direct to individuals and bookshops bypassing the usual model of selling in bulk to book distributors who often take a large percentage of the cover price. Doing this allows Dent-de-Leone to offer a low retail price for their work, and pay a large proportion to the published artist. All profits are directed into making new books. Dent-de-Leone began as a vanity publishing project, but quickly expanded as other artists and designers contacted the publishers attracted by the avant-garde design and the distribution model. The books are intended to disseminate the ideas and aesthetics of the published artists, designers and writers. The free Typeface WAR is available on the website of Dent-de-Leone. WAR is a typeface which deconstructs all the \\\"official\\\" countries' flags (2006) to allow a random redesign of your own country.</p>\\n<h2>Origin of the name</h2>\\n<p>The name Dent-De-Leone is derived from the dandelion, a common plant often cooked during the <i>Social Pasta</i> events created by Martino Gamper and \\u00c5b\\u00e4ke.

It is 5 miles (8\\u00a0km) north-east of Charing Cross.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Boundaries</h2>\\n<p>In modern terms, <b>Stoke Newington</b> (informally called <b>Stokey</b> by the local residents ) can be roughly defined by the N16 postcode area (though this also includes parts of Stamford Hill and the almost forgotten district of Shacklewell). Its southern boundary with Dalston is quite ill-defined too, but it was once a well-defined administrative unit. In 1899 the Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington was formed out of the greater part of the parish of that name. The resulting boundaries seem rather anomalous now; the entire eastern side of Stoke Newington High Street and beyond, including Stoke Newington Common, were included in the next door Metropolitan Borough of Hackney, but in fact this area was then part of the parish of Hackney \\u2013 not Stoke Newington \\u2013 and much of it would have been regarded as being in Shacklewell at the time. These apparent oddities became moot when in 1965, the Metropolitan Borough became part of the London Borough of Hackney. Immediately to the south of Stoke Newington is Newington Green, also ill-defined, though originally they were two distinct villages separated by a mile of fields.</p>\\n<p>Throughout all these changes, the core of Stoke Newington, centred around Church Street, has retained its own distinct 'London village' character; indeed, Nikolaus Pevsner confessed that he found it hard to see the district as being in London at all.</p>\\n<h2>Open space</h2>\\n\\n<p>For one small district, Stoke Newington is endowed with a generous amount of open space. To its north, there is the extensive West Reservoir, now a non-working facility, but open for leisure and surrounded by greenspace, at the entrance to which is the architecturally bizarre Castle Climbing Centre, once the main Water Board pumping station. It was originally designed, by William Chadwell Mylne, to look like a towering Scottish castle, and is now much-loved in the area.</p>\\n<p>South of these facilities is Clissold Park, an extensive swathe of parkland complete with a small menagerie, aviary and Clissold Mansion, a Grade II listed building, built for Jonathan Hoare, a local Quaker and brother of Samuel Hoare, in the 1790s.</p>\\n<p>Tracking east from here and past the two Church of England parish churches, both called St Mary's [1] (Stoke Newington strangely decided to retain the old one, unusual in a London parish), leads to Abney Park Cemetery, one of the most splendid and enlightened of Victorian London cemeteries. It is now a nature reserve, a role that it was in many ways originally intended for, as it was set up as an arboretum, but Abney Park became scheduled in 2009 as one of Britain's historic park and garden at risk from neglect and decay. Finally, across the high street to the east is the fragmented Stoke Newington Common. This, however, has its charms, largely due to the extensive and diverse programme of tree planting it has enjoyed in recent years.</p>\\n<h2>Reservoirs</h2>\\n<p>From the 16th century onwards, Stoke Newington has played a prominent role in assuring a water supply to sustain London's rapid growth. Hugh Myddleton's New River runs through the area and still makes a contribution to London's water. Although this originally terminated at the New River Head in Finsbury, since 1946 its main flow has ended at Stoke Newington reservoirs, though a slow ornamental trickle flows past the West Reservoir to go underground for a stretch on Green Lanes, reappearing for a time in Clissold Park only to disappear underground again on its way to Canonbury. The river bank, the New River Path, can be walked for some distance to the north through Haringey and on to its source near Hertford, though not all sections are open.</p>\\n\\n<p>Stoke Newington East and West Reservoirs, to the north of Clissold Park, are quite substantial for urban facilities. Stoke Newington Reservoirs were constructed in 1833 to purify the New River water and to act as a water reserve. As mentioned, the West Reservoir is now a leisure facility, offering sailing, canoeing and other water sports, plus Royal Yachting Association- approved sailing courses. On its western edge stands the former filter house, now set out as a visitor centre with a caf\\u00e9; some of the old hydraulic machinery can be viewed in the main hall. The pumping station at the reservoir gates, converted to a climbing centre in 1995 (as mentioned above) was designed in a distinctive castellated style by Robert Billings under the supervision of William Chadwell Mylne and built in 1854\\u201356.</p>\\n<p>Besides the water board facilities and the New River, Clissold Park also contains two large ornamental lakes, a home to many water birds and a population of terrapins. These lakes \\u2013 purportedly the remains of clay pits dug for the bricks used in the building of Clissold House \\u2013 are all that is left to mark the course of the Hackney Brook, one of London's lost rivers, which once flowed from west to east across Stoke Newington on its way to the River Lea. In flood at this point, the brook was known to span 10 metres. The two lakes are not actually fed from the brook, which has long disappeared into the maze of sewers under London, but from the mains supply \\u2013 ultimately the New River.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>Early</h3>\\n\\n<p>Stoke Newington or 'new town in the wood', has been lightly settled for many hundreds of years, close to larger neighbouring Saxon settlements near the River Lea. In the 19th century it was discovered that Stoke Newington Common and Abney Park Cemetery had been part of a Neolithic working area for axe-making, some examples of which can be seen in the Museum of London.</p>\\n<p>Stoke Newington is recorded as part of the Ossulstone hundred in the county of Middlesex in the Domesday Book of 1086. In the 17th century, for administrative purposes the west of Stoke Newington High Street became part of the new Finsbury division and the east part of the Tower division. Both divisions were in 1889 then incorporated into the County of London.</p>\\n<p>In the Middle Ages and Tudor times, it was a very small village a few miles from the city of London, frequently visited by wayfarers as a pit stop before journeying north, Stoke Newington High Street being part of the Cambridge road (A10). At this date the whole manor was owned by St. Paul's Cathedral and yielded a small income, enough to support part of their work. During the 17th century the Cathedral sold the Manor to William Patten, who became the first Lord of the Manor. His initials 'WP' and the motto 'ab alto' can be seen inscribed above the doorway of the old church next to Clissold Park.</p>\\n<h3>18th century</h3>\\n<p>A century later, it passed to Lady Mary Abney who drew up the first detailed maps of field boundaries and began to lay out a manorial parkland behind today's fire station on Church Street, with the aid of her daughters and Dr Isaac Watts.</p>\\n<h3>19th century</h3>\\n<p>During the early 19th century, as London expanded, the Manor of Stoke Newington was 'enfranchised' to be sold in parcels as freehold land for building purposes. Gradually the village became absorbed into the seamless expansion of London. It was no longer a separate village by the mid-to-late 19th century.</p>\\n<p>Being on the outskirts at this time, many expensive and large houses were built to house London's expanding population of <i>nouveau riche</i> whose journey to the commercial heart of the capital was made possible by the birth of the railways and the first omnibuses. The latter were first introduced into central London in the 1820s by George Shillibeer, following his successful trial of the world's first school bus for William Allen and Susannah Corder's novel Quaker school, Newington Academy for Girls. By the mid-nineteenth century, Stoke Newington had \\\"the largest concentration of Quakers in London\\\", including many who had moved up the A10 from Gracechurch Street meeting house in the City. A meeting house was built in Park Street (now Yoakley Road) by the architect William Alderson, who later designed Hanwell Lunatic Asylum.</p>\\n<p>St Mary's Lodge on Lordship Road, the 1843 home of architect and district surveyor John Young, is the last-surviving of several grand detached houses built in the area around that time for well-off members of the new commuter class. Gibson Gardens, an early example of quality tenement buildings erected for the housing of 'the industrious classes', were built off Stoke Newington High Street in 1880 and still stand today.</p>\\n<p>As a late Victorian and Edwardian suburb, Stoke Newington prospered, and continued in relative affluence and civic pride with its own municipal government until changes brought about by the Second World War.</p>\\n<h3>Early 20th century</h3>\\n<p>Between 1935\\u201337, the curved brick and Portland Stone Town Hall was built for the Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington by J. Reginald Truelove.</p>\\n<h3>Second World War</h3>\\n\\n<p>During World War II, much of the area was damaged in the Blitz and many were made homeless, although the level of destruction was much lower than in those areas of East London further south such as Stepney or Shoreditch or even in next-door Hackney. The death toll was also relatively low: almost three-quarters of civilian deaths being due to one tragic incident on 13 October 1940 when a crowded shelter at Coronation Avenue off the high street received a direct hit. The memorial to all the residents of the Borough who died in the air raids, including local Jewish people, can be seen in Abney Park Cemetery. Like Hackney and Tottenham, Stoke Newington avoided most of the later V-weapon attacks, which fell disproportionately on South London; only a total of seven V-1s and two V-2s hit the borough.</p>\\n<p>Most of the historic buildings at the heart of Stoke Newington survived, at least in a repairable state. Two notable exceptions are the classically grand parish church of West Hackney, St James's, on Stoke Newington Road, which dated from 1824, and St Faith's, a Victorian Gothic church by William Burges. Both were so severely damaged, the former in the October 1940 bombing, and the latter by a flying bomb in 1944, that they were entirely demolished. St James's was replaced after the war by a much more modest structure, St Paul's, which is set well back from the street. Traces of the old church's stonework can still be seen facing Stoke Newington Road.</p>\\n<h3>Postwar developments</h3>\\n<p>After the war a substantial amount of residential housing, particularly to the east of modern Stoke Newington, in Hackney borough at the time, had been either destroyed or left in such a bad state that it was seen by the urban planners of that era as better to demolish it. Postwar redevelopment has replaced many of these areas with large estates, some more successful than others. Much of this residential redevelopment was planned by Frederick Gibberd, the designer of Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral.</p>\\n<h4>Political radicalism and terrorism</h4>\\n<p>Ever a home to radicals, Communist Party meetings were held in the Town Hall in the post-war years. And although Stoke Newington became part of the London Borough of Hackney in 1965, it has never quite lost its own identity. Indeed, following the 1960s, it increasingly became home to a number of squatters, artists, bohemians and also political radicals. Famously, the 'Stoke Newington 8' were arrested on 20 August 1971 at 359 Amhurst Road for suspected involvement in The Angry Brigade bombings.</p>\\n\\n<p>The most famous examples of political terrorism by Stoke Newington residents, none originally from the area, are Patrick Hayes, Jan Taylor and Muktar Said Ibrahim. The first two were convicted of two bombings and had substantial links to the huge lorry bombs of the 1990s. Both were arrested, firing at officers in Walford Road and later sentenced to thirty years imprisonment.</p>\\n<p>The third, Muktar Said Ibrahim, was convicted, as the ring leader, on an indictment of conspiracy to murder. He planted a failed bomb on a 26 bus, which misfired later on the Hackney Road on 21 July 2005. Ibrahim used to work at an off-licence on Amhurst Road. In February 2005, police were seeking Ibrahim on an arrest warrant for an outstanding public order offence and sent a letter to his Farleigh Road address saying \\\"Call us, before we call you.\\\" After the attack, Ibrahim was seen on the run in Farleigh Road and was later arrested in Dalgrano Gardens, W10. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of forty years before being considered for release.</p>\\n<h3>21st century</h3>\\n<p>These days, Stoke Newington is a very multicultural area, with large Asian, Irish, Turkish, Jewish and Afro-Caribbean communities. The area continues to be home to many new and emerging communities such as Polish and Somali immigrants.</p>\\n<p>Stoke Newington has undergone major gentrification, as have neighbouring Newington Green, Canonbury and Dalston. Much of the gentrification of the area has been based around Church Street, where there are many independent shops, pubs, bars and cafes.</p>\\n<p>On Saturday mornings, St Paul's churchyard in Stoke Newington High Street hosts an active farmers' market \\u2013 relocated in July/August 2011 from its earlier site in the playground of William Patten Primary school on Church Street. This was the first farmers' market in the UK to have only organic and biodynamic producers.</p>\\n<p>In June 2011 property developer Newmark Properties LLP announced their proposed development for Wilmer Place. This includes a large Sainsburys supermarket, \\\"high quality private and affordable residential apartments\\\" and a 90+ vehicle car park. This development requires the demolition of some of the existing properties in Wilmer Place and 195\\u2013201 Stoke Newington High Street.

It has had strong ties to political radicalism for over 300 years, and is London's oldest Nonconformist place of worship still in use. It was founded in 1708 by English Dissenters, a community of which had been gathering around Newington Green for at least half a century before that date. The church belongs to the umbrella organisation known as the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, and has had an upturn in its fortunes since the turn of the millennium.</p>\\n<p>Its most famous minister was Dr Richard Price, a political radical who is remembered for his role in the Revolution Controversy, a British debate about the French Revolution, but who also did pioneering work in finance and statistics. The most famous member of its congregation was Mary Wollstonecraft, who drew inspiration from Price's sermons in her work, both in arguing for the new French republic and in raising the issue of the rights of women.</p>\\n<p>The building, which faces the north side of the green, was extended in 1860, and was listed in 1953. It lies within the London Borough of Hackney, although the rest of the green is part of the London Borough of Islington.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Background to its creation</h2>\\n<p>After the end of Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth and the Restoration of Charles II, those in England and Wales who were not members of the Church of England found themselves in an uncomfortable position. Several pieces of legislation, known collectively as the Clarendon Code, made their lives difficult. The first restricted public office to Anglicans. The Act of Uniformity the following year was a step too far for many clergymen, and about 2,000 of them left the established church in the Great Ejection of 1662. The third act forbad unauthorised religious meetings of more than five people. The final one prohibited Nonconformist clergymen from living within five miles of a parish from which they had been banned. Where the ministers went, their flocks tended to follow. Some of these restrictions were ameliorated a generation later, with the passing of the Act of Toleration 1689, which guaranteed freedom of worship for certain groups. It allowed Nonconformists (or Dissenters) their own places of worship and their own teachers and preachers, subject to certain oaths of allegiance and to the registering of these locations and leaders, but it perpetuated their existing social and political disabilities, including their exclusion from political office and also from universities (Oxford and Cambridge were the only universities in England and Wales at that time).</p>\\n<p>Roman Catholics were specifically targeted by these acts, and many of them went underground. Some Christians who had hoped for a more Protestant Reformation within the Established Church chose to emigrate, especially to the American colonies, as the Pilgrim Fathers had done in 1620. Others maintained their faith openly, and lived with the restrictions the state placed upon them, moving to areas where they were tolerated. Often they set up educational establishments, known in general as dissenting academies, which were intellectually and morally more rigorous than the universities. One such was at Newington Green, then an agricultural village a few miles from London, but now within Inner London. Unitarianism or Rational Dissent\\u00a0\\u2013 \\\"that intellectual aristocracy in the ranks of Dissent, as historians often characterise it\\\"\\u00a0\\u2013 had an obvious affinity with education, critical enquiry, and challenges to the <i>status quo</i>, and is \\\"one of the roots of modern English Culture\\\". A critical mass of such people, including \\\"dissident intellectuals, pedagogues with reforming ideas and Dissenters\\\" and \\\"the well-to-do edge of radical Protestantism\\\" clustered around Newington Green. Not all of these free-thinkers were Unitarians, such as Quaker John Coakley Lettsome (physician, philanthropist, and abolitionist) or the Anglicans Vicesimus Knox (pacifist and writer) and George Gaskin (minister and long-time secretary of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge), but most had some connections to the chapel on the green.</p>\\n<h2>The building and its religious neighbours</h2>\\n\\n<p>The original 1708 building was financed with \\u00a3300 from goldsmith Edward Harrison, equivalent to about \\u00a342,100 as of 2014. He leased it to the trustees of the congregation, who furnished it with pulpit, pews, and so on, raising the necessary \\u00a396 from about 20\\u00a0subscribers, primarily by hiring or selling pews. It was a \\\"substantial brick building, of nearly square form, with the high, tiled, projecting roof, common at its era\\\", \\\"Historic views show that the original fa\\u00e7ade had a small pediment against a large hipped roof, with a central oval window below.\\\" It was too plain for Wollstonecraft's Anglican tastes, and one of her biographers thought it defiantly stark. This building was substantially extended and improved in the mid-nineteenth century. An internal gallery was built to increase the seating available, and a few years later the roof and apse were renewed, and a \\\"stuccoed frontage\\\" was built, \\\"mirroring the original fa\\u00e7ade with a three-bay front with two round-headed windows, but with added Tuscan pilasters and a large pediment\\\". In the mid-twentieth century, the building was damaged by enemy action. In 1953 its architectural importance was recognised as a Grade II listed building.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Other religious institutions existed nearby. St Matthias, one of London's foremost High Churches, was built a couple of hundred yards away between 1849 and 1853, partly with money from a rich doctor named Robert Brett, who thought that the Dissenting chapels were attracting so many worshippers in part because the Anglican pews were full. Jews fleeing the pogroms of the Russian Empire established a congregation in the area by 1876, and built the Dalston Synagogue in adjoining Poets Road in 1885. This Victorian Gothic building became one of the leading synagogues of London, with Jacob Koussevitzsky as its cantor from 1936. Fronting onto the green itself was the China Inland Mission headquarters (circa 1895), an organisation responsible for 18,000\\u00a0converts to Christianity that had been founded by James Hudson Taylor at the height of the Victorian era. St Matthias still operates as a church; the synagogue was demolished in the 1970s; the missionary building is now international student housing.</p>\\n<p>Newington Green fell within the old parish boundaries of Stoke Newington. Although the latter village, centred on Church Street, was a mile away from the hamlet of the Green, across farmland or along the ancient drovers' road of Green Lanes, the two places had and still have a close connection. From the mid-1640s to the mid-1650s, Stoke Newington's parish church was led by Thomas Manton, \\\"a principal person among the non-conformist ministers\\\",; a staunch and popular defender of Reformed principles, he participated in the Westminster Assembly, acted as chaplain to Oliver Cromwell, and preached before Parliament on several occasions. Another Dissenting meeting house was built in Stoke Newington about 1700, near the house of Mary Abney, who had inherited the manor. Later that century the village became known for its Quaker inhabitants; their meeting house was designed by the architect William Alderson. In 1858 the medieval parish church of St Mary was supplemented by an impressive Victorian Gothic building opposite, by Sir George Gilbert Scott. In addition to the buildings, Stoke Newington was remarkable for its range of social reforms, from its connections to the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade to the foundation of the innovative Newington Academy for Girls.</p>\\n<p>As the NGUC lacks its own cemetery, some of its congregants, such as the poet and banker Samuel Rogers, are buried in St Mary's churchyard. However, as the Church of England normally limits its cemeteries to its members, most of the Newington Green Unitarians opted for Bunhill Fields until the middle of the nineteenth century, and then Abney Park Cemetery thereafter. (Robert Southey called the former the Campo Santo of the Dissenters, but the phrase was used for both.) Wollstonecraft was married and later buried at St Pancras Old Church a few miles away.</p>\\n<h2>Earliest years: to the mid-eighteenth century</h2>\\n<p>Newington Green Unitarian Church has been associated with many historically significant people on both sides of the pulpit, especially but not exclusively in the eighteenth century. Charles Morton (1626\\u20131698), the great educator who ended his career as vice-president of Harvard University, ran an influential Dissenting Academy, \\\"probably on the site of the current Unitarian church\\\". One of his friends, James Ashurst, founded a group that worshipped in private houses licensed for the purpose, and, in time, this small congregation decided to build a proper meeting house. (It is worth mentioning here the early religious evolution of this church. It started as Presbyterian, with views on the Trinity as orthodox as those held by the Church of England. In fact, several of its first ministers chose to conform, i.e. rejoin, the established church: one of these was Richard Biscoe, who gave the Boyle Lectures in the late 1730s. However, NGUC soon acquired ministers who were Arian, that is, who denied the Trinity, although they retained their belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ. Thus was the Unitarian nature of the church created. In the mid-nineteenth century it was described by a local historian as a Socinian Independent meeting house.) The author Daniel Defoe, who attended school at Newington Green, is believed to have attended the church. Isaac Watts, the \\\"Father of English Hymnody\\\", theologian, logician, and educator, was brought up as a non-Conformist, lived from 1736-1748 at Abney Park nearby, and during that period \\\"was known to have adopted decidedly Unitarian opinions\\\", so he too may have attended NGUC. Samuel Wright, son of a nonconformist minister in Nottinghamshire, writer on theological issues and \\\"a very eminent divine among the Presbyterians\\\" lived at Newington Green until his death in 1746. Several of the church's ministers were at the same time, or had been, the librarians at the theological collection known as Dr Williams's Library, an establishment still very much alive.</p>\\n<h2>Later eighteenth century: the voices heard round the world</h2>\\n<h3>Richard Price</h3>\\n\\n<p>The minister whose name is still remembered centuries later is Dr Richard Price, a libertarian and republican who cemented the village's \\\"reputation as a centre for radical thinkers and social reformers\\\". He arrived in 1758 with his wife Sarah, and took up residence in No. 54 the Green, in the middle of a terrace even then a hundred years old. (The building still survives as London's oldest brick terrace, dated 1658.) In that house, or the church itself, he was visited by Founding Fathers of the United States such as Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Paine; other American politicians such as John Adams, who later became the second president of the United States, and his wife Abigail; British politicians such as Lord Lyttleton, the Earl of Shelburne, Earl Stanhope (known as \\\"Citizen Stanhope\\\"), and even the Prime Minister William Pitt; philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith; agitators such as prison reformer John Howard, gadfly John Horne Tooke, and husband and wife John and Ann Jebb, who between them campaigned on expansion of the franchise, opposition to the war with America, support for the French Revolution, abolitionism, and an end to legal discrimination against Roman Catholics; writers such as poet and banker Samuel Rogers; and clergyman-mathematician Thomas Bayes, known for Bayes' theorem.</p>\\n<p>Price was fortunate in forming close friendships among his neighbours and congregants. One was Thomas Rogers, father of the above, a merchant turned banker who had married into a long-established Dissenting family and lived at No. 56 the Green. More than once, Price and the elder Rogers rode on horseback to Wales. Another was the Rev. James Burgh, author of <i>The Dignity of Human Nature</i> and <i>Thoughts on Education</i>, who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to Price's sermons. Price, Rogers, and Burgh formed a dining club, eating at each other's houses in rotation. When in 1770 Price became morning preacher at the Gravel Pit Chapel in Homerton, he continued his afternoon sermons at NGUC.</p>\\n\\n<p>And there were many at a distance who acknowledged their debt to Price, such as the Unitarian theologians William Ellery Channing and Theophilus Lindsey, and the formidable polymath and Dissenting clergyman, Joseph Priestley, discoverer of oxygen. When Priestley's support of dissent led to the riots named after him, he fled Birmingham and headed for the sanctuary of Newington Green, where Rogers took him in.</p>\\n<p>The support Price gave to the revolt of the colonies of British North America, arguing that the American Revolution was justified, made his name as a famous or notorious preacher. He rejected traditional Christian notions of original sin and moral punishment, preaching the perfectibility of human nature, and he wrote on theological questions. However, his interests were wide-ranging, and during the decades Price spent as minister of NGUC, he also wrote on finance, economics, probability, and life insurance, being inducted into the Royal Society in recognition of his work. On the 101st anniversary of the Glorious Revolution, he preached a sermon titled \\\"A Discourse on the Love of our Country\\\", thus igniting a so-called \\\"pamphlet war\\\" known as the Revolution Controversy, furiously debating the issues raised by the French Revolution. Burke's rebuttal \\\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\\" attacked Price, whose friends Paine and Wollstonecraft leapt into the fray to defend their mentor. The reputation of Price for speaking without fear of the government on these political and philosophical matters drew huge crowds to the church, and were published and sold as pamphlets (i.e. publications easily printed and circulated).</p>\\n<h3>Mary Wollstonecraft</h3>\\n\\n<p>Arguably the congregant Price most influenced was the early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who moved her fledgling school for girls from Islington to the Green in 1784, with the help of a \\\"fairy godmother\\\" whose good auspices found her a house to rent and twenty students to fill it. Her patron \\u2014 or matron \\u2014 was the well-off Mrs Burgh, widow of the educationalist, who treated her almost as a daughter. The new arrival attended services at NGUC: she was a lifelong Anglican, but, in keeping with the church's and Price's ethos of logical enquiry and individual conscience, believers of all kinds were welcomed without any expectation of conversion. The approach of these Rational Dissenters appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women, and in her hour of need proved kinder to her than her own family. She, an unmarried woman making her own way in the world, was marginal to the dominant society in just the same way that the Dissenters were.</p>\\n<p>Wollstonecraft was then a young schoolmistress, as yet unpublished, but Price saw something in her worth fostering, and became a friend and mentor. Through the minister (and through the young Anglican John Hewlett, who also introduced her to the eminent lexicographer Samuel Johnson), she met the great humanitarian and radical publisher Joseph Johnson, who was to guide her career and serve as a father figure. Through him, with a title alluding to the husband of her other benefactor, she published <i>Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</i> (subtitled: <i>with reflections on female conduct, in the more important duties of life</i>). The ideas Wollstonecraft ingested from the sermons at NGUC pushed her towards a political awakening. A couple of years after she had had to leave Newington Green, these seeds germinated into <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Men</i>, a response to Burke's denunciation of the French Revolution and attack on Price. In 1792 she published the work for which she is best remembered, <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>, in the spirit of rationalism extending Price's arguments about equality to women: Her biographer Claire Tomalin argues that just as the Dissenters were \\\"excluded as a class from education and civil rights by a lazy-minded majority\\\", so too were women, and the \\\"character defects of both groups\\\" could be attributed to this discrimination.</p>\\n<h3>Joseph Towers</h3>\\n\\n<p>It would have been hard for anyone to step into the shoes of Dr Price, but the minister from 1778 to his death in 1799 was a remarkable character in his own right. Joseph Towers was born in about 1738, the son of a poor bookseller, and was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Goadby of Sherborne. Lacking formal education, he read all he could and educated himself, eventually writing learned works such as <i>Criminal Libel and the Duty of Juries</i>, and being awarded a Doctor of Law degree by Edinburgh University. Towers assisted fellow minister Andrew Kippis in developing the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>, a forerunner of the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>. He was secretary of the highly respectable Society for Constitutional Information, which lobbied for political liberties, but it was suppressed by the authorities, who lived in fear of the Reign of Terror crossing the Channel. Towers was put under arrest until the Archbishop of Canterbury intervened on his behalf.</p>\\n<h2>Early nineteenth century: The Barbaulds</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1808, Rochemont Barbauld was appointed minister, first as the morning preacher. His wife, Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743\\u20131825), was a prolific writer, admired by Samuel Johnson and William Wordsworth. She enjoyed a long friendship with Joseph Priestley and William Enfield, starting from their years together at the Warrington Academy in the 1760s, where her father John Aikin was tutor. She wrote poems (including a tribute to Priestley), hymns, children's literature, and political and religious tracts. She was an abolitionist, addressing one of her works to William Wilberforce. 1793 saw her contribution to the Pamphlet War, \\\"Sins of the Government, Sins of the Nation\\\". Two years later she wrote <i>The Rights of Women</i>, but this was not published until her death thirty years later.</p>\\n<p>Rochemont eventually went violently insane, attacked his wife, and committed suicide by drowning himself in the New River that runs through Islington. Anna remained a member of the congregation until her death and is commemorated in the church with a plaque which praises her work for \\\"the Cause of Humanity, Peace, and Justice, [and] of Civil and Religious Liberty\\\". Her brother Dr John Aikin lived nearby, and together they co-authored books such as <i>Evenings at Home</i>. As he had been a Unitarian minister in his youth, it is likely that he worshipped at NGUC, with his son Arthur, a prominent scientist, and his daughter Lucy, a biographer. They lived in a house previously occupied by Adam Anderson, clerk to the South Sea Company.</p>\\n<h2>Early nineteenth century: legal acceptance</h2>\\n<p>Thomas Rees took over after Barbauld's death. He was a leading authority of the history of Unitarianism, and made connections with the Unitarian Church of Transylvania. In 1813 two things occurred, key to the understanding of the development of the church: Parliament passed the Doctrine of the Trinity Act, and Rees was succeeded by James Gilchrist, who remained for 15 years. (His son Alexander wrote the standard biography of poet and artist William Blake.) The larger public event meant that the civil and religious liberties that Dissenters had been fighting for were won, the battle of a century and a half was over. The more particular event sowed its own seeds of destruction, as Gilchrist gradually changed his opinions and eventually wrote a pamphlet called \\\"Unitarianism Abandoned\\\", which infuriated his very Unitarian congregation. For a long time he refused to resign, but in the end he was forced out, and the church built a safeguard against such a future occurrence by holding annual elections for the minister. NGUC then entered a very low ebb, with at one point as few as nine subscribers and a rapid turnover of ministers. The causes it had agitated for had been successful, and the church looked backwards with pride, but saw little to look forward to. Energy drained away. \\\"Legal recognition did not prosper the cause of the church, however, which at this time began to decline.\\\"</p>\\n<h2>Mid-nineteenth century: social challenges</h2>\\n<p>\\\"New causes and fresh ideals were needed to revitalise the church, and, fortunately, they were forthcoming.\\\" The nature of Newington Green had changed\\u2014the fresh bucolic village had been swallowed up by London's relentless growth, and had become a \\\"thriving and expanding suburb\\\". With this growth of prosperity also came a tide of poverty, and this was to prove the mission for the Victorian era. A hundred years before, the ethos had been one of almost Puritan self-reliance, but now the Dickensian poverty, evident in cholera epidemics and rampant malnutrition, made social responsibility an urgent necessity. The minister who guided the first 25 years of this (1839\\u201364) was Thomas Cromwell, FSA (1792\\u20131870). (Like many Anglican vicars, one of his hobbies was local history.)</p>\\n<p>A charity school for 14 girls and a monitorial Sunday school for 150 children had been set up in the vicinity by Dissenters in 1790 and 1808 respectively, but these efforts were augmented in the middle of the century. In 1840, a Sunday school was set up for poor children, and soon thereafter a Domestic Mission Society, to visit the poor in their homes. A library and a savings club emphasised self-help. A regular day school ran from 1860 for ten years, until primary education became the responsibility of the state with the passing of the Elementary Education Act 1870.</p>\\n<p>One of the first actions of Cromwell's tenure, in terms of changing the church services, was to introduce the hymnbook of James Martineau. Samuel Sharpe, named after his uncle, the poet Samuel Rogers, came to Newington Green in 1828, and maintained his connection for 30 years, sometimes as treasurer. He was an erudite and generous man, and in 1870 he was elected Chairman of the British and Foreign Unitarian Society. Andrew Pritchard (1804\\u20131882) was treasurer of NGUC 1850-73, during which time donations doubled. He was a microscope and slide maker who made significant improvements to microscopy and studied microscopic organisms; he was a friend of Michael Faraday and for him, science and religion were one. He led the Newington Green Conversation Society, membership restricted to 16, a successor to the Mutual Instruction Society. The \\\"small but energetic community\\\" continued to campaign on the larger political stage, presenting petitions to Parliament on subjects touching religious matters, such as the Dissenting Chapels Bill (made law as Nonconformists Chapels Act 1844), the removal of civil disabilities from the Jews (1847), permission for Dissenters to attend Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and the revision of the King James Bible. Religious freedom and self-improvement were their watchwords.</p>\\n<h2>Later nineteenth century: towards the high water</h2>\\n<p>NGUC thrived during the last decades of the nineteenth century, and its congregation grew to 80\\u00a0subscribers. The London Sunday School Society recognised the one at NGUC as the best in its class, educating up to 200\\u00a0children and necessitating the construction in 1887 of the schoolhouse immediately behind the main church building. A range of groups sprung up, ranging from intellectual (a Society for Mutual Theological Study) to recreational (cycling and cricket). Young Men's and Young Women's groups met, as did the Mothers' Meeting, a Provident Society, and teetotalism (abstinence from alcohol) support for adults and children. Other issues of concern were education, social reform, and women's suffrage.</p>\\n<p>Sister and brother Marian and Ion Pritchard continued the work of their father. The cause of liberal religion in general, and the development of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, were overarching themes. Marian in particular is described as an unsung heroine, and \\\"one of the leaders of modern Unitarianism\\\". She set up Oxford Summer Schools for the training of Sunday School teachers, and Winifred House Invalid Children's Convalescent Home.</p>\\n<h2>Early twentieth century: wars and crises</h2>\\n<p>Thorncroft, author of the church's semiquincentennial history, <i>Trust in Freedom</i>, concludes that NGUC reached its high-water mark at its bicentenary in 1908. Immediately after this, NGUC suffered a religious schism in miniature, when the incoming minister, Dr F. W. G. Foat, backed the New Theology of Reginald John Campbell and the League of Progressive Thought and Service. This Social Gospel movement was not to the taste of all his congregants, and Foat left for the Richmond Free Christian Church. Then came 1914, and Christian faith all over the world was shaken by the horrors of World War I. Unitarians as a body have never been pacifists, unlike the Quakers, and some fifteen members of the congregation and Sunday School fell during the war. Society as a whole found less solace in religion, perhaps particularly liberal religion, with its message of human dignity ringing hollow beside the great guns. Meanwhile, many of the older people with long family ties to Newington Green simply died. The professional middle class had largely left the area. Numbers in the pews dropped. By 1930 \\\"it was whispered that the church could not survive\\\".</p>\\n<p>Nonetheless, survive it did. One influential supporter was an alderman and councillor in the Borough of Stoke Newington, and in 1938 a new lay pastor and his family breathed new life into the church. Although attendance at services was low, other activities drew in crowds: 100 to the temperance meetings, for example. The outbreak of World War II meant that children were evacuated temporarily from London, so the Sunday Schools and Young People's Leagues ceased for a time. The Sunday services never missed a week, however, even when the building was badly damaged by a landmine blast: they just moved to the schoolhouse. After the war, the ministry focused on building bridges between races and faiths, e.g. with the Jewish community of North London, and was recognised by the World Congress of Faiths, an organisation founded by Francis Younghusband. Services were often attended by local politicians, including the Mayor of Stoke Newington. Leaders for the national Unitarian movement continued to be found within the congregation at Newington Green.</p>\\n<h2>Later twentieth century/early twenty-first century: rejuvenation</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the late twentieth century, faced with declining numbers, Newington Green Unitarian Church developed closer ties with Islington Unitarian Church a couple of km away. They started to share a minister and publicise events together under the name New Unity, while remaining legally distinct entities. The 1969 sale of the (New) Gravel Pit Chapel near the centre of the historic village of Hackney released funding via the Charity Commission for maintenance of the Newington Green chapel.</p>\\n<p>By the turn of the millennium, NGUC's community was reduced in numbers. A small congregation of half a dozen elderly women persisted, and a new burst of energy arrived with the appointment of Cathal (Cal) Courtney, first as student pastor in 2002 and then as minister in July 2004. He came from an Ireland of divided communities; he was characterised as a \\\"radical spirit\\\" who had made a \\\"remarkable spiritual journey\\\", and his weekly sermons soon attracted twenty people. In the tradition of Unitarian social action, he led a silent vigil through the night before the huge march against the Iraq War, \\\"protesting against the US-led incursion with, among others, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists and Jews present\\\" Later made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, during his time at NGUC he wrote <i>Towards Beloved Community</i> and was written about as the Right-On Reverend in <i>The Oldie'</i>s monthly \\\"East of Islington\\\" column.</p>\\n<p>The incumbent is Andrew Pakula, an American who grew up in a Jewish family in New York. His MIT doctorate in biology and master's degree in business led to his first career in biotechnology management and business development, before he undertook ministerial training, completing his studies at Unitarian College, Manchester. He began serving in October 2006, was inducted as full minister in January 2010, and was elected to the executive committee of the British Unitarians. He was described\\u00a0\\u2013 sympathetically\\u00a0\\u2013 in the local press as \\\"controversial\\\" when he did a reverse collection plate, giving his own money away to those attending one sermon.</p>\\n<h3>Richard Price Memorial Lecture</h3>\\n<p>Courtney revived the Richard Price Memorial Lecture, which had last been given in 1981. NGUC now sponsors it annually, to address \\\"a topical or important aspect of liberty, reason and ethics\\\". In September 2003 the first of the new series took place under the auspices of the Stoke Newington Unitarian Conference, where Barbara Taylor, author of <i>Mary Wollstonecraft and the Feminist Imagination</i>, spoke on \\\"Radical Dissent and Women's Rights in Eighteenth-Century Britain\\\". In 2005 Will Self addressed the need to disestablish the Church of England  under the title \\\"Why Religion Needs Satire\\\". The November 2008 lecture took the theme of \\\"Dishonesty\\\": Evan Davis, the economist and BBC presenter, used the platform to argue that \\\"the media industry has a 'misleading ethical code' and tendency to be dishonest\\\". The 2009 lecture, given on 27 January 2010, was given by psychotherapist Susie Orbach, who spoke on the topic \\\"Frankenstein's Bodies Today\\\". The 2010 lecture was given by literary critic Terry Eagleton, who spoke on \\\"The New Atheism and the War on Terror\\\". In 2011 Wendy Savage, a doctor and long-time campaigner for women's reproductive health, spoke on \\\" Patients' Choice and Doctors' Responsibilities\\\".</p>\\n<h3>Stance on gay marriage</h3>\\n<p>In March 2008, Newington Green Unitarian Church became the first religious establishment in Britain to refuse to carry out any weddings at all until all couples have equal marriage rights. Unity Church Islington followed suit a couple of months later. Pakula stated that same-sex couples \\\"are being treated like second-class citizens when they are forbidden to celebrate their unions in a way that heterosexual couples take for granted\\\". The BBC called it a \\\"gay rights church\\\" for its unanimous committee vote suspending full wedding services, although NGUC is not a \\\"gay church\\\" such as the Metropolitan Community Church, and it still conducts ceremonial blessings of relationships, straight and gay. The church's decision was in response to the case brought by the Christian Institute, backing the claim of Lillian Ladele, a registrar employed by Islington London Borough Council who wished to be exempted from having to perform civil partnership ceremonies on the grounds of her religion. The move was praised by Rev. Richard Kirker, chairman of the national Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement. \\\"This is the first church I\\u2019ve heard of to have taken this step\\\", he said. \\\"We\\u2019re proud that Islington is striking a blow for human rights.\\\" Following in the steps of his immediate predecessor, who used his inaugural column in the <i>N16 magazine</i> to address the international furore around Gene Robinson's election as bishop, Pakula sees homophobia as the real problem, and his congregation did consider challenging the law under the European Convention on Human Rights. Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell called on the church to conduct a gay marriage in defiance of the law.</p>\\n<h3>Tercentenary celebrations</h3>\\n<p>NGUC celebrated its tercentenary in 2008 under the slogan \\\"300 years of dissent\\\", marking this with events such as planting a crab apple tree, organising a picnic in conjunction with the Newington Green Action Group, and hosting a concert of Ottoman classical music. (There is a strong Turkish community in Newington Green and along the nearest section of Green Lanes, an ancient road which starts from the northwest corner of the Green.)</p>\\n<h3>250th anniversary of Wollstonecraft's birth</h3>\\n<p>The following year it commemorated the 250th anniversary of the birth of Mary Wollstonecraft, attaching a large banner to the railings outside the building, proclaiming it the \\\"birthplace of feminism\\\", in a nod to the formative years that she spent worshipping there. NGUC sponsored a series of events, including a return visit and lecture by biographer Barbara Taylor; a panel discussion about women and power, between female politicians Diane Abbott MP, Jean Lambert MEP, and Emily Thornberry MP; an art exhibition titled Mother of Feminism; a concert featuring Carol Grimes and Adey Grummet, to raise money for Stop the Traffik, an anti-trafficking charity; a tombstone tribute at St Pancras Old Church; a birthday cake baked by men; and other activities.</p>\\n<p>Pakula's sermon in honour of the Wollstonecraft anniversary stressed her role as a prophet. This excerpt serves as a flavour of the emphasis given to social action within the church:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Mary Wollstonecraft was a unique individual\\u00a0\\u2013 brilliant and strong. She was one who would not be swept along in stream of the common beliefs and understandings of her time. Hers was a keener sight\\u00a0\\u2013 a vision that saw beyond what most people take for granted. She saw, contrary to the assumptions of her time, that women were the equals of men. Her bold stance\\u00a0\\u2013 a position that proved to be many years ahead of her time\\u00a0\\u2013 was met with broad condemnation. Today, we recognise that Mary Wollstonecraft spoke with the voice of prophesy. We honour her for her courage and for the gifts she has given to future generations of women and men.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>Regular and occasional activities</h3>\\n<p>Sunday services alternate between NGUC and its Islington sister, including special events such as the yearly Flower Communion; twice-monthly poetry readings and weekly meditation sessions are held at Newington Green. It participates in the annual festival of architecture, Open House London. It hosts occasional concerts, such as that given by the London Gallery Quire, which \\\"performs West Gallery Music, the psalmody heard in parish churches and non-conformist chapels during the Georgian period, from about 1720 to 1850\\\", and the Psallite Women's Choir. The congregation was reported to have grown to 70 as of 2009, with 30 at one Sunday service; it is one of the most rapidly growing Unitarian churches in Britain.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\\n<ul><li><i>The Village that Changed the World: A History of Newington Green London N16</i> by Alex Allardyce.

It gives its name to the surrounding area, roughly bounded by Ball's Pond Road to the south, Petherton Road to the west, the southern section of Stoke Newington with Green Lanes, Matthias Road to the north, and Boleyn Road to the east. The Green itself is in N16 and the area is covered by the N16, N1 and N5 postcodes.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Origins</h2>\\n<p>The first record of the area is as 'Neutone' in the Domesday Survey of 1086, when it still formed part of the demesne of St Paul\\u2019s Cathedral. The thirteenth century saw Newton become Newington, whilst the prefix 'Stoke' was added in the area to the north, distinguishing it from Newington Barrow or Newington Berners in Islington. Newington Barrow later became known as Highbury, after the manor house built on a hill.</p>\\n<p>There was probably a medieval settlement, and the prevailing activity was agriculture, growing hay and food for the inhabitants of nearby London. By the 15th century the area had become more prosperous and in 1445 there were a good number of Londoners living in the hamlet. The name Newington Green was first mentioned in 1480. By the 1490s it was fringed by cottages, homesteads and crofts on the three sides in Newington Barrow manor in Islington. The north side was divided between the manors of Stoke Newington and Brownswood in South Hornsey.</p>\\n<h2>Royal visitors and ministers</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the 16th century the area was connected to the court of Henry VIII. The king himself used a house on the south side of the Green as a base for hunting the wild bulls, stags and wild boars that roamed the surrounding forest.</p>\\n<p>In 1523 a resident of the north side of the Green, the future 6th Earl of Northumberland, Henry Percy became engaged to Anne Boleyn. At the time he was page to Cardinal Wolsey. Lord Percy had not sought permission from either his father or the king, causing Wolsey to scold him and his father to refuse the marriage. He later found himself a member of the jury that convicted Anne of adultery. His home, Brook House, stood at the northeast corner of the square. It contained a central courtyard and was decorated with gilded and painted wainscotting. It was later demolished, renamed Bishop's Place, and divided into tenements for the poor.</p>\\n<p>In 1535 Henry VIII's chief minister (i.e. prime minister), Thomas Cromwell, took up residence at Canonbury Tower to the south of the area, from where he organised the Dissolution of the Monasteries and their transfer into royal ownership. (Just a year later Cromwell was accused of treason and executed on spurious evidence.) Other Tower residents included, in the 16th century, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick and afterwards Duke of Northumberland, general, admiral, and politician; in the 17th century, Francis Bacon, the father of the scientific method, at that time the Attorney General, and Sir Thomas Coventry, afterwards Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; in the 18th century, Oliver Goldsmith, the writer.</p>\\n<h2>Samuel Pepys</h2>\\n<p>The famous 17th century diarist Samuel Pepys was sent to the Newington Green and Kingsland area by his mother in order to benefit from the fresh air and open spaces of what was a rural area at that time.</p>\\n<h2>Mildmay</h2>\\n<p>Newington Green's history is marked by several streets in the area taking their name from this period, such as King Henry\\u2019s Walk, Boleyn Road (formerly Ann Boleyn\\u2019s Walk), Wolsey Road and Queen Elizabeth\\u2019s Walk. Many other thoroughfares are named after the Mildmay estate, including Mildmay Park, Mildmay Grove North and Mildmay Grove South. Sir Walter Mildmay was the Chancellor of the Exchequer under Elizabeth I. He was one of the special commissioners in the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, and founded Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1584.</p>\\n<p>His grandson Sir Henry Mildmay served as MP and was Master of the Jewel House for Charles I. Henry was critical of the king's religious policies, supported Parliament during the civil wars and attended the king's trial. After the Restoration Henry was arrested for his part in the regicide, but granted leniency because he had refused to sign the king's death warrant. Instead of the death penalty he was sent to the Tower of London, stripped of his knighthood and his estates and sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\\n<p>Mildmay Mission Hospital was founded in the 1890s, inspired by the work of the Reverend William Pennefather during the cholera epidemic of 1866. It was absorbed into the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, and in the 1980s began pioneering work into the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS, which it continues.</p>\\n<p>Mildmay Park, located on the street of the same name, was a station on the North London Railway. Opened in 1880, it closed in 1934. The station building was demolished in 1987, but remnants of the platforms can still be seen at track level.</p>\\n<h2>Nonconformists and the Dissenting Academies</h2>\\n<p>The area became the home of English Dissenters during the 17th century. Following the religious upheavals after the Restoration, some Protestants chose to remain in England and maintain their faith openly, but they had to live with the restrictions the state placed upon them. They moved to places tolerant of them; often they set up educational establishments, known in general as dissenting academies, which were intellectually and morally more rigorous than the universities. One such place was Newington Green, then still an agricultural village, but conveniently near London.) Oliver Cromwell's family had links there: his great-granddaughter Mary was born at the Green on 11 April 1691.</p>\\n<p>A critical mass of \\\"dissident intellectuals, pedagogues with reforming ideas and Dissenters\\\" and \\\"the well-to-do edge of radical Protestantism\\\" clustered around Newington Green, and other villages nearby such as Stoke Newington and Hackney. Not all of these free-thinkers were Unitarians: other notables include the Quaker physician John Coakley Lettsome and the Anglican pacifist Vicesimus Knox.</p>\\n<p>One such academy was set up on north of the Green, run by Charles Morton. One of the academy's students was Daniel Defoe, the writer, journalist and spy famous for his novel <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. Another pupil was the controversial poet Samuel Wesley, father of John Wesley, the great religious leader. A later schoolmaster was the Rev. James Burgh, author of <i>The Dignity of Human Nature</i> and <i>Thoughts on Education</i>, who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to the church there.</p>\\n<h2>Unitarian Church, Price and Wollstonecraft</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1708 the Newington Green Unitarian Church was built on the north, Hackney side of the Green. That congregation continues today as New Unity. The minister whose name is still remembered centuries later is Dr Richard Price, a libertarian and republican who cemented the village's <i>\\\"reputation as a centre for radical thinkers and social reformers\\\"</i>. He arrived in 1758 with his wife Sarah, and took up residence in No. 54 the Green, in the middle of a terrace even then a hundred years old (The building still survives as London's oldest brick terrace, dated 1658). A large number of important politicians, thinkers, reformers, and writers visited him at Newington Green, including Founding Fathers of the United States, British politicians such as Lord Lyttleton, the Earl of Shelburne, Earl Stanhope (known as <i>\\\"Citizen Stanhope\\\"</i>), and even the Prime Minister William Pitt\\u00a0; philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith; agitators such as prison reformer John Howard, gadfly John Horne Tooke and husband and wife John and Ann Jebb. Price was fortunate in forming close friendships among his neighbours and congregants. One was Thomas Rogers, father of poet and banker Samuel Rogers, a merchant turned banker who had married into a long-established Dissenting family and lived at No. 56 the Green. Another was the Rev. James Burgh, author of <i>The Dignity of Human Nature</i> and <i>Thoughts on Education</i>, who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to Price's sermons. Price, Rogers, and Burgh formed a dining club, eating at each other's houses in rotation. When Joseph Priestley's support of dissent led to the riots named after him, he fled Birmingham and headed for the sanctuary of Newington Green, where Rogers took him in.</p>\\n<p>Arguably the most important resident of the Green was the early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who moved her fledgling school for girls from Islington to Newington Green in 1784, with the help of a fairy godmother. This was Mrs Burgh, widow of the educationalist, who used her influence to find the young schoolmistress a house to rent and twenty students to fill it. The flavour of the village and the approach of these Rational Dissenters appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women. The ideas Wollstonecraft ingested from the sermons at NGUC pushed her towards a political awakening. A couple of years after she left Newington Green, these seeds germinated into <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Men</i>, a response to Burke's denunciation of the French Revolution and attack on Price. In 1792 she published the work for which she is best remembered, <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>, in the spirit of rationalism extending Price's arguments about equality to women. Newington Green had made its mark on Mary, and through this founding work of feminist philosophy, on the world.</p>\\n<h2>The New River</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1602 it was proposed that a new river should be constructed to provide London with its first clean, fresh water. Sir Hugh Myddleton, a Welsh goldsmith and philanthropist, was given the responsibility, and in 1609 he built a canal from the Hertfordshire rivers of Chadwell and Amwell, 38 miles to the New River Head Reservoir at Amwell Street in Clerkenwell. Originally open to the air, the aqueduct flowed down the centre of the present day Petherton Road. It was later covered for sanitary reasons.</p>\\n<p>In 1808, Rochemont Barbauld was appointed minister to Newington Green Unitarian Church. His wife, Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743\\u20131825), was a prolific writer, admired by Samuel Johnson and William Wordsworth. She enjoyed a long friendship with Joseph Priestley and William Enfield, starting from their years together at the Warrington Academy in the 1760s, where her father was tutor. She wrote poems (including a tribute to Priestley), hymns, children's literature, and political and religious tracts. She was an abolitionist, addressing one of her works to William Wilberforce. 1793 saw her contribution to the Pamphlet War, <i>\\\"Sins of the Government, Sins of the Nation\\\"</i>. Two years later she wrote <i>The Rights of Women</i>, but this was not published until her death thirty years later. Rochemont eventually went violently insane, attacked his wife and committed suicide by drowning himself in the river.</p>\\n<p>In 1946 the supply was redirected at Stoke Newington and in 1990 the New River was replaced by deep mains. Part of the New River\\u2019s original course through Canonbury has now been turned into an ornamental walk.</p>\\n<h2>Synagogues and Jewish life</h2>\\n\\n<p>Other religious institutions existed nearby. Jews fleeing the pogroms of the Russian Empire established a congregation by 1876, and built the Dalston Synagogue in adjoining Poets Road in 1885. This became one of the leading synagogues of London, with Jacob Koussevitzsky as its cantor from 1936.</p>\\n<p>For a period from the end of the nineteenth century, the Newington Green Area was host to a large Jewish population, which was beginning to leave the East End and move northwards towards Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill. The original Adath Israel orthodox congregation was founded in 1911 and its first permanent building was in Alma Road, off Green Lanes, before moving on towards Stoke Newington and the other side of Clissold Park in the 1950s. A large United Synagogue was built in Poets Road in the 1870s and remained active until it closed down in the late 1960s, as the remaining Jewish population moved on further afield. At its height, the Poets Road Synagogue (or as it was known the Dalston Synagogue despite the fact that it was not in Dalston - well, in fact, it was originally very close to Dalson Junction Station) had hundreds of worshippers (unlikely as it had only 400 male members at that time  and, for a short while in the 1930s, was the home of one of the world's leading cantors, a member of the Kusevitsky family.</p>\\n<p>The synagogue site was eventually sold and the beautiful building, along with its stained glass windows, was demolished in 1970 and replaced by a block of council flats, leaving no trace of the Jewish life which existed in this area.</p>\\n<h2>19th century</h2>\\n<p>The early part of the 19th century saw a change in the character of Newington Green. After a patient struggle of 150 years, the English Dissenters were finally freed from their civil disabilities with the passage of the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813. With, it seemed, nothing left to fight for on that front, Nonconformists no longer needed the security of the Newington Green, and the area lost some of its intellectual cohesiveness. The church touched a low point. The nature of Newington Green had changed\\u2014the fresh bucolic village had been swallowed up by London's relentless growth, and had become a <i>\\\"thriving and expanding suburb\\\"</i>. With this growth of prosperity also came a tide of poverty, and this was to prove the mission for the Victorian era. A hundred years before, the ethos had been one of almost Puritan self-reliance, but now the Dickensian poverty, evident in cholera epidemics and rampant malnutrition, made social responsibility an urgent necessity. The minister who guided the first 25 years of this (1839\\u201364) was Thomas Cromwell, FSA (1792\\u20131870). (Like many Anglican vicars, one of his hobbies was local history.) In 1840, a Sunday school was set up for poor children, and soon thereafter a Domestic Mission Society, to visit the poor in their homes. A library and a savings club emphasised self-help. A regular day school ran from 1860 for ten years, until primary education became the responsibility of the state with the passing of the Elementary Education Act 1870.</p>\\n<p>The <i>\\\"small but energetic community\\\"</i> continued to campaign on the larger political stage. Religious freedom and self-improvement were their watchwords. In the last decades of the 19th century, the church thrived and its congregation grew to 80 subscribers. The London Sunday School Society recognised the one at Newington Green as the best in its class, educating up to 200 children and necessitating the construction in 1887 of the schoolhouse immediately behind the main church building. A range of groups sprang up, ranging from intellectual (a Society for Mutual Theological Study) to recreational (cycling and cricket). Young men's and young women's groups met, as did the mothers' meeting, a Provident Society, and teetotalism (abstinence from alcohol) support for adults and children. Other issues of concern were education, social reform and women's suffrage.</p>\\n<p>Some individuals who lived at the Green during this period included Thomas Rees, the minister after Barbauld, who was a leading authority of the history of Unitarianism, and made connections with the Unitarian Church of Transylvania. Alexander Gilchrist, son of another minister, was the biographer of William Blake. Andrew Pritchard improved the microscope and studied microscopic organisms; he was a friend of Michael Faraday and for him, science and religion were one. He led the Newington Green Conversation Society, membership restricted to 16, a successor to the Mutual Instruction Society. Marian Pritchard is described as an unsung heroine, and <i>\\\"one of the leaders of modern Unitarianism\\\"</i>. She set up Oxford Summer Schools for the training of Sunday School teachers and Winifred House Invalid Children's Convalescent Home. John Stuart Mill recalls his family living in Newington Green \\\"from 1810 to the end of 1813\\\"; it was at the time <i>\\\"an almost rustic neighbourhood\\\"</i>, and it was during walks with his father before breakfast <i>\\\"generally in the green lanes towards Hornsey\\\"</i> (<i>\\\"my earliest recollections of green fields and wild flowers\\\"</i>) that John Stuart would recount to James Mill what he had learnt reading the previous day.</p>\\n<h2>20th century</h2>\\n<p>Then came 1914, and the horrors of World War I. Men from Newington Green fell in battle. Meanwhile, many of the older people with long family ties to Newington Green simply died. The professional middle class had largely left the area. By 1930 <i>\\\"it was whispered that the church could not survive\\\"</i>, but it did, with an influential supporter, an alderman and councillor in the Borough of Stoke Newington. Although attendance at services was low, other activities drew in crowds: 100 to the temperance meetings, for example. The outbreak of World War II meant that children were evacuated temporarily from London, so the Sunday Schools and Young People's Leagues ceased for a time. The Sunday services never missed a week, however, even when the building was badly damaged by a landmine blast: they just moved to the schoolhouse. After the war, the ministry focused on building bridges between races and faiths, e.g. with the Jewish community of North London, and was recognised by the World Congress of Faiths. Services were often attended by local politicians, including the mayor of Stoke Newington. Leaders for the national Unitarian movement continued to be found within the congregation at Newington Green.</p>\\n<h2>Newington Green today</h2>\\n\\n<p>The Green, far from being a pleasant and well-manicured garden square, was for many years just a run-down green space that straddled the border between Islington N1 and Hackney N16. However, in 1979 the Newington Green Action Group (NGAG) was formed with the aim of regenerating the area. NGAG worked with Islington Council on this project and traffic calming measures were installed to ease the notorious local congestion, with additional pedestrian crossings providing easier and safer access to the Green on foot. The Green itself was regenerated to include more lawn space, a play area and a caf\\u00e9. New planting has enhanced the Green and was chosen to encourage biodiversity.</p>\\n<p>Newington Green has grown in popularity with the local community, evinced by the children that now play in the formerly deserted park, which is once more being used like a village green. Community groups hold fairs on the Green and NGAG has organised many events including the annual Jazz on the Green and Open Garden Squares day. These improvements are such that in 2006, Newington Green won the first of many Green Flag Awards (the national standard for parks and green spaces in England and Wales, sponsored by Keep Britain Tidy). It has also won the Green Heritage Site Award for several years running, which is sponsored by English Heritage. In 2010 NGAG teamed up with the Mayville Gardening Club and the King Henry's Walk Community Garden; the Newington Green area was awarded a High Silver Gilt Royal Horticultural Society Urban Communities Award, as part of the London in Bloom Scheme.</p>\\n<p>The Newington Green Action Group also published a local history book <i>The Village That Changed the World: A History of Newington Green London N16</i> by Alex Allardyce in 2008, which won the Walter Bor Award the following year.</p>\\n<p>Newington Green and Newington Green Road to the south constitute the commercial and cultural centre of the district. This area shares in the gentrification of Islington and Stoke Newington, so the old shopping area has now been supplemented by a number of new and trendy shops, bars and restaurants. However, there is a substantial Turkish Cypriot community in the area, members of whom run many of the local grocery stores.</p>\\n<p>Since the millennium, two new ministers at the Unitarian Church have injected energy into the Green and added to its events and publicity. Cathal (Cal) Courtney, characterised as a \\\"radical spirit\\\" who had made a \\\"remarkable spiritual journey\\\", opened the church for a multi-faith silent protest vigil through the night before the huge march against the Iraq War. He used his inaugural column in the <i>N16 magazine</i> to address the international furore around Gene Robinson's election as bishop. He was written about as the Right-On Reverend in <i>The Oldie'</i>s monthly \\\"East of Islington\\\" column. Courtney revived the Richard Price Memorial Lecture, which had last been given in 1981. NGUC now sponsors it annually, to \\\"(address) a topical or important aspect of liberty, reason and ethics.\\\"</p>\\n<p>The current minister is Andrew (Andy) Pakula, an American who grew up in a secular Jewish family in New York. Newington Green Unitarian Church made history when it became the first religious establishment in Britain to refuse to carry out any weddings at all until same-sex couples have the right to full legal marriage. The BBC called it a \\\"gay rights church\\\" for its unanimous committee vote suspending full wedding services.</p>\\n<p>NGUC celebrated its tercentenary in 2008 under the slogan \\\"300 years of dissent\\\", marking this with events such as planting a crab apple tree, organising a picnic in conjunction with the Newington Green Action Group, and hosting a concert of Ottoman classical music. (Newington Green has a strong Turkish population.) The following year it commemorated the 250th anniversary of the birth of Mary Wollstonecraft, attaching a large banner to the railings outside the building, proclaiming it the \\\"birthplace of feminism\\\", in a nod to the formative years that she spent worshipping there. NGUC sponsored a series of events, including a return visit and lecture by biographer Barbara Taylor; a panel discussion about women and power, between female politicians Diane Abbott MP, Jean Lambert MEP, and Emily Thornberry MP; an art exhibition entitled Mother of Feminism; a concert featuring Carol Grimes and Adey Grummet to raise money for Stop the Traffik, an anti-trafficking charity; a tombstone tribute at St Pancras Old Church; a birthday cake baked by men; and other activities.</p>\\n<p>Weekly poetry readings are held at NGUC. It participates in the annual festival of architecture, Open House London. It hosts occasional concerts, such as that given by the London Gallery Quire, and the Psallite Women's Choir.</p>\\n<h2>Cafe and building in the park</h2>\\n<p>In July 2013 a new cafe called \\\"Lizzy's on the Green\\\" opened in the kiosk on the green.</p>\\n<h2>Listed buildings</h2>\\n\\n<p>This outlying area of Islington carries a surprising wealth of historic architecture and Newington Green has become a conservation area. On the west side of the Green (numbers 52-55) is London's oldest surviving brick terrace, which is Grade I listed. These were built in 1658, and 100 years later were home to Price and Rogers. Shop fronts were added to all of them in the 1880s, but have now been removed on three of the houses, presumably restoring something like their original appearance. Residential London, particularly outside Westminster and the City, is essentially a 19th-century city. Even in the centre, there are no brick houses this old, pre-dating the Great Fire of 1666. Two of the properties have been extensively renovated under the guidance of Bere Architects (Islington).</p>\\n<p>The Green also has two Grade II listed buildings. To the north is the Unitarian Church, which celebrated its tercentenary in 2008. The original 1708 building was financed with \\u00a3300 from goldsmith Edward Harrison. It was a <i>\\\"substantial brick building, of nearly square form, with the high, tiled, projecting roof, common at its era\\\"</i>. <i>\\\"Historic views show that the original fa\\u00e7ade had a small pediment against a large hipped roof, with a central oval window below.\\\"</i> This building was substantially extended and improved in the mid-19th century. An internal gallery was built to increase the seating available, and a few years later the roof and apse were renewed, and a <i>\\\"stuccoed frontage\\\"</i> was built, <i>\\\"mirrroring the original fa\\u00e7ade with a three-bay front with two round-headed windows, but with added Tuscan pilasters and a large pediment\\\"</i>. In the mid-20th century, the building was damaged by enemy action. In 1953 its architectural importance was recognised as a Grade II listed building.</p>\\n<p>To the west is its neighbour, the former headquarters of the China Inland Mission, an organisation founded by James Hudson Taylor in 1865 and responsible for 18,000 converts to Christianity.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\\n<ul><li><i>The Village that Changed the World: A History of Newington Green London N16</i> by Alex Allardyce.</li>\\n<li><i>Vindication: A Life of Mary Wollstonecraft</i> by Lyndall Gordon.

It is bounded by Hackney Road to the south, Kingsland Road to the west, Middleton Road to the north, with London Fields and Broadway Market to the east. In the 1990s a number of the area's more rundown housing estates were refurbished and some disused public buildings were privately converted into gated communities.</p>\\n<p>The area has the 9th highest crime rate in Hackney. [1]</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Origin</h2>\\n\\n<p>Haggerston is first recorded in the Domesday Book as <i>Hergotestane</i>, possibly of Viking origin, and an outlying hamlet of Shoreditch. On Rocque's 1745 map of Hackney, the village is shown as <i>Agostone</i> but by the 19th century it had become part of the growing urban sprawl, with factories and streets of workers' cottages lining the canal.</p>\\n<h2>Today</h2>\\n<p>The proximity to Hoxton and Shoreditch has made the area popular with students and workers in the creative industries, as these nearby areas have grown more expensive. In recent years, escalating property prices have driven commercial art galleries further into east London, which has exacerbated this effect.</p>\\n<p>A shortage of secondary school places has made the area less attractive to families but this is likely to change with the building of a City Academy on Laburnum Street.</p>\\n<p>Many Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian people have formed communities in Haggerston and nearby Shoreditch. Outside the area, the most visible sign of this is the profusion of Southeast Asian restaurants on nearby Kingsland Road in Shoreditch and on Mare Street in Hackney. There is also a notable Russian community focused on bars and caf\\u00e9s along Kingsland Road.</p>\\n<h2>Amenities</h2>\\n\\n<p>Besides the Regents Canal, Haggerston Park, on the site of a demolished gasworks on Hackney Road, provides much-needed open space in the area. Also in the area is the Hackney City Farm. The Regent Estate provides the Regent Estate Pensioners Club/Hall and the Regent Estate Community Center/Hall which together provide community services and spaces for hire. The Regent Estate Pensioners Hall is also used as a Polling Station.</p>\\n<p>The Grade II listed Haggerston Pool, designed by Alfred Cross and opened in 1904, was closed in 2000. In June 2009, after a long community campaign, a \\u00a35m grant was announced from the Department for Children, Schools and Families to refurbish and re-open the pool. The building would also contain community facilities and a GP surgery.</p>\\n<p>Haggerston School is a Grade II listed building, designed by modernist architect Ern\\u0151 Goldfinger and built in 1964\\u201365.</p>\\n<p>This area of Hackney has a long association with clowning. Holy Trinity Church still hosts an annual clowns' service to commemorate Joseph Grimaldi and All Saints Centre at one time housed the Clowns Gallery and Museum, including props and a unique collection of painted eggs, serving as the 'registration' of clowns' make-up. Much of the collection is now on display at Wookey Hole. Other Anglican churches in Haggerston are All Saints, Haggerston Road; St Columba, Kingsland Road; and Sts Mary and Chad, Nichols Square.</p>\\n<h2>Ward</h2>\\n<p>The Haggerston electoral ward forms part of the Hackney South and Shoreditch constituency.</p>\\n<p>The ward returns three councillors to Hackney Council, with an election every four years. At the election on 6 May 2010, Ann Munn, Jonathan McShane, and Barry Buitekant, all Labour Party candidates, were returned.

In 2009 artists Andrea Luka Zimmerman and Lasse Johansson, who lived on the Haggerston Estate on Dunston Road, created the I AM HERE project, placing on the building large portrait photographs of the current estate residents who were about to be moved out so the building could be demolished. These faced the Regent's Canal and were popular with passersby. The project came down in April 2014.</p>\\n<p>On the Kingsland Estate in Whiston Road, Egyptian painter Nazir Tanbouli created the \\\"King's Land\\\" project where, in the space of 4 months, he covered all of the buildings of the condemned estate with murals.

Goldfinger knew both architects personally. The elevations of the school follow the mathematical proportions of the Golden Section and it includes a double-height circulation spine with balcony.

It is roughly in the area between Essex Road, Upper Street and Cross Street and either side of St Paul's Road. In 1253 land in the area was granted to the Canons of St Bartholomew\\u2019s Priory, Smithfield and became known as Canonbury. The area continued predominantly as open land until it was developed as a suburb in the early 19th century. In common with similar inner London areas, it suffered decline when the construction of railways in the 1860s enabled commuting into the city from further afield. The gentrification of the area from the 1950s included new developments to replace war-damaged properties in Canonbury Park North and South as well as restoration of older buildings.</p>\\n<p>East Canonbury is the south-eastern corner of the district, bordering on the Regents Canal. Parts of this area were transferred to the district from the London Borough of Hackney in a boundary adjustment (along the line of the northern tow-path of the canal), in 1993.</p>\\n<p>In the east is the New River Estate (formerly the Marquess Estate), a 1,200 dwelling council estate, completed in 1976 on 26 acres (110,000\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>), and designed by Darbourne &amp; Darke. A dark red brick, traffic free estate, it was praised as an example of municipal architecture, but acquired a bad reputation and has since been extensively redeveloped to improve security for residents.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Literary and artistic connections</h2>\\n\\n<p>George Orwell moved to 27b Canonbury Square in the autumn of 1944 - he and his wife having been bombed out of their previous flat, in Mortimer Crescent, on 28 June 1944. Evelyn Waugh lived at 17a Canonbury Square from 1928 to 1930. Charles Dickens wrote a Christmas story about a lamplighter in Canonbury, which features the Tower. Leslie Forbes, the travel and detective story writer, and amateur historian Gavin Menzies both live in the area.</p>\\n<h2>Places of interest</h2>\\n<ul><li><b>Canonbury Tower</b> - The manor house of Canonbury was constructed by William Bolton of St Bartholomew\\u2019s Priory between 1509 and 1532. At the dissolution it was granted to Thomas Cromwell. In the 1590s the manor house was rebuilt by Sir John Spencer, Lord Mayor of the City of London, including the construction of its tower. The tower has been occupied by many historical figures, including Francis Bacon and Oliver Goldsmith. The Tower Theatre Company was based here from 1953 to 2003. It is currently used as a Masonic research centre.</li>\\n<li><b>Canonbury Square</b> - An attractive square, developed between 1805 and 1830, it includes a variety of distinct styles. In 1812, when few properties had been built, the New North Road turnpike, now known as Canonbury Road, was constructed and bisects the square. Many significant figures from the arts and literary worlds have lived on the square, including George Orwell, Evelyn Waugh and Samuel Phelps.</li>\\n<li><b>The Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art</b> is in Canonbury Square.</li>\\n<li><b>New River Walk</b> - The New River, an aqueduct built by Sir Hugh Myddelton to supply fresh water to London, was completed in 1613. The walk is in two parts, with a break at Willowbridge. The southern section received an early National Lottery grant, and has a back-pumping scheme which simulates the water flow of the original aqueduct.</li>\\n<li><b>Canonbury Grove</b> - a road running parallel to part of New River Walk, made up of typical attractive 2 and 3 storey early 19th century terraces.</li>\\n</ul><h2>Churches</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>St Paul's Church, Canonbury, is a fine building that has become somewhat dilapidated; it is used as a social centre and twinned with St Jude's church nearby.</li>\\n<li>St Stephen's Church, Church of England</li>\\n</ul><h2>Groups in Canonbury</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>Greenpeace UK - offices based at Canonbury Villas.</li>\\n<li>The Canonbury Society [1] aims to conserve the special character of Canonbury by monitoring development</li>\\n<li>Islington &amp; Stoke Newington (T.S Quail) Sea Cadet Unit</li>\\n<li>The Islington Society [2] was founded in 1960 to safeguard and improve the quality of life in Islington.

The one-day event was held at the end of June 2003, on Clapham Common with a capacity of 10,000. Tickets for the event sold out in two days. The event consisted of one live main stage, three smaller dance stages plus bars and food stalls.</p>\\n<p>In 2004, the event was repeated with an expanded capacity of 20,000. The event sold out within three days. Lovebox also hosted a sister festival on Newcastle Racecourse followed by an after party.</p>\\n<p>In 2005, Lovebox moved to Victoria Park in Tower Hamlets. The festival expanded to two days and a capacity of 25,000. The event was co-headlined by Groove Armada and Mylo and featured four dance tents, two cabaret arenas, a 1900s Spiegel tent and a funfair.</p>\\n<p>From 2007 until 2008, Lovebox hosted a sister event in Dublin.</p>\\n<p>By 2009, Lovebox had increased to a capacity of 50,000 and a 40-acre (160,000\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>) site.</p>\\n<p>Lovebox has also hosted nights at The End, Turnmills, Neighbourhood, Canvas, The Key and The Ministry of Sound in London and elsewhere in Brighton, Dublin, Belfast, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Ibiza, as well as an annual summer boat party, which ran until 2008.</p>\\n<p>For 2010, the festival has been expanded to a three-day event, notable however for the fact that Groove Armada are missing from the lineup.</p>\\n<p>Lovebox 2014 has been reduced back to a two-day event.</p>\\n<h2>Festival culture</h2>\\n<p>Despite starting out as a predominantly dance festival, Lovebox has since expanded to include a wide variety of musical genres including indie, rock, world and pop, as well as circus performers, cabaret and fringe acts. In 2009 the festival hosted seven stages, supported by various partnerships from brands including Gaymers Cider, Relentless and Rizla.</p>\\n<p>Lovebox is also known for being a very creative-led event, with stages and areas being elaborately built and dressed. The 2009 festival site featured a tree house, a bowling alley, a vintage fashion fair and a healing and massage area as well as several themed bars and eating areas.</p>\\n<p>Being based in central London, yet still encompassing many of the features of country-set events such as Glastonbury and Secret Garden Party, Lovebox has developed a reputation for being an \\u201curban-based-yet-rural-feeling, multi-dimensional festival \\u2013 without the camping or the endless tramping about.\\u201d The event is also fully accessible \\u2013 being set in a public park, Lovebox avoids many of the usual pitfalls that befall disabled attendees at other festivals \\u2013 and family friendly \\u2013 with a children\\u2019s area and family friendly performances on their Fringe stage.</p>\\n<p>The Lovebox Festival has won a selection of awards.

It stretches out across part of the East End of London, England bordering parts of Bethnal Green, Hackney, and Bow, such as along Old Ford Road, London E3 and Victoria Park Road E9. The park is entirely within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The park has two cafes, The Pavilion Cafe in the West and The Park Cafe in the East. There are two playgrounds, one on either side of the park, as well as sporting facilities and a skatepark in the East. The park is home to many historic artifacts and features and has decorative gardens and wilder natural areas as well as open grass lands. Victoria Park is also used as a concert venue and hosts many festivals each year. The park is approximately a mile away from the London Olympic Park. Owing to its proximity to the Olympic park, it became a venue for the BT London Live event along with Hyde Park during the London 2012 Olympic Games. The park has in recent years gone through a 12 million pound refurbishment and many of the park's old features have been reinstated or repaired.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Origins</h2>\\n<p>The Crown Estate purchased 218 acres (88\\u00a0ha) which were laid out by notable London planner and architect Sir James Pennethorne between 1842 and 1846. A part of the area was known as Bonner Fields, after Bishop Bonner, the last lord of the manor of Stepney. The land had originally been parkland, associated with the Bishop's Palace, but by the mid-1800s had been spoiled by the extraction of gravel, and clay for bricks.</p>\\n<p>It was opened to the public in 1845. This large park is reminiscent of Regent's Park (not least because the latter was designed by Pennethorne's teacher John Nash), though much less busy, and is considered by some as the finest park in the East End. It is bounded on two sides by canals: the Regent's Canal lies to the west, while its branch, once known as the Hertford Union Canal runs along the Southern edge of the park. There is a gate named after Edmund Bonner. Guarding the main entrance at Sewardstone Road are replica statues of the Dogs of Alcibiades, the originals of which stood here from 1912 to 2009 until vandalism led to their being removed, restored and rehoused elsewhere in the Park.</p>\\n\\n<p>Two pedestrian alcoves, surviving fragments of the old London Bridge, demolished in 1831, are located at the east end of the park near the Hackney Wick war memorial where they were placed in 1860. They were part of the 1760 refurbishment of the 600 year old bridge, by Sir Robert Taylor and George Dance the Younger, and provided protection for pedestrians on the narrow carriageway. The insignia of the Bridge Association can be seen inside these alcoves. The alcoves have been Grade II listed, since 1951.</p>\\n<p>The Lido opened in 1936 and reopened in 1952 following damage during the Second World War; it was closed in 1986 and demolished in 1990.</p>\\n<h2>The People's Park</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the latter half of the 19th Century, Victoria Park became an essential amenity for the working classes of the East End. For some East End children in the 1880s, this may have been the only large stretch of uninterrupted greenery they ever encountered. Facilities like the Bathing Pond (picture right)\\u00a0\\u2014later superseded by the park lido\\u2014would have introduced many to swimming in an era when many public baths (like that at Shacklewell) were still simply communal washing facilities.</p>\\n<p>Victoria Park's reputation as the 'People's Park' grew as it became a centre for political meetings and rallies of all stripes, perhaps exceeding in importance the more well-known Hyde Park in this regard. The park occupies the interface between Tower Hamlets\\u00a0\\u2014 sunk in poverty in the 19th century and with a strong tradition of socialist and revolutionary agitation\\u00a0\\u2014 and Hackney, more genteel, but heir to a centuries-old legacy of religious dissent and non-conformism that led to its own fierce brand of reformism. So it should come as no surprise that the scene at the numerous Speaker's Corners was a lively one.</p>\\n<p>Although any one could set up their own soapbox, the biggest crowds were usually drawn to 'star' socialist speakers such as William Morris and Annie Besant.</p>\\n\\n<p>This description by J. H. Rosney, correspondent for <i>Harper's Magazine</i> (February 1888) evokes a scene:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<p>On the big central lawn are scattered numerous groups, some of which are very closely packed. Almost all the religious sects of England and all the political and social parties are preaching their ideas and disputing [...]</p>\\n<p>On this lawn the listener, as his fancy prompts him, may assist on Malthusianism, atheism, agnosticism, secularism, Calvinism, socialism, anarchism, Salvationism, Darwinism, and even, in exceptional cases, Swedenborgianism and Mormonism. I once heard there a prophet, a man who professed to be inspired by the Holy Ghost; but this prophet ended by being locked up in an asylum, where he will have to convert the doctor before he can recover his liberty.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The tradition of public speaking in the park continued until well after the Second World War, and was still later reflected in politically oriented rock concerts, such as those held by Rock Against Racism and the Anti-Nazi League in the 1970s and 1980s. And it is still not uncommon for marches or demonstrations to begin or end in Victoria Park.</p>\\n<p>On 26th June 2014, a campaign to revive the Speakers' Corner at Victoria Park was launched at a democratic theatre event held in Shoreditch Town Hall. Hosted by The People Speak, a participatory campaign and events group, 66 audience members deliberated over how to used the pooled cash revenue from their tickets, and eventually voted to recreate the well-known tradition of free speech and debate in Hyde Park in East London's Victoria Park. The campaign is due to formally launch in July 2014.</p>\\n<h2>Second World War</h2>\\n\\n<p>During the Second World War, Victoria Park was largely closed to the public and effectively became one huge Ack-Ack (anti-aircraft) site. The gun emplacements conveniently straddled the path of German Luftwaffe bombers looping north west after attacking the docks and warehouses further south in what is now Tower Hamlets, and so the park was of some strategic importance.</p>\\n<p>More controversially, anti-aircraft activity in the park has been implicated in the crowd panic that caused the Bethnal Green tube disaster of 1943. Some eyewitness accounts have led to the suggestion that, after several air raid alerts, the panic run for shelter was caused by a gigantic explosion of noise from the direction of the park. A BBC documentary on the event suggests that this was due to the first firing of the new Z-Battery anti-aircraft rockets. The UK Ministry of Defence, however, disputes this account.</p>\\n<h2>Modern times</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1986 the Greater London Council transferred responsibility for the park to the London borough of Tower Hamlets and the London Borough of Hackney, through a joint management board. Since 1994 Tower Hamlets has run the park alone.</p>\\n<p>In recent times, Victoria Park became noted for its open-air music festivals, often linked with a political cause. The 1980 rock docudrama <i>Rude Boy</i> features The Clash playing at an Anti-Nazi League event in the park. Radiohead played two concerts in the park on 24\\u201325 June 2008. Madness celebrated their 30th year with a fifth Madstock there on 17 July 2009. The park has also become very popular amongst dance music's biggest names; Dutch DJ Ti\\u00ebsto played at Victoria Park in 2009 and again in 2010. On 24\\u201325 July 2010, Victoria Park was the site of the first High Voltage Festival. Victoria Park has also hosts Field Day, The Apple Cart, Underage Festival and Lovebox Festival.</p>\\n<p>For children, Victoria Park is host to: a <i>One O'Clock Club</i> for under-fives and a programme of summer activities and a children's play park including a paddling pool that runs from 1-5pm in the summer months.</p>\\n<p>The oldest model boat club in the world, the Victoria Model Steam Boat Club, founded in the Park on 15 July 1904, is still active today and holds up to 17 of their Sunday regattas a year. The VMSB Club runs straight-running boats just as they did 100 years ago but have also progressed to radio controlled boats and hydroplanes. The first Regatta is traditionally held on Easter Sunday and the Steam Regatta is always held on the first Sunday in July.</p>\\n<p>The Park is also the home of Tower Hamlets Football Club and Victoria Park United Football club, Victoria Park Harriers &amp; Tower Hamlets Athletics Club, which has its headquarters at St. Augustine's Hall located at the north-east corner of the Park. The Club celebrated its 80th Anniversary in 2006.</p>\\n<p>During the summer cricket is played every evening on the park's three all-weather wickets, organised by the Victoria Park Community Cricket League. The park also has a popular three-lane cricket net, free to use at all times. It was refurbished to a high standard at the end of 2005, paid for by a grant from the England and Wales Cricket Board.</p>\\n<p>The park is open daily from 6:00am to dusk.</p>\\n\\n<p>In 2010 the National Lottery Big Lottery Fund awarded the London Borough of Tower Hamlets a \\u00a34.5\\u00a0million grant towards a \\u00a312\\u00a0million programme of major improvements to Victoria Park. Plans included a new building, the Eastern Hub, comprising a cafe, public toilets, community rooms and adult play facilities to promote healthy living.</p>\\n<p>The landscape has been restored in many places, and the Old English gardens restored to include new water features. In 1842 a pagoda was put in London's Hyde Park as an entrance to its Chinese Exhibit, and when the exhibit finished it was moved to Victoria Park's island in the west boating lake for ornamental purposes. The original architect for the park, Pennethorne, designed a bridge to the island that matched the style of the pagoda; this was never built, however, and during WW2 the pagoda suffered much damage.</p>\\n<p>The pagoda was eventually demolished in the 1950s and all but forgotten, while the water surrounding the island was filled in, shrinking the lake and making what was the island part of the park landscape. With the parks refurbishments that began in 2010 it was decided to restore the island to its former glory; the lake was extended back around the original area, the pagoda was replicated through the use of many photographs and eye-witness information and then, to complete Pennethorne's unfinished vision, the plans for his original bridge were discovered and the bridge built. It took over 100 years, but Pennethorne's vision was finally completed. As a finishing touch, pedallos and row boats were brought back on to the West lake, a feature which had been missing from the park for decades.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Burdett-Coutts fountain (named after Angela Burdett-Coutts the Victorian philanthropist) had a partial restoration of its intricate granite carvings and sculptures. In recent years the fountain had been fenced off due to graffiti and vandalism, but along with the restoration the fences were removed, and four symmetrical mirror pools were placed around the fountain along with decorative flower beds. The area is now a public space, with many benches offering an attractive place to sit.</p>\\n<p>A modern addition to the park is the Memoryscape trail, an audio trail winding through the park that visitors listen to using headphones. The trail consists of many historical facts and tidbits of information, and includes accounts from people who grew up in and around the park, with one person for example reminiscing about the prisoner of war camp in the park during World War 2. Visitors can either download the tracks from the council's website and put them on their own device, or they can get a pair of pre-loaded headphones from the hub in exchange for a small refundable deposit.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<p>London Buses Routes 277, 425 serve the heart of the park, 8, 399, D6, and Night Route N8 on Roman Road. 309 and D3 at London Chest Hospital via Approach Road. 388 (westbound) on Victoria Park Road.</p>\\n<p>Mile End tube station for the Central line, District line, Hammersmith &amp; City line services to Stratford, Upminster, Barking or Central London is 10min via Grove Road, you can take the 277 or 425 to Mile End which is 5min away. Cambridge Heath station for National Rail services to Liverpool Street and Enfield or Chingford is 5mins away via Bishops Way.</p>\\n<p>The Regent's Canal and Hertford Union Canal is located next to the park; this offers to access to walk or cycle on its towpaths. Mare Street or Mile End or Hackney Wick can easily be reached from here. The National Cycle Route 1 (NCR1) passes here on the Hertford Union Canal.</p>\\n<p>The Greenway walk/cycle path to Beckton via Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and Newham General Hospital starts nearby at the far end of the park.</p>\\n<h2>Awards</h2>\\n<p>In summer 2008, the park was voted London's best local park by <i>Time Out</i> magazine. In 2011 it won its first Green Flag award (which it has won every year since,) and it was again voted London's favourite park, this time in the national People's Choice Award. In 2013/14 Victoria Park was also certified a Green Heritage Site by English Heritage and Keep Britain Tidy, an award given in recognition of achieving the required standard in the management and interpretation of a site with local or national historic importance, it retained this award in the following 2014/2015 year.</p>\\n<p>In 2013 the park came second in a national vote to find the public's favourite Green Flag Awarded park, beaten only by Margam Country Park in south Wales from a field of 1,448 qualifying open spaces.</p>\\n<p>In 2014 Victoria Park reinstated itself as the most popular park in the UK with over 13000 votes in the Green Flag Peoples Choice Awards.</p>\\n<h2>In popular culture</h2>\\n<ul><li>Appears in the feature film 'Pride.'

In 1719, <b>the Lower School</b> opened. It has moved many times and the school now has two separate buildings, one for Years 7 and 8, and one for Year 9 and above. From September 2010, due to BSF works the Lower School site will accommodate Years 7 to 8, with Years 9 to 13 remaining at the Upper School. The school has a low rate of A and A* grades at A Level.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Admissions</h2>\\n<p>It is situated in the north of Bethnal Green, just to the east of <i>Cambridge Heath Road</i> (A107) and half a mile south of the Regent's Canal and not far from the Cambridge Heath railway station. It is opposite the London Chest Hospital, just off the Old Ford Road (B118) and in the parish of St James-the-Less, Bethnal Green. It is one of six schools in the borough that has a sixth form.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>Henry Raine had made a good sum of money from selling alcohol. However he was a devout Christian, and he knew that he should use his wealth for good. He decided to found a school where poor children could get a free education. He built it in Wapping, where he lived and named it \\\"the Lower School\\\". It opened in 1719.</p>\\n<p>\\\"The Lower School\\\", was designed to provide an education for fifty boys and fifty girls between the ages of 8 and 18 years. They would learn \\\"the three Rs\\\", which were reading, writing and arithmetic. Girls however were also taught to sew and to cook, and boys were also made to shovel coal underground for the school's heating, and to scrub the floors. This was done in between periods.</p>\\n<h3>Boarding school</h3>\\n<p>In 1736 Henry built and set aside money for a boarding school which would take on forty girls from the Lower School. It was known as \\\"Raine's Hospital\\\" and later \\\"Asylum\\\"(this did not have the connotations it has today). It would have been quite pleasant, with clothes being provided along with frequent meals.</p>\\n<p>The boys and the girls were separated at first and the boys would be beaten if caught talking to a girl. Because of this a fence was put up between the boarding and lower school.</p>\\n<p>In 1820, a new boys' school was opened as there was a large increase in boys at the lower school which was only a boys' school, the girls had the boarding school but were soon to move to the Lower School. It was opened in Silver Street by the Duke of Clarence who was later King William IV.</p>\\n<p>In 1883, the boarding school closed and a new boys' and girls' school opened in Cannon Street Road. Not all places were free anymore, it was 3d a week for the preparatory school and 6d for the senior school.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Former site</h3>\\n<p>In 1913, the school moved to Arbour Square in Stepney, the building still stands today and is part of Tower Hamlets College. It was state of the art with its gymnasium, science laboratories, a girls' cookery room and in World War I a rifle range was built on the open rooftop for boys who could prepare for the army which they would fight in against the Germans. The separation for boys and girls continued until 1964, even the hall was separated by a hinged folding wooden dividing wall.</p>\\n<h3>Comprehensive</h3>\\n<p>In 1977, Raine's merged with St Jude's Secondary School and became a comprehensive school.</p>\\n<p>In 1985, the school moved to Old Bethnal Green Road (the lower school for years 7 and 8), and the old Parmiter's building in Approach Road. Both are in Bethnal Green and remain there until today. The Upper School site is being redeveloped from Summer 2010 as part of the Building Schools for the Future project. This will result in Year 9 being based in the Lower School building.</p>\\n<h2>Motto</h2>\\n<p>The motto was devised when the school opened. It was:</p>\\n<dl><dd><i>\\\"Come in and do your duty to God and man\\\".</i></dd>\\n</dl><p>It has, however, been changed to:</p>\\n<dl><dd><i>\\\"Come in and learn your duty to God and man\\\".</i></dd>\\n</dl><h2>Ethos and events</h2>\\n<p>The general ethos of the school has a friendly feel to it. The social integration of the pupils is good, as is their relationship with the teachers. Events include talent shows held regularly in the school at the end of terms. These are occasions when the pupils can show off talents or skills to their fellow pupils. The most recent was at Summer 2009.</p>\\n<h2>Uniform</h2>\\n<p>When it first opened it had a boys' uniform: cap, long coat with buttons (the neck button always had to be done up), tights and high heel-like shoes.

At some point in 2008 it is proposed that lower and upper schools will temporarily be merged in order to allow building work to take place at the lower school site with the current building being demolished. Due to its age, the upper school buildings shall remain but the interiors will receive refurbishment. The old Headteacher, Gordon Clubb, moved from temporary Head to a permanent position in 2007-2013.</p>\\n<h2>Academic performance</h2>\\n<p>It gets GCSE and A level results slightly under the England average.

The youngest classes follow a Montessori-style education, but the influence of the national curriculum has brought the older classes more into line with mainstream schools. The school admits children from the full ability range, with an emphasis on the Arts, including visits to museums and theatres, as well as sports and outward bound activities.</p>\\n<p>The School was originally founded in Smithfield, London by Phyllis Wallbank, in 1948. It was originally housed in the Gatehouse of St Bartholomew-the-Great church in Smithfield but moved to Bethnal Green in the 1970s. It has been run along Montessori method principles developed by the educationalist Maria Montessori and initially served children from 2 \\u2013 16 years of age, and at the time of its founding, was quite untraditional in its educational philosophy. The school's 60th anniversary in 2008 was marked by a service in the school's original home, St Bartholomew's in Smithfield.</p>\\n<p>The School integrates children with a wide range of disabilities with able-bodied children. It follows the idea that true learning resulted from children exploring the world for themselves through play. It allows children to choose when to take their lessons during the week. A child is required to complete a certain number of lessons in Mathematics, English, Art, Geography etc. per week but would be able to decide when to do them. Students also have free lessons where they can choose any subject they like. The balance of subjects are often weighted towards a child's aptitude or current interests. Different abilities/ages of children are taught in the same session, and their teachers 'sign pupils off' for the lessons they have completed. Some older children (14/15 year olds) can then take the amount of each subject they wished to do over the course of each week, resulting in some pupils spending the week doing 'what they want' e.g., Art/Monday, Geography/Tuesday, English/Wednesday, Biology/Thursday and then back to Art/Friday.</p>\\n<p>After an hour for lunch pupils have an hour to read followed by 'afternoon activities'. These include football, swimming, and visits to museums. The school has also had two ponies, as well as a duck, for the children. It also has an old farm cottage just outside Clochan in Scotland.</p>\\n<p>The Gatehouse School featured in several documentary programmes during the 1970s. Saxophonist &amp; Bon Viveur Brian Hardy taught Art &amp; Dance here. Actors Sophie Ward and Linus Roche were pupils.</p>\\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\\n<ul><li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"The Vocation of Teaching.\\\" <i>The Sower: A Quarterly Magazine on Christian Formation</i>.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Moral Teaching through Shakespeare's Tragedies.\\\" <i>The Sower: A Quarterly Magazine on Christian Formation</i>.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"The Way we Learn.\\\" <i>The Sower: A Quarterly Magazine on Christian Formation</i>.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"The Philosophy of International Education.\\\" <i>Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education</i> 12/2 (2001) 193-209.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Periods of Sensitivity within Human Lives.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 12/3 (2001) 337-384.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Savants.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 13/1 (2002) 137-140.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Time.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 14/1 (2003) 1-12.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Montessori and the New Century.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 14/2 (2003) 135-144.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"A Universal Way of Education.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 15/3 (2004) 521-532.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Adolescence.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 18/1 (2007) 77-90.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Dr Maria Montessori: The Past, the Present and the Future.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 18/2 (2007) 149-158.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"A Montessori Journey: Phyllis Wallbank celebrates the life and work of Dr Montessori.\\\" Montessori International Magazine 83 (2007) 32-33.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Imagination.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 20/1 (2009) 107-108.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"War and Time.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 20/2 (2009) 255-258.</li>\\n<li>Coelho, Ivo.

The union with Hackney was very unpopular with the inhabitants of Stoke Newington, and following unsuccessful attempts to end it in 1864, 1880 and 1890, the parish regained independence in 1894. Stoke Newington Vestry consisted of 60 vestrymen, elected from five wards.</p>\\n<p>South Hornsey formed the southern part of the parish of Hornsey, consisting of the Brownswood Park area south of Finsbury Park, 29 acres (0.1\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) of Clissold Park and two detached areas entirely surrounded by the parish of Stoke Newington. The exclaves of South Hornsey effectively cut off the south-eastern section of Stoke Newington from the rest of the parish. A local board was formed to govern the area in 1867, becoming an urban district under the Local Government Act 1894.</p>\\n<h3>Formation</h3>\\n<p>The London Government Act 1899 provided that the County of London should be divided into metropolitan boroughs. The new authorities were to based on existing parishes with simplified boundaries. It was intended that each borough would have a population of between 100,000 and 400,000 inhabitants. Where an area fell below the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants, it might still be constituted a borough if it had a rateable value exceeding 500,000 pounds.</p>\\n<p>Stoke Newington presented a problem, as its population fell well below the prescribed limits. It was recognised that there were three possibilities: to recombine the parishes of Hackney and Stoke Newington into a single borough; to divide the existing parish of Hackney and combine the wealthier northern section with Stoke Newington to form a municipality with the boundaries of the Hackney North parliamentary constituency; or to add neighbouring areas of Middlesex to increase the population. The first two options were rejected as it was recognised that there was <i>\\\"great ill-feeling and mutual ill-will... between the inhabitants of the two districts\\\"</i>, and it was decided to merge the bulk of South Hornsey, with a population about 20,000, with Stoke Newington. While this still created a borough of only about 50,000 inhabitants, and thus <i>\\\"the smallest borough in London, the anomaly would be a gradually diminishing one, because the population in this district was rapidly increasing. When dividing London up into boroughs they could not avoid creating some anomalies as to size.\\\"</i></p>\\n<h3>Boundaries</h3>\\n<p>Under the 1899 legislation, boundary commissioners were appointed to set the boundaries of the new boroughs. The existing parish boundaries frequently divided houses or related to field boundaries that had disappeared with the urbanisation of the area. The commissioners realigned the boundary lines so that for the most part they ran down the centre of roads, railways or watercourses.</p>\\n<p>To the north, the borough had a boundary with Middlesex, marked by the course of the New River and the Seven Sisters Road. Stoke Newington's boundaries with the two neighbouring metropolitan boroughs within the County of London were as follows:</p>\\n<ul><li>Islington to the west and south: the centres of Blackstock Road, Mountgrove Roads, Green Lanes, (diverting to take in Petherton Road and Leconfield Road) Matthias Road and Boleyn Road.</li>\\n<li>Hackney to the east and north east: the centre of the ancient Ermine Street, known here as Kingsland High Street, Stoke Newington Road and Stoke Newington High Street, then following the North London Railway from Stoke Newington railway station to Bethune Road. (The area to the east of the main road, including Stoke Newington Common, never formed part of Stoke Newington administratively, lying within the parish of Hackney).</li>\\n</ul><h2>Coat of arms</h2>\\n\\n<p>The long association with the dean and chapter of St Paul's Cathedral is represented by the red background and crossed swords. The cross is from the arms of William Patten, first lord of the manor and rebuilder of the church of St Mary, in 1550. The trees represent the ancient forest, and the green lion, that of John Dudley. The griffin refers to Daniel Defoe, and the banner, the arms of Sir Thomas Abney.</p>\\n<p>The Latin motto translates as <i>Look to the past and the future</i>, the arms were granted on 12 June 1934.</p>\\n<p>When merged to found the London Borough of Hackney in 1965, oaks from these arms were put in the new coat of arms of the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>The coat of arms of 1934 replaced an unofficial device adopted by the council on incorporation in 1900. At the top of the shield was a representation of the parish church. The lower part of the shield featured the arms of the cities of London and Westminster on the left, and the attributed arms of the Kingdom of Essex representing Middlesex on the right. These armorial devices were chosen to represent the union of Stoke Newington in the County of London and South Hornsey in Middlesex. The crest was formed by a tree, recalling Stoke Newington's origin as a village in the Middlesex Forest.<br clear=\\\"all\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Area and population</h2>\\n<h3>Predecessor authorities</h3>\\n<p>Statistics compiled by the London County Council, in 1901 show the population growth in London, over the preceding century. The figures compiled by the council for 1891 do not agree with those that appear in the census reports, however which gave a population of 47,988 for the area.</p>\\n<p><b>Stoke Newington St Mary's with South Hornsey 1801-1900</b></p>\\n<h3>Metropolitan borough</h3>\\n<p>The area of the parish of Stoke Newington was 639 acres (2.6\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) in 1891. Following the addition of most of South Hornsey and the boundary adjustments with Hackney and Islington, the area of the borough in 1901 was 863 acres (3.5\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>). The populations recorded in National Censuses were:</p>\\n<p><b>Metropolitan Borough 1900-1961</b></p>\\n<h2>Politics</h2>\\n\\n<h3>Borough council</h3>\\n<p>The borough council consisted of 30 councillors and 5 aldermen. In 1900 the boundary commissioners divided the borough into six wards for the election of councillors:<br></p>\\n<p>The first council elected consisted entirely of \\\"Non-Party\\\" candidates, although <i>The Times</i> noted that they were \\\"Conservative in character\\\". The entire council continued to be described as Independent or Non-Party until the 1934 election when the Labour Party gained 13 seats to the Independents' 17. Labour gained control of the council in 1945, taking all of the seats on the council. The Conservative Party first ran in the 1949 election, winning control from Labour by 23 seats to 7.</p>\\n<p>The wards of the borough were redrawn in 1953, with the area divided into ten wards, each electing three councillors. This reflected the change in settlement in the area, in particular the construction of new estates of council flats, including the London County Council's large Woodberry Down development which housed about a seventh of the borough's population. The names of the wards, a number of which were named after famous residents of Stoke Newington, were as follows:</p>\\n<p>Labour regained power at the 1953 election with 24 seats to 6 Conservatives. They held control at subsequent elections, taking all the seats in 1959. The final election of the council on 10 May 1962 saw four Liberal Party councillors elected to form an opposition group to the 26 Labour members.</p>\\n<h3>Parliamentary constituency</h3>\\n<p>Until 1918 the area formed part of the constituency of Hackney North. In 1918 a new constituency of Stoke Newington identical with the metropolitan borough was created. Due to loss of population, the two constituencies were merged in 1950 as Hackney North and Stoke Newington.</p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>London Government Act 1899</li>\\n<li>Metropolis Management Act 1855</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n\\n<h2><cite>Further reading</cite></h2>\\n<ul><li><cite>Robert Donald, ed.

You could just squeeze three people into the control booth! The tape deck was a Brenell 1\\u00a0inch 8 track. The monitors and desk were custom made, and they had a pair of Auratones as well, fed from Quad power amps. The desk was quite small, pushed hard against the front wall with the custom monitors hung above and the Auratones on the meter bridge.

A total of 196,843 burials had taken place there as of the year 2000. It is a Local Nature Reserve.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Location</h2>\\n<p>The official address of Abney Park is Stoke Newington High Street, N16. The main gate is at the junction of this street and Rectory Road, with a smaller gate on Stoke Newington Church Street. The park lies within the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<h2>Past and present</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1840, Abney Park opened as a model garden cemetery, a pioneering non-denominational place of rest. Its approach was based on the Congregational church's role in the London Missionary Society (LMS), whose fundamental principle was to develop a wholly non-denominational exemplar. It also drew on American burial ideas, specifically Mount Auburn in Massachusetts. Details of the Abney Park Cemetery Company can be found in the diaries of William Copeland Astbury (volumes covering 1831\\u201348)</p>\\n<p>At first there were many links between Abney Park Cemetery and the LMS but this nonconformist (and in particular Congregationalist) period came to a close in the early 1880s when a strictly commercial general cemetery company was formed and the land at Abney Park was made over to the new enterprise. Though the park had not been formalised in 1840 as a cemetery through Act of Parliament or consecration, and Church faculty law never applied, burial ground use, had, by the 1880s, already come to predominate over the wider landscape, access and educational objects of its founders.</p>\\n<p>The founders' financial and legal structure, adapted from the model developed for garden cemeteries in the America by City solicitor George Collison, aimed to establish a joint stock corporation managed by trustees. The trustees would be appointed by the members (those buying plots). Under the trust deed, the founders sought to preserve the park in perpetuity. The weakness of the model lay in the detail however, but this was not evident for thirty years. An eventual successful prosecution by the Crown, ruled that despite their unusual business model and the way in which plots were seemingly sold as freehold land, the legal arrangements were actually inadequate to achieve a different status from any other commercial cemetery, either for the company or the registered keepers of plots. In consequence, company income could not be held in trust for the park, but was to be treated as for any other commercial profit-making company and taxed accordingly.</p>\\n<p>Eventually sold on the open market to a wholly commercially-minded general cemetery company in the 1880s, established with a similar name, three new cemeteries were founded in London's suburbs or nearby countryside. From then onwards standardised park-like landscaping principles came to be applied at Abney Park, replacing much of the unique arboretum planting. Air pollution also took its toll, affecting the conifer walks. After the First World War, path infill began to be practised; a situation that became severe in the 1950s and was continued into the 1970s, when the commercial cemetery company went into liquidation.</p>\\n<p>In 1978, apart from one forecourt building, the park passed to the local council as a burial ground and open space subject to the Local Authorities Cemeteries Order of 1977. For the next twenty-one years, there being only a small number of residual burial and monuments rights, the Council worked with local groups and relatives to accommodate these rights, and exercise discretion to allow occasional courtesy burials, where families had previously held deeds from the cemetery company; but by and large nature was allowed to take its course.</p>\\n<p>Abney Park was included on the Heritage at Risk Register in 2009, as one of Britain's historic parks and gardens at risk from neglect and decay. Although the level of malicious damage is kept low by the conspicuous presence of staff and volunteers of the Abney Park Trust when maintaining the park; by frequent arts and environmental events promoted by the Trust; and by community safety initiatives involving the police and their community support officers; nevertheless, over time it has taken its toll, leading to the current 'at risk' designation. The roof slates and roof flashings of the Abney Park Chapel have been damaged by unauthorised climbing and theft at times when the park was left unsupervised and unlocked overnight, and this has resulted in water seepage into the chapel walls which is now causing serious problems to the whole building. Similarly, from time to time, some sections of boundary wall become too weak due to people climbing over them, and decay has set in. However these matters could be put right and the park is a popular place to visit, with a range of educational, training and cultural events and an annual summer open day. It is a designated Local Nature Reserve and Conservation Area. Apart from the South Lodge extension on the forecourt, Abney Park's freehold is owned by the London Borough of Hackney. The park is situated near Stoke Newington High Street, London N16, and it is leased to the Abney Park Trust. It occupies 12.53 hectares (31.0 acres), which includes a nature reserve, a classroom, a visitor's centre and a central chapel which is disused. The park is normally opened by the Trust for free public access on weekdays and weekends from about 9.30 am to 5 pm, and for access or events agreed with the Trust at all other times.</p>\\n<h2>The Egyptian Revival entrance</h2>\\n<p>One of the \\\"Magnificent Seven\\\" parkland cemeteries created in the early Victorian period, albeit set out in an entirely different way to the others and with somewhat wider purposes, Abney Park features an entrance designed by William Hosking FSA in collaboration with Joseph Bonomi the Younger and the cemetery's founder George Collison II. This frontage was built by John Jay in the then increasingly popular Egyptian Revival style, with hieroglyphics signifying the \\\"Abode of the Mortal Part of Man\\\": a venture too far into the architecture of the African continent for Augustus Pugin, who pilloried the idea, hoping no-one would repeat such a radical departure from \\\"good\\\" Christian gothic design (see illustration for <i>Grounds of a Quaker School</i>). A similar criticism had previously been made when the first Egyptian-style entrance to a western cemetery had been constructed at Mount Auburn Cemetery in the 1830s, on which Abney Park Cemetery was partially modelled. By contrast, figures who appreciated the composition complimented Hosking and Bonomi on their scholarly frontage design; an arbiter of design taste, John Loudon, described it as a \\\"judicious combination of two lodges with gates between\\\".</p>\\n<p>Abney Park has a claim to be the earliest complete design for a permanent \\\"Egyptian Revival\\\" entranceway at a cemetery anywhere in the world. The gateway at Mount Auburn Cemetery, from which it took its inspiration, was at that time still a temporary structure, being made of dusted wood and sand; its permanent design was not built until two years after Abney Park opened. In England there were already some examples of the use of Egyptian Revival architecture on a small scale, including one example of a small gate installed at a cemetery for Nonconformists near Sheffield in 1836. However, Abney Park Cemetery became the first to employ the style for cemetery buildings, and also the first to introduce it for a complete entrance design.</p>\\n\\n<p>At Abney Park the use of motifs not associated with contemporary faith served a profound purpose, since it was consciously opened as the first wholly nondenominational garden cemetery in Europe. True, other garden cemeteries sometimes used the term loosely, meaning only that they had laid out more than one denominational area or built more than one chapel. Abney Park Cemetery was the first to be laid out with \\\"no invidious dividing lines\\\" separating the burial areas of one faith or religious group from any other, and even its one chapel, the Abney Park Chapel, a feast of <i>Puritan</i> or northern European brick gothic yet with ample stone dressings and a little neoclassical design woven into its early Dissenting Gothic design style, had but one central chamber for the common use of all, and but one entrance. As such it was the first nondenominational cemetery chapel in Europe. William Hosking, in being handed the task of achieving this vision, became the first architect to design a nondenominational cemetery chapel in Europe. Underpinning this was a unique legal basis in comparison with the other garden cemeteries of its period; Abney Park was not set aside solely for cemetery use by Act of Parliament, and was not formally consecrated as burial land. Perhaps more so than any other it was entitled to be considered as a park as well as a cemetery.</p>\\n<p>Today it is accommodating this wide role again; burial rights ceased when the private company closed in 1978, enabling the park to now facilitate a wide range of projects in the arts, education, nature conservation and walking/recreation, besides offering new memorial trees and benches where ashes are scattered, and the occasional discretionary or courtesy burial.</p>\\n<h2>Landscape</h2>\\n\\n<p>Abney Park was unique in being the first arboretum to be combined with a cemetery in Europe; offering an educational attraction that was originally set in a landscape of fields and woods, some distance from the built-up boundary of London. Its 2,500 trees and shrubs were all labelled, and arranged around the perimeter alphabetically, from A for <i>Acer</i> (maple trees) to Z for <i>Zanthoxylum</i> (American toothache trees).</p>\\n<p>The emphasis on an educational landscape, as opposed to a purely aesthetic, visually attractive picturesque, drew partly on a simplified version of John Loudon's 'Gardenesque' concept, and applied something akin to this, but with a unique alphabetical approach, and no structural mounding, to a picturesque cemetery design. It was much admired by John Loudon, who described Abney Park Cemetery as \\\"the most highly ornamented cemetery in the vicinity of London\\\", albeit that he favoured a more formal and classical approach to garden cemetery design as a general rule and, in 1843 developed design principles for such an approach.</p>\\n<p>At the Stoke Newington cemetery the botanical planting was carefully sited since the design sought to do as little as possible to change the existing picturesque parkland. This careful approach drew on that used at Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston where Dearborn had emphasised the compatibility of horticulture and even an experimental garden with a cemetery, leading to the opening of a cemetery supported by the Massachusetts Horticultural Society; one that succeeded in establishing a picturesque landscape coupled with botanical garden specimens and an adjoining scientific garden. There were important differences, however; the New England cemetery had benefited from a more sylvan setting than that of Abney Park, and a much larger estate. Nonetheless, the ties were evident. The founding directors of the Abney Park project were all Congregationalists, who together with other nonconformists had strong links with their brethren in the new world, to where they had emigrated in search of religious freedom. George Collison, Abney Park Cemetery's company secretary, and the key force behind its radical design, recorded his visit to, and impressions of, Mount Auburn Cemetery, in a book published to coincide with the opening of the Stoke Newington cemetery. It also contains a complete list of all the arboretum species and varieties planted at Abney Park.</p>\\n<p>The concept of the arboretum -and indeed also a rosarium \\u2013 was inspired by George Loddiges FLS FZS, a local Hackney nurseryman who became a small shareholder in the cemetery company and was appointed to lead its landscape design, planting and educational labelling, to complement William Hosking's layout and building and engineering (drainage) scheme. The pair worked closely as a design team under the guiding influence of the third designer George Collison, who represented the client company both as its solicitor and principal learned visionary. Loddiges' earlier experience in designing an A to Z arboretum at his Mare Street nursery, and possession of one of the largest ranges of trees and shrubs then grown for sale in Britain, ensured success.</p>\\n<p>The overall effect was to establish Abney Park as the most impressively landscaped garden cemetery of its period. However regrettably, Loddiges Nursery closed in the early 1850s and thereafter maintenance of the trees and shrubs and of their botanical labels, was impaired. Today Loddiges' work is of unparalleled significance to landscape design, being recognised as of European importance. Abney Park was the first London cemetery to be invited to join the Association of Significant Cemeteries in Europe (ASCE) and it is the only surviving example of an English landscape designed by George Loddiges FLS FZS.</p>\\n<h2>The <i>Campo Santo</i> of the Dissenters</h2>\\n\\n<p>Such an elaborate planting scheme for a park cemetery may also be a reflection of the symbolic importance the founding directors attached to the land that formed Abney Park Cemetery. As nonconformists, who treasured the independence of their religious beliefs\\u2014and therefore practised Christianity outside of the established Church of England\\u2014they held the land <i>itself</i> to be of immense significance, for it had previously been two neighbouring and inter-related 18th-century parkland estates, the grounds of Abney House and Fleetwood House, where the non-conformist Doctor of Divinity, educationalist and poet Dr. Isaac Watts lived and taught, and indeed wrote several of his popular books and hymns.</p>\\n<p>Due to these religious associations, Abney Park Cemetery rapidly became the most attractive Victorian resting place for nonconformist or dissenting ministers and educationalists, principally those from a Protestant dissenting tradition. Indeed it stands today as the most important burial place in the UK of 19th-century Congregational, Baptist, Methodist and Salvation Army ministers and educationalists, including Christopher Newman Hall and many others, some of whom are mentioned below. Whereas Bunhill Fields was described by the poet Robert Southey as \\\"the <i>Campo Santo</i> of the Dissenters\\\" (a reference to the monumental cemetery of that name in Pisa, Italy \\u2013 <i>campo santo</i> translates as \\\"sacred field\\\" or \\\"saints' abode\\\" ) in respect of its late 17th- and 18th-century burials, Abney Park took on the mantle during the Victorian period in the writings of E. Paxton Hood for the Religious Tract Society.</p>\\n<p>Though it primarily attracted Congregational, Methodist and Salvation Army nonconformists, rather than certain other nonconformists such as Quakers, or non-Protestant nonconformists such as Catholics or Jewish people, Abney Park Cemetery more than any other 19th-century cemetery was open to the burial of all regardless of their religious convictions or leanings. Whilst its founding directors were all Congregationalists and they were concerned to find a place for such burials, they expressly established the Stoke Newington cemetery as the first fully nondenominational cemetery in Europe (where anyone could be buried anywhere). Selection of a site with historical associations with Dr Isaac Watts served this purpose well, for he had been honoured in death with a bust in the Anglican Westminster Abbey to complement his burial at the Independent's Bunhill Fields. Subsequently his hymns and scholarly works had become widely used and referred to by many denominations, such that in the 19th century the Rev. John Stroughton could write: \\\"Dr. Watts was as far removed from sectarianism as a man could be\\\". Abney Park Chapel, sometimes referred to informally as Dr Watts' Chapel, became its spiritual and landscape focal point. It sits in the heart of the cemetery; its axial walk to Church Street, called Dr Watts' Walk, was chosen in 1845 as the most appropriate site in London for a public statue to the great man, sculpted by Edward Hodges Baily, RA FRS.</p>\\n<h2>Educational establishments</h2>\\n<p>Besides its religious associations, Abney Park has a strong educational pedigree. For example, its prominent director in the mid-to-late Victorian era, Charles Reed, was also the Chairman of the London School Board and Hackney's first MP. In fact, this part of north London, particularly Newington Green, had a long history of innovative education for boys and young men, known as dissenting academies.</p>\\n<p>Abney House was the first premises in England to be used exclusively as a Wesleyan training college, from c. 1838. This followed use of temporary, shared facilities in Hackney, and prior to the building of their own spacious colleges and grounds, one in the north of England, and a second at Richmond Hill, to which the college at Abney Park moved in 1843. Abney House was then demolished. The governorship of the seminary was held by Rev. John Farrar, Secretary of the Methodist Conference on fourteen occasions and twice its elected President.</p>\\n<p>Next to Abney House on Church Street was Fleetwood House, used as the base for Newington Academy for Girls, which was founded in 1824 by, among others, the Quaker scientist and abolitionist William Allen and run in a most enlightened and imaginative way by Susanna Corder, who later emigrated for a while to Boston and emerged as a talented biographer. It lost exclusive use of attractive grounds in the eastern part of Abney Park on formation of the cemetery, leaving only the school house and a small garden for the private use of the students. However, they were welcome to use the new cemetery's educational arboretum and this, along with Abney Park as a whole, was rarely shared with many others in the early years of the new cemetery, except at weekends. The school's innovative approach included transport arrangements; it commissioned the first school bus in the world.</p>\\n<h2>Famous people: burials and associations in the park</h2>\\n\\n<p>Most notably, William and Catherine Booth, founders of The Salvation Army, are buried in a prominent location close to Church Street and next to their son Bramwell Booth and various SA commissioners, including Elijah Cadman, John Lawley, William Ridsdel, Frederick Booth-Tucker, George Scott Railton, the Army's first Commissioner, Theodore Kitching and T. Henry Howard, its Chief of Staff.</p>\\n<p>Earlier in the 19th century, one of the hottest issues for political and social reform was the abolition of slavery, and Stoke Newington and the Quakers, separately and together, played a prominent role in this. Indeed, William Wilberforce himself planned to be buried in the village at St Mary's Church with his sister, his will being overturned on his death since parliament considered a state funeral at Westminster Abbey more fitting. Wilberforce's son-in-law, the abolitionist lawyer James Stephen, was also a frequent visitor, as his father lived at the Fleetwood Summerhouse adjacent to Abney Park. Dr Thomas Binney, the \\\"Archbishop of Non-conformity\\\", has a portrait in the National Portrait Gallery that shows him at the Anti-Slavery Society Convention (with Josiah Conder); Binney is buried close to the Church Street entrance in Abney Park Cemetery. Christopher Newman Hall, who was influential on the side of slavery emancipation in the American Civil War, is buried here with his father. So is the Rev. James Sherman, who wrote the introduction to Harriet Beecher Stowe's hugely influential <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>. The novel was partly based on Josiah Henson, whose escape to freedom in Britain was assisted by the philanthropist Samuel Morley, who is buried in the cemetery. The Rev. Joseph Ketley, a Congregational missionary and abolitionist in Demerara, is also interred here, as is Rev. Dr John Morison, patron of the escaped slave and influential African-American autobiographer Moses Roper.</p>\\n\\n<p>Recently rediscovered is the grave of Olaudah Equiano's daughter Joanna Vassa, as he was a well-known former slave who worked for abolition. Jamaican emancipation is represented directly by the Rev. Samuel Oughton and the Rev. Thomas Burchell, who only narrowly escaped death at the hands of the planters; and their underlying Baptist support by Nathaniel Rogers M.D. A deacon at the Burchell Baptist church, the African Samuel Sharpe, became a Jamaican hero. Aaron Buzacott, the second Secretary of Anti-Slavery International, originally known as the Anti-Slavery Society, is buried here. At Abney Park Cemetery there are also some of the early settlers in Britain from the four corners of the world, such as the African, Thomas Caulker, the son of the King of Bompey (now Sierra Leone), who signed an anti-slavery agreement that became part of an Act of Parliament in the 1850s; and Leota, a native of the Samoa Islands whose life in London was due to the work of the London Missionary Society who sought to build schools and bring scripture to the inhabitants of the South Seas. Abney Park is one of the main burial places of 19th-century missionaries; here, for example is the burial place of William Ellis, John Williams' wife and son, Dr Walter Henry Medhurst, and Edward Stallybrass. Also Sarah Buzacott, the wife of Aaron Buzacott the elder, who was a teacher at the London Missionary Society college at Rarotonga in the South Seas. Many nonconformist divines are also buried here, for example Dr Alexander Fletcher, 'The Children's Friend'.</p>\\n<p>The evangelist Emily Gosse is buried in a simple grave near Dr Watts' Mound. Close to Church Street is the burial of one of the cemetery's early Director and Trustees, one of the first two members of parliament for Hackney Sir Charles Reed FSA. Close by lies his father Dr Andrew Reed (1788\\u20131862), a student of Rev. George Collison and founder of the London Orphan Asylum. In 1834, along with the Rev. J. Matheson, Andrew Reed was sent to the Congregational Churches of America by the Congregational Union of England and Wales as a deputation to promote peace and friendship between the two communities. He spent six months in America and during his stay there Yale University conferred upon him an honorary Doctorate of Divinity. This strengthened the Congregationalists' transatlantic links, ensuring the Rev George Collison's son a welcome when he visited to gain ideas for Abney Park cemetery's design from Mount Auburn Cemetery.</p>\\n<p>Here too is the Welsh MP Henry Richard, a mid-19th-century secretary of the Peace Society, instrumental in encouraging the first university in Wales at Aberystwyth along with its founder Sir Hugh Owen, whose own memorial is to the east of the Abney Park Cedar Circle. Also buried here is Betsi Cadwaladr, a Welsh nurse who worked in the Crimea with Florence Nightingale. The Peace Society is well represented at Abney Park; two of its other 19th-century secretaries, Rev. Nun Morgan Harry and Rev. John Jefferson are also buried here. Rajendra Chandra Chandra, Professor of Calcutta Medical College and physician, is also buried here with his wife.</p>\\n<p>Pioneering fire fighter James Braidwood, credited with forming the first municipal fire brigade; Edward Calvert, painter; engraver and painter and novelist Isabella Banks; newspaper editor and playwright George Linnaeus Banks; and the African-Jamaican Baptist missionary Rev. Joseph Jackson Fuller, are also buried in the Park. So too are Rev William Brock D.D., John Hoppus D.D. of University College London, and John Harris D.D. and Robert Halley of New College London.</p>\\n<p>Amongst the theatre and music hall performers resting at Abney Park are George Leybourne, Nelly Power, Albert Chevalier, G. W. Hunt, Herbert Campbell, Edmund Payne, Dan Crawley, Walter Laburnum and Fred Albert. These graves are cared for by the theatre charity The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America who undertake memorial restorations and provide free monthly guided walks. </p>\\n<p>Other burials at the cemetery include the Chartist leader and publisher James \\\"Bronterre\\\" O'Brien, whose life and work is celebrated at the cemetery each year, especially by the Irish community and those in the Labour Movement; Dr John Pye Smith, the first dissenter to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society; Mary Hays, the feminist writer and friend of Mary Wollstonecraft; Eric Walrond, the African-American Harlem Renaissance writer; and Thomas William Robertson the dramatic author. John O'Connor Power (1846\\u20131919), Irish Member of Parliament for Mayo, orator, barrister, radical journalist and author of <i>The Making of an Orator</i> is buried here with his wife's family. A Victoria Cross recipient from the Indian Mutiny, Private John Freeman, is buried here. World record holder in motor-paced cycling Tommy Hall.</p>\\n<p>In a different way, Susanna Bostock is remembered, largely due to the dominance of her life-sized marble lion alongside a path close to the chapel. Along with the Wombwells, the Bostocks were mainly responsible for bringing Asian and African animals to the attention of the Victorian public. For part of the year giraffes lived close to the cemetery at a small farm in Yoakley Road.</p>\\n<h2>First &amp; Second World Wars</h2>\\n\\n<p>Abney Park contains war graves to 371 Commonwealth service personnel who died in the two World Wars and which are registered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission: 258 from World War I and 113 from World War II. Unusually, Stoke Newington has two \\\"Cross of Sacrifice\\\" monuments constructed shortly after the end of WWI based on Blomfield's famous design: one on the lawn in front of St. Mary's Church on Church Street, and one in front of the south-facing facade of Abney Park Chapel in the cemetery. The names associated with the first cross are displayed a short distance away (inside the foyer of the public library on Church Street) whilst the names of those associated with the second cross (those who are interred in the cemetery but whose graves could not be given individual headstones) are recorded on a north-facing Screen Wall memorial added to the platform on which it stands. Near the cemetery cross, the names of Second World War servicemen who lost their lives and have been buried in the cemetery without separate commemoration, have also been displayed.</p>\\n<p>The cemetery's 'Cross of Sacrifice' serves as a landmark, but though rising on a ragstone platform of contrasting Portland Stone, it cannot be viewed on the approach from Church Street since the cemetery company chose to infill Dr Watts' axial walk at the time the war memorial was erected, so they designed the platform screen wall to prevent the cross from being seen from the south. The Trust hopes to change this if a redesign can be agreed, so as to display the cross to be seen from more directions and as a vantage point and focal point overlooking both directions of the original axis from the chapel spire and its ogee arch along Dr Watts' Walk, and on to Abney House gate; the axis that commemorates the life of the Rev. Dr Isaac Watts. Slightly off this exact axial alignment, is the small Blitz memorial that records civilian deaths, closer to the south entrance (picture right).</p>\\n<p>Though it suffered extensive property damage in the war, Stoke Newington's death toll was relatively low by the standards of some other Hackney districts like Shoreditch, and it would have been lower still, were it not for one incident on 13 October 1940, when a German bomb made a direct hit on a crowded shelter at Coronation Avenue, just off the high street. Most people in the shelter were killed, and as the illustration shows, the list of the dead from this one incident takes up nearly three of the four panels on the memorial. Many of the dead were Jewish and some were refugees from the Nazis.</p>\\n<p>Of two known unexploded WWII bombs remaining in Stoke Newington, one is located somewhere in Abney Park.</p>\\n<h2>'Sweet Auburn' &amp; woodland wildlife</h2>\\n<p>As may have been implied already, Abney Park Cemetery was the only garden cemetery of its era to be influenced by New World cemetery design ideas due to the strong links between its founders and New England; in particular Boston. The Stoke Newington cemetery reflects the design style adopted for Mount Auburn, for example in its use of an Egyptian Revival entrance and arboretum. However, though its \\\"model\\\" lay in the New World, it drew on different romantic landscape associations. Whereas Mount Auburn Cemetery celebrated the 'Sweet Auburn' of poetry, in particular the nature and woodland associated with the Auburn village area, it was the \\\"romance\\\" of religious and historical associations that primarily attracted the founders of London's first nondenominational garden cemetery, to Lady Mary Abney's estate which had served as an inspiration to the celebrated Isaac Watts. Nonetheless, on its opening, Abney Park was by far the most sylvan of all garden cemeteries in Britain; its many stately trees imbued the landscape with a uniquely well-timbered inheritance or \\\"green cloak\\\", and plans were put in train to encourage this further with collections of trees arranged along, and set back from, path edges. Whereas the cemetery at Mount Auburn had been blessed with a natural woodland setting, well suited to its founders' ethos of creating an Elysian paradise, Abney Park would take some time to more closely reflect its predominantly woodland style of cemetery design and a more transcendental view of nature as proposed by Emerson, and Thoreau in New England.</p>\\n\\n<p>Slowly, however, time has healed this difference and the landscape at Abney Park has grown closer to its New World cousin. Mature trees and woodland now adorn Abney Park, completing its transformation into a woodland cemetery. This has been so profound a change that by the early 1990s the cemetery was acknowledged to be the largest woodland ecosystem in North London so close to the centre of the City of London, and became designated as the first statutory Local Nature Reserve in the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>Under careful management the woodland is slowly becoming enriched through natural regeneration. The northern areas are slowly returning to native oaks with a hornbeam and hawthorn understory, and a woodland ground flora that includes Wood False Brome grass and Wood Spurge; the whole being interspersed with naturalising exotic thorns and service trees to add a cross-cultural dimension. Meanwhile, the sandy brickearth soils that extend from Church Street along Dr Watts' Walk to the chapel lawns, the sole surviving heathland in Hackney, are returning to a lighter structure based on Silver Birch woodland and healthy species such as bracken fern. Today, a range of woodland birds, mammals and butterflies are supported; the grounds forming one of north London's largest breeding sites so close to the City for some very attractive species such as the Speckled Wood butterfly.</p>\\n<p>Nature changes gradually however, and the ecology will need active habitat management if these semi-natural sylvan qualities are to be preserved and enhanced, and to ensure that the naturalising exotic arboretum trees (such as Various-leaved Hawthorn and Service Tree of Fontainebleau) and plans for the replacement of Loddiges' perimeter A to Z arboretum, contribute their valuable educational and botanical interest to parts of the grounds.</p>\\n<h2>Endpiece</h2>\\n<p>Part of a Victorian account of a visit to admire the beauties of Abney Park Cemetery reads:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<p>There is a beautiful cemetery in Stoke Newington, and it was given to the inhabitants in memory of Lady Abney, who was a sincere friend to Dr. Watts. There is in it a pretty little church, where funeral services are performed by all denominations of Christians.</p>\\n<p>Lady Abney was very liberal in her religious views, and the cemetery is, with its church, open to all alike, and though its grounds were never consecrated, yet many rigid churchmen have been buried in it. There is no quieter burial spot within a dozen miles of London in any direction, and there are cedars of Lebanon in it, wide lawns, and beautiful flowers.</p>\\n<p>There is an old clergyman in the church, who is always ready to officiate for a small fee on funeral occasions. He is over eighty years old, his hair is like the snow, and he is a fit companion to such a solemn place.</p>\\n<p>One shining evening, with a female friend we visited the cemetery, and stopped in the little [largely] Gothic chapel to talk with the venerable clergyman. The tears actually sprung over his eyelids when we said that we came from America.</p>\\n<p>The old man asked a thousand questions about the wonderful far land of liberty in the west, which we were glad to answer. Almost every family among the poor respectable classes in England, has some member, or relation in America.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Gallery</h2>\\n<p>Abney Park Cemetery is one of the Magnificent Seven.

It is a 13ha (32 acre) park dating from just before 1700, named after Lady Mary Abney and associated with Dr Isaac Watts. In the early 18th century, the park was accessed via the frontages and gardens of two large mansions \\u2014 her own manor house (Abney House), and the neighbouring Fleetwood House. Both mansions fronted onto Church Street in what was then a quiet Nonconformist village.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Parkland</h2>\\n<p>In the early 18th century, Lady Mary Abney laid out Abney Park after inheriting the Manor of Stoke Newington in 1701 from her brother Thomas Gunston. Initially she and her husband Sir Thomas Abney lived there part-time, also living at his residence in Hertfordshire. She began work on the park in those years.</p>\\n<p>After her husband's death in 1722, Lady Mary moved to Abney House full-time, becoming the first Lady of the Manor of Stoke Newington in her own right. She was said to be helped in designing the landscaping of the grounds as an English garden by the learned Dr Isaac Watts, who had been a long-term house guest of her and her late husband, and continued to live in her household. The neighbouring Hartopp family of Fleetwood House, who leased the eastern part of the park to Lady Mary, also helped with the park.</p>\\n<p>Her improvements included planting of the Great Elm Walk and Little Elm Walk, which established shady walkways down to the island heronry of the Hackney Brook at the bottom of the park. Both Wych Elm and English Elm were planted. The Hartopp family had already completed one of the early plantings of a Cedar of Lebanon tree in Great Britain, adjacent to an ornamental pond. This tree survived into the 1920s and is illustrated in many engravings of the period.</p>\\n<p>Other trees planted at an early date at Abney Park (either in the portion leased by Fleetwood House, or that attached solely to Abney House) included American Larch and Tulip Trees from the New World. The Nonconformists of Stoke Newington had strong connections to colonists in New England.</p>\\n<h2>Abney House</h2>\\n<p>Abney Park was dominated by Abney House. For some time in the early decades of the 19th century, it was the residence of James William Freshfield and his family.</p>\\n<p>In its final years, it was adapted for use as a Wesleyan Methodist training college or seminary (c.1838/9-1843). Rev. John Farrar was the governor of the college. He was elected Secretary of the Methodist Conference on fourteen occasions and twice its President. When the Methodists moved into their first purpose-built college at Richmond, south of London in 1843, Farrar was appointed as the Classical Tutor. He worked there until 1857.</p>\\n<p>After 1843, Abney House was 'recycled' (broken up for sale as building materials) for the building trade of the rapidly expanding metropolis, as was common in the Victorian era.</p>\\n<h2>Fleetwood House</h2>\\n<p>Fleetwood House was built in the 1630s for Sir Edward Hartopp. By marriage the estate passed to Charles Fleetwood, one of Oliver Cromwell's generals, and was named for him. It was later owned by various parties. from whom it got its name, and then through various parties. It served as a meeting place for Dissenters and Nonconformists, for which residents Stoke Newington was known.</p>\\n<p>In the grounds was a third building, called the Summerhouse. From 1774, it was used as a summer residence by the family of young James Stephen (1758-1832). Although not a Quaker, he became closely with the abolitionist cause, which they supported. In 1800, he married a sister of his friend William Wilberforce, who visited Stoke Newington regularly. Between them, the two men drafted the Slave Trade Act 1807, to prohibit the international slave trade originating in Africa.</p>\\n<p>In 1824, Fleetwood House was adapted for use as a new Quaker school, known as Newington Academy for Girls (also Newington College for Girls). In a time when girls' educational opportunities were limited, it offered a wide range of subjects (including sciences) \\\"on a plan in degree differing from any hitherto adopted\\\", according to the prospectus. It commissioned the world's first school bus, designed by George Shillibeer.</p>\\n<p>One of the school's founders was William Allen, a Quaker active with the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. His marriage to Grizell Hoare was the subject of a satirical cartoon, in which the school is referred to as the Newington Nunnery. Joseph Pease, later the first Quaker MP, wrote a doggerel verse praising Allen's marriage.</p>\\n<p>Fleetwood House was demolished in 1872. A fire station was constructed on the site.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Sources</h2>\\n<ul><li>Shirren, A.J.

It was incorporated into the Lee Valley Park in 1967. It was originally a true marsh, but was extensively drained from Medieval times, and rubble was dumped here from buildings damaged by air raids during World War II.</p>\\n<p>The principal area of the marsh lies below Lea Bridge Road between the Old River Lea, and the Hackney Cut \\u2013 an artificial channel of the Lee Navigation, dug about 1770, to avoid a loop in the natural watercourse. The southern extent is marked by the A12; although the industrial land around Hackney Wick Stadium was originally an extension of the marsh, it now forms a part of the Olympic Park for the 2012 Summer Olympics.</p>\\n<p>Hackney Marsh is one of the largest areas of common land in Greater London, with 136.01 hectares (336.1 acres) of protected commons.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>The marsh</h3>\\n<p>The River itself was always an important waterway, being navigable to Hertfordshire; the Marsh was formed by the periodic flooding of the river, and so formed useful pasture, but could not be occupied permanently. Before the 10th century, the estuary of the river came as far as Hackney Wick, crossed at Old Ford. Marsh Road, the continuation of Homerton High Street, led to the marshes, and thence to Temple Mills. The Romans appear to have built a significant stone causeway across the marshes here; a periodical, the <i>Ambulator</i> of 1774, noted</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><i>there have been discovered within the last few years the remains of a great causeway of stone, which, by the Roman coins found there, would appear to have been one of the famous highways made by the Romans</i></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The river forms a natural boundary, so in 527\\u00a0AD it formed the boundary between the Saxon kingdoms of Essex and Middlesex. In the 9th century, it formed a part of the Danelaw boundary and reputedly, King Alfred stranded an invading Viking fleet here in 895\\u00a0AD. This was achieved by draining the river where it met the River Thames, but the increased drainage affected river navigability, until it was restored in the 17th century.</p>\\n<p>By medieval times, both sides had become counties in England, and attempts were made to control the flow of water through the marshes. Mills were established including the Knights Templar mill at Temple Mills. Much of the marsh was 'owned' by the Templars and used for pasture. When the Templars were abolished, the land passed to the Knights Hospitaller, and thence to the Crown during the Reformation, when monastic lands were seized. At this time, much of the land was associated with the Hackney village of Lower Homerton and with the large manor house at Hackney Wick.</p>\\n<p>Around 1770, the river was straightened by the construction of the Hackney Cut, now forming the eastern extent of the marsh. The natural watercourse passes to the east over the Middlesex Filter Beds Weir, just below Lea Bridge Road. A nature reserve occupies the former Middlesex Filter beds on the island between the two watercourses.</p>\\n<p>By 1795, the former Templar mills were being used for preparing lead (submerged in urine, and heated by decaying cow dung, the lead was converted to lead oxide, and then finely ground to form a pigment for white, yellow and red lead paint). A new watermill was established on the Crown land of the marshes by Prince Rupert for an improved method of boring guns, however the secret died with him in 1682 and the enterprise collapsed.</p>\\n<p>At the end of the 19th century Hackney suffered from increased demand for building land, both for housing and to extend the factories in Homerton. The marshes had always suffered periodic flooding from the Lea but with the introduction of mains sewerage a flood relief sewer was constructed beneath the marshes. Most common and Lammas lands were then preserved by an Act of Parliament and passed to the control of the Metropolitan Board of Works, but the marsh remained excluded from the MBW scheme because many of the lammas rights were still exercised, predominantly grazing. This was a period of increasing arguments between landowners and groups, such as the Eton Manor Mission, who were trying to use the marsh for recreation. The 337 acres (1.36\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) of marshes were finally preserved by the London County Council in 1890, by purchasing the rights and landowners' interests for \\u00a375,000. They opened to the public in 1893 and were formally dedicated in 1894. The LCC undertook further flood prevention, straightening some of the bends in the River by introducing four 'cuts', the old channels being retained to form islands.</p>\\n\\n<p>There were few houses on the marshes, but a notable exception was the White House Inn, by a bridge on the old road to Leyton. Originally built as part of a Lea fishery scheme, the pub is now long gone but a bridge remains, rebuilt to supply anti-aircraft batteries during World War II.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><i>In the Marshes towards Hackney Wick were low public houses, the haunt of highwaymen and their Dulcineas. Dick Turpin was a constant guest at the \\\"White House,\\\" or \\\"Tyler's Ferry,\\\" near Joe Sowter's cock-pit at Temple Mills; and few police-officers were bold enough to approach the spot</i>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Small areas of the marsh have been taken for housing and sports fields and others added. 35.5 acres (144,000\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>) were taken in 1915 to build the 'National Projectile Factory'; after World War I, in 1922 this site was used to create the Mabley Green recreation ground. A further 22.5 acres (91,000\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>) were taken in 1937 for the building of the Kingsmead Estate. The Lesney die cast model factory was built on the Homerton side of the Lee Navigation in the 1940s, having success for many years with their <i>Matchbox</i> brand. The factory was a major local employer and closed in 1990.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Sport</h3>\\n<p>In 1881, men from Homerton College, then still in the London area, founded the Glyn Cricket Club. Members of the cricket club then decided to form a football section to keep fit during the winter months, this football section was to become the famous Clapton Orient Football Club which for thirty years played its home games at Millfields Road Stadium (1900\\u20131930). In 1946 the Club was renamed Leyton Orient and their home ground is now the Matchroom Stadium in Brisbane Road, Leyton, E10 5NF. Today the marshes provide many pleasant walks, in reach of the inner city, but the most famous use of Hackney Marshes is for Sunday league football, with 88 full-size football pitches marked out. On a typical Sunday, over 100 matches are played by amateur teams in several local leagues. This led in 2006 to a dispute between the London Borough of Hackney and Nike, Inc. over the company's use of the borough logo on their sportswear. The dispute was settled with payment of \\u00a3300,000 going to support local youth sports groups.</p>\\n<p>One of the most well known matches to be played on the marshes is games from The Hackney &amp; Leyton League</p>\\n<h3>London Olympics 2012</h3>\\n\\n<p>Part of the London Olympic park for the Summer Olympics of 2012 was built on Hackney Marshes. This caused some controversy with local residents' groups, who expressed concerns that East Marsh was to be tarmacked and used as a disabled coach park for the games. This was a temporary measure and restoration of the pitches has commenced -although it is behind schedule and unlikely to open in time for the start of the 2013 football season.</p>\\n<p>Arena Fields, however, was lost to the Olympic Park and its site will become part of the legacy Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park permanently. This area is to be replaced by parkland of comparable size and value on the Hackney side at the end of the 2012 Summer Olympics. It will not be possible to reinstate the loss of mature and varied trees or to compensate for the disruption caused to wildlife by construction.</p>\\n<p>The natural course of the River Lea forms the borough boundary with Waltham Forest and Newham (except for East Marsh, which lies between the river and Temple Mills). The Olympic plans included upgrading this watercourse and improving public access. The Olympic Park lies south of the A12, on industrial land around the former Hackney Stadium.</p>\\n<h2>Music, literature and film</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>The celebrated cockney music hall performer Gus Elen sang a song entitled <i>If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses In Between</i> which included the following chorus:</li>\\n</ul><blockquote>\\n<p><i>Oh it really is a wery pretty garden<br>\\nAnd Chingford to the eastward could be seen;<br>\\n'Wiv a ladder and some glasses,<br>\\nYou could see to 'Ackney Marshes,<br>\\nIf it wasn't for the 'ouses in between.</i></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<ul><li>In 1977, a 15 minute film was made celebrating the football on the marshes, by John Smith, and adapted for television the following year.</li>\\n<li>In 1997, Nike presented a selection of Premiership players turning out for the Sunday League teams to the soundtrack of Blur's \\\"Parklife\\\".</li>\\n<li>The 2005 film <i>Bullet Boy</i> (Saul Dibb) used the marshes and local streets as a location.</li>\\n<li>Radio 1's Hackney Weekend was held here on the marshes on 23 and 24 June 2012. with acts such as Jay-Z, Rihanna, will.i.am, Florence + The Machine, Leona Lewis and Plan B all performing across the two days.</li>\\n</ul><h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Transport and locale</h2>\\n<h3>Railway stations</h3>\\n<p>The area is not well served by transport, although boasts many buses.

Much of Hackney maintains its inner-city character and in places like Dalston large housing estates now sit side-by-side with gated communities. In South Hackney, near Victoria Park, there is terraced Victorian and Edwardian housing.</p>\\n<p>The historical and administrative heart of Hackney is the area roughly extending north from Mare Street and surrounding the Church of St John-at-Hackney; known as Hackney Central. To the north of the borough are Upper Clapton and Lower Clapton, Stamford Hill and Stoke Newington. To the east is the large open space of Hackney Marshes and the districts of Hackney Wick and Homerton. Light industries in the area around the River Lea employ over 3,000 people and some were also used for the 2012 Summer Olympics.</p>\\n<p>There are 1,300 listed buildings in Hackney, including the iconic Grade II* Hackney Empire, Tudor Sutton House, and the Grade I medieval St Augustine's Tower. The Borough contains 25 conservation areas including Clapton Square, and urban open-spaces including Clapton Common and Clissold Park. Conservation areas also protect large areas of Georgian and Victorian housing, and areas of industrial heritage.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n<p>The borough was formed in 1965 from the area of the earlier metropolitan boroughs of Hackney, Shoreditch and Stoke Newington. The new council included representative symbols of the predecessor boroughs in its new combined coat of arms: Shoreditch by three bells from Shoreditch Church; Stoke Newington by two trees bearing fruit; and Hackney by the Maltese Cross of the principal landowners of the parish in the Middle Ages. The shield is surmounted by a representation of St. Augustine's Tower.</p>\\n<p>The council displays, in Hackney Town Hall, a portrait of the Queen wearing the robes of the Most Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem, of which she is Patron.</p>\\n<p>The borough has a rich history; the Roman road, Ermine Street, forms the western edge of the borough. Most of the rest of the land was covered with open oak and hazel woodlands, with marshland around the rivers and streams that crossed the area. Hackney lay within the Catuvellauni tribal territory. The eastern boundary of the borough is marked by the River Lea. This was an ancient boundary between pre-Roman tribes, and in the Roman era, was tidal up to Hackney Wick and continued to be the boundary between the historic counties of Middlesex and Essex.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the Tudor period the lands of religious orders were seized by the Crown and put up for sale. Thus Hackney became a retreat for the nobility around Hackney Central and Homerton, including Henry VIII's Palace by Lea Bridge roundabout, where BSix Sixth Form College stands today. Sutton House, on Homerton High Street, is the oldest surviving dwelling in Hackney, originally built as <i>Bryck Place</i> for Sir Ralph Sadleir, a diplomat, in 1535. The village of Hackney flourished from the Tudor to late Georgian periods as a rural retreat. The first documented \\\"hackney coach\\\"\\u2014the forerunner of the more generic \\\"hackney carriage\\\"\\u2014operated in London in 1621. Current opinion is that the name \\\"hackney,\\\" to refer to a London taxi, is derived from the village name. (Hackney, through its historical fame for its horses and horse-drawn carriages, is also the root of the Spanish word <i>jaca</i>, a term used for a small breed of horse, and the Sardinian achetta horse.) Hackney's rural reputation brought to an end by the construction of the railway in the 1850s.</p>\\n\\n<p>London's first Tudor theatres were built at Shoreditch and the Gunpowder Plot was first exposed nearby in Hoxton too.</p>\\n<p>Notable residents from the 17th, 18th, and 19th Centuries included Robert Aske, William Cecil, Samuel Courtauld, Samuel Hoare, Joseph Priestley and Thomas Sutton.</p>\\n<p>Many grand houses stood in Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill, with the latter providing a haven for Hackney's many Orthodox Jewish residents from the 1930s. Alfred Hitchcock made many of his first films in Hoxton at the Gainsborough Studios in Poole Street.</p>\\n<p>After industrialisation, extensive post-war development and immigration, the area's many Georgian and Victorian terraces are being gentrified, warehouses are being converted and new apartments are being built. It was inner London's 'greenest borough' and London Transport's 'best bike borough 2006', with 62 parks and open spaces, covering 815 acres (3.3\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>). Seven Hackney parks have now achieved Green Flag status. One, Abney Park, became scheduled in 2009 as one of Britain's historic park and garden at risk from neglect and decay. Hackney Marshes play host to the largest collection of football pitches in Europe; and was the site of part of the 2012 Summer Olympics.</p>\\n<h2>Governance</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>The borough comprises two parliamentary constituencies: Hackney North and Stoke Newington (represented by Diane Abbott MP) and Hackney South and Shoreditch (represented by Meg Hillier MP); both are Privy Counsellors and Labour Party Members of Parliament. The borough is in the North East London Assembly constituency returning Jennette Arnold AM, as the directly elected Assembly Member. Hackney is part of the London constituency in the European Parliament.</p>\\n<p>Unlike most other English local authorities, the Borough is now governed by a directly-elected Mayor who is also the political leader of the Council. The Mayor\\u00a0\\u2013 currently Jules Pipe CBE\\u00a0\\u2013 is supported by a cabinet, councillors and a Speaker who fulfils the civic and ceremonial duties previously undertaken by the (non-political) mayor.</p>\\n<p>At the Hackney Council election on 6 May 2010 the Labour Party were returned with 50 Councillors; winning six additional seats. The Conservative Party forms the largest opposition party on the Council with four Councillors; and the Liberal Democrats have three.</p>\\n<p><i>City's councils get top ratings</i> (BBC News) Every ward remains among the 10% most deprived in the country, with 47% of children living in low income households.</p>\\n<p>Hackney has a reputation as one of the most crime-ridden London boroughs, and some of its streets have even been referred to as \\\"Murder Mile\\\", but cooperation between local police and council has resulted in the borough experiencing a bigger drop in crime than in any other London borough in the four-year period up to 2007 (28% reduction).</p>\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n<h3>Location</h3>\\n<p>The London Borough of Hackney is an Inner London Borough within Greater London. It is to the north-east of the City of London; and neighboured by the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, to the south; Islington to the west at Southgate Road; Haringey to the north. On the east, the River Lea forms the boundary with Waltham Forest; and to the south-east is Newham. Historically, the River Lea formed the boundary between the predecessor counties of Middlesex and Essex.</p>\\n<p>Hackney Town Hall is approximately 5 miles (8\\u00a0km) north-east of Charing Cross, St Pauls Cathedral being situated in between; and 3.8 miles (6.1\\u00a0km) from the GLA City Hall near Tower Bridge.</p>\\n<h3>Districts and postcodes</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>The most southerly district in the borough is Shoreditch, adjacent to the City. To the north-west, bordering Islington, the City, and north of Old Street is Hoxton. To the north of Shoreditch is Haggerston, north of the Regents Canal. Bethnal Green also forms of the southern parts of the borough, also this is formally and majoritised within neighbouring Tower Hamlets.</p>\\n<p>Settlements to the west of the borough followed the line of the former Ermine Street, with De Beauvoir Town\\u00a0\\u2014 a Victorian estate to the west of the (now) Kingsland Road. Further north, lie Dalston, Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill\\u00a0\\u2014 where the borough abuts Haringey.</p>\\n<p>A further group of settlements follow another north-south radial road, with South Hackney to the east of Cambridge Heath Road\\u00a0\\u2014 north of Victoria Park; and Hackney Central commencing at Mare Street. London Fields was formerly common land to the west of this place, but now forms a district in its own right. To the north, Homerton lies immediately east of the centre of Hackney. The River Lea forms the borough's eastern boundary. Hackney Wick, the Hackney Marshes, Lower and Upper Clapton all lie along this eastern boundary.</p>\\n<p>Postal districts were assigned to the former parts of the borough in 1857/8. Most of the borough would originally have been covered by a planned 'NE' postal district, but this was abolished in 1866. Most of the borough is covered by the eastern postal district, but Shoreditch constitutes five separate postcodes. Areas to the west of Kingsland Road and in the north of the borough are predominantly covered by the northern postal district.</p>\\n<p>Traditionally, much of the borough was and remains considered as a part of East London, with Hoxton and Shoreditch being part of the East End of London. In the 2008 revision of the London Plan, the borough was officially reassigned to the north London sub-region for administrative purposes.</p>\\n<h3>Topography</h3>\\n<p>The London Borough of Hackney covers an area of 19.06 square kilometres (7.4\\u00a0sq\\u00a0mi). Its primary geographic feature is the course of the River Lea; and the associated River Lee Navigation, which passes through Hackney Cut\\u00a0\\u2014 an artificial channel of the Lea built in 1770 across the Hackney Marshes to straighten a meander of the natural river. A tributary of the Lea, Hackney Brook was fully culverted in 1860 by the Metropolitan Board of Works.</p>\\n<p>The New River passes through the borough close to Finsbury Park and flows towards Islington. The Regents Canal also crosses the borough to the south of De Beauvoir Town in the west, joining the Hertford Union Canal below Victoria Park.</p>\\n<p>Within the Borough, the land rises westward from the Lea reaching 30 metres (98\\u00a0ft) above sea level at Clapton Common and Stamford Hill. The area around Victoria Park, in the south of the borough lies about 15 metres (49\\u00a0ft) above sea level. At Spring Hill, in Upper Clapton the road descends sharply from 25 metres (82\\u00a0ft) to only 10 metres (33\\u00a0ft) at High Hill Ferry, on the Lee Navigation.</p>\\n<h3>Geology</h3>\\n<p>The Lea and Hackney Marshes are underlain by alluvium soils; and the higher ground between Homerton and Stamford Hill is formed on a widening bed of London Clay. Brickearth deposits are within tongues of clay extending beneath Clapton Common, Stamford Hill and Stoke Newington High Street. The centre and south western districts lie on river terrace deposits of Taplow Gravel. Victoria Park and Well Street Common lie on flood plain gravel.</p>\\n<h3>Climate</h3>\\n<p>This data was taken between 1971 and 2000 at the nearest national weather station in Greenwich; around 7 miles (11.3\\u00a0km) south of Hackney Town Hall:</p>\\n<p><br></p>\\n<h2>Demography</h2>\\n<p>In 1801, the civil parishes that form the modern borough had a total population of 14,609. This rose steadily throughout the 19th century, as the district became built up; reaching 95,000 in the middle of that century. When the railways arrived the rate of population growth increased\\u00a0\\u2014 reaching nearly 374,000 by the turn of the century. This increase in population peaked before World War I, falling slowly in the aftermath until World War II began an exodus from London towards the new towns under the Abercrombie Plan for London (1944). The population is now rising again, and the 2001 census gives Hackney a population of 202,824.</p>\\n<p>The population is ethnically diverse. Of the resident population, 89,490 (41%) people describe themselves as White British. 30,978 (14%) are in other White ethnic groups, 63,009 (29%) are Black or Black British, 20,000 (9%) are Asian or Asian British, 8,501 (4%) describe themselves as 'Mixed', and 6,432 (3%) as Chinese or Other.</p>\\n\\n<p>There is also a large Turkish and Kurdish population resident in Hackney. Turkish and Kurdish communities are located in all parts of the borough, though there is a greater concentration in north and central Hackney.</p>\\n<p>132,931 (66%) of the resident population were British born. A further 10,095 (5%) were born in other parts of Europe, and the remaining 59,798 (29%) born elsewhere in the world.</p>\\n<p>The 2001 census also shows Christianity is the biggest religion in Hackney, with 44% of residents identifying Christian; 18% identified as Muslim, 4% Jewish, and 3% belonged to other religions. A further 19% stated no religion, and 12% did not state a response. By the 2011 census, residents identifying themselves as Christian fell to 38.6%, whilst those with no religion rose to 28.2%. Judaism had a modest increase, Islam had a small increase, and Hinduism made a slight drop.</p>\\n<p>32% of households are owner\\u2013occupied.</p>\\n<p>The largest rise of ethnic groups between 2001 and 2011 was 'Other', which increased by 222%. This was followed by 'Mixed', which rose by 84%.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 2002, the borough entered into a ten-year contract with the <i>Learning Trust</i>, an independent collaborative body that organises education for Hackney's 27,000 pupils in over 70 schools, nurseries and play centres. The trust was set up in response to an OFSTED report that identified failings in the then existing system. Two of London's most successful City Academies are in Hackney with another two in development and plans to rebuild or renovate every other Hackney school by 2016.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<p>Hackney is hardly served by London Underground services: Only Manor House, located on its extreme north-western fringe on the boundary with Haringey, though Old Street sits only a few metres south-west of Hackney in Islington.</p>\\n<p>However, two London Overground lines serve Hackney: the North London Line crosses from west to east while the East London Line runs from Highbury &amp; Islington and passes through Dalston Junction and on south through Haggerston, Hoxton, Shoreditch towards destinations south of the River Thames, including Clapham Junction, Crystal Palace, Croydon, and New Cross.</p>\\n<p>Additionally National Rail's Lea Valley Lines also pass through Hackney, with stations at London Fields, Hackney Downs, Rectory Road, Stoke Newington, Stamford Hill, and Clapton.</p>\\n<p>It is proposed that Crossrail 2, the 'Chelsea-Hackney Line', would provide a direct Underground service to Hackney Central, Dalston and Homerton, although it is currently undecided whether this would be built as London Underground or main line specifications.</p>\\n\\n<h3>London Overground</h3>\\n<p><b>North London Line</b> Travelling west to east\\u00a0\\u2014 nearest London Overground stations are <i>Dalston Kingsland</i>, <i>Hackney Central</i>, <i>Homerton</i> and <i>Hackney Wick</i></p>\\n<p><b>East London Line</b> Travelling north to south\\u00a0\\u2014 nearest London Overground stations are <i>Dalston Junction</i>, <i>Haggerston</i>, <i>Hoxton</i> and <i>Shoreditch High Street</i></p>\\n<h3>Lea Valley Lines</h3>\\n<p>These stations are served by Abellio Greater Anglia:</p>\\n<ul><li>Stamford Hill railway station</li>\\n<li>Stoke Newington railway station</li>\\n<li>Rectory Road railway station</li>\\n<li>Clapton railway station</li>\\n<li>Hackney Downs railway station</li>\\n<li>London Fields railway station</li>\\n</ul><h3>Travel to work</h3>\\n<p>In March 2011, the main forms of transport that residents used to travel to work were: bus, minibus or coach, 16.9% of all residents aged 16\\u201374; underground, metro, light rail, tram, 9.2%; bicycle, 9.2%; on foot, 7.5%; driving a car or van, 7.1%; train, 4.6%; work mainly at or from home, 3.5%.</p>\\n<h2>Notable associated people</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Notable attractions and institutions</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>Abney Park Cemetery \\u2013 overgrown Victorian cemetery and Nature Reserve</li>\\n<li>Arcola Theatre \\u2013 studio theatre</li>\\n<li>National Centre of Circus Arts \\u2013 circus school</li>\\n<li>Geffrye Museum \\u2013 decorative arts museum</li>\\n<li>Hackney Empire \\u2013 theatre</li>\\n<li>Hoxton Hall \\u2013 community centre and performance space</li>\\n<li>Newington Green Unitarian Church \\u2013 London's oldest nonconformist place of worship</li>\\n<li>St John's Hoxton \\u2013 Anglican church (where \\\"Amazing Grace\\\" was written)</li>\\n<li>Shoreditch Town Hall</li>\\n<li>Sutton House \\u2013 Heritage house and museum</li>\\n<li>The Towers of Hackney</li>\\n<li>Transition Gallery \\u2013 contemporary art project space</li>\\n<li>Victoria Miro Gallery \\u2013 contemporary art gallery</li>\\n<li>Vortex Jazz Club \\u2013 live jazz venue</li>\\n<li>White Cube \\u2013 contemporary commercial art gallery</li>\\n</ul><h2>Twinned towns</h2>\\n<p>The London Borough of Hackney has formal twinning arrangements with:</p>\\n<p>And an informal twinning with</p>\\n<dl><dd> Alexandra, South Africa.</dd>\\n</dl><p>The borough also has informal links with South Africa, Turkey, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

The area of Hoxton is bordered by Regent's Canal on the north side, Wharf Road and City Road to the west, Old Street to the south, and Kingsland Road to the east.</p>\\n<p>Hoxton is also a ward, electing three councillors to Hackney London Borough Council. It forms part of the Hackney South and Shoreditch constituency.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Historical Hoxton</h2>\\n<h3>Origins</h3>\\n<p>\\\"Hogesdon\\\" is first recorded in the Domesday Book, meaning an Anglo-Saxon farm (or \\\"fortified enclosure\\\") belonging to <i>Hoch</i>, or <i>Hocq</i>. Little is recorded of the origins of the settlement, though there was Roman activity around Ermine Street, which ran to the east of the area from the 1st century. In medieval times, Hoxton formed a rural part of Shoreditch parish. It achieved independent ecclesiastical status in 1826 with the founding of its own parish church dedicated to St John the Baptist, though civil jurisdiction was still invested in the Shoreditch vestry. The Worshipful Company of Haberdashers remains Patron of the advowson of the parish of St John's.</p>\\n<p>In 1415, the Lord Mayor of London \\\"caused the wall of the City to be broken towards Moorfields, and built the postern called Moorgate, for the ease of the citizens to walk that way upon causeways towards Islington and Hoxton\\\" \\u2013 at that time, still marshy areas. The residents responded by harassing walkers to protect their fields. A century later, the hedges and ditches were destroyed, by order of the City, to enable City dwellers to partake in leisure at Hoxton.</p>\\n<h3>Tudor Hoxton</h3>\\n<p>By Tudor times many moated manor houses existed to provide ambassadors and courtiers country air nearby the City. This included many Catholics, attracted by the house of the Portuguese Ambassador, who, in his private chapel, celebrated the masses forbidden in a Protestant country. One such resident was Sir Thomas Tresham, who was imprisoned here by Elizabeth I of England for harbouring Catholic priests. The open fields to the north and west were frequently used for archery practice, and on 22 September 1598 the playwright Ben Jonson fought a fatal duel in Hoxton Fields, killing actor Gabriel Spencer. Jonson was able to prove his literacy, thereby claiming benefit of clergy to escape a hanging.</p>\\n<p>Hoxton's public gardens were a popular resort from the overcrowded City streets, and it is reputed that the name of Pimlico came from the publican, Ben Pimlico, and his particular brew.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><i>Have at thee, then, my merrie boyes, and beg for old Ben Pimlico\\u2019s nut-brown ale</i>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The gardens appear to have been situated near Hoxton Street, known at that time, as <i>Pimlico Path</i>. The modern area of Pimlico derives its name from its former use in Hoxton.</p>\\n<h3>Gunpowder, treason and a letter</h3>\\n\\n<p>On 26 October 1605 Hoxton achieved notoriety, when a letter arrived at the home of local resident William Parker, Lord Monteagle warning him not to attend the Parliament summoned by James I to convene on 5 November, because \\\"yet I say they shall receive a terrible blow, the Parliament, and yet they shall not see who hurts them\\\". The letter may have been sent by his brother-in-law Francis Tresham, or he may have written it himself, to curry favour. The letter was read aloud at supper, before prominent Catholics, and then he delivered it personally to Robert Cecil at Whitehall. While the conspirators were alerted, by the public reading, to the existence of the letter they persevered with their plot as their gunpowder remained undiscovered. William Parker accompanied Thomas Howard, the Lord Chamberlain, at his visit to the undercroft of Parliament, where Guy Fawkes was found in the early hours of 5 November. Most of the conspirators fled on the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, but Francis Tresham was arrested a few days later at his house in Hoxton. A commemorative plaque is attached to modern flats at the site of Parker's house in Hoxton Street.</p>\\n<h3>Almshouses and madhouses</h3>\\n<p>By the end of the 17th century the nobility's estates began to be broken up. Many of these large houses became to be used as schools, hospitals or mad houses, with almshouses being built on the land between by benefactors, most of whom were City liverymen. Aske's Almshouses were built on Pitfield Street in 1689 from Robert Aske's endowment for 20 poor haberdashers and a school for 20 children of freemen. Hoxton House, was established as a private asylum in 1695. It was owned by the Miles family, and expanded rapidly into the surrounding streets being described by Coleridge as <i>the</i> Hoxton madhouse. Here fee-paying 'gentle and middle class' people took their exercise in the extensive grounds between Pitfield Street and Kingsland Road; including the poet Charles Lamb. Over 500 pauper lunatics resided in closed wards, and it remained the Naval Lunatic Asylum until 1818. The asylum closed in 1911; and the only remains are by Hackney Community College, where a part of the house was incorporated into the school that replaced it in 1921. At this time Hoxton Square and Charles Square were laid out, forming a fashionable area. Non-conformist sects were attracted to the area, away from the restrictions of the City's regulations.</p>\\n<h3>Victorian era and 20th century</h3>\\n\\n<p>In the Victorian era the railways made travelling to distant suburbs easier, and this combined with infill building and industrialisation to drive away the wealthier classes, leaving Hoxton a concentration of the poor with many slums. The area became a centre for the furniture trade.</p>\\n<p>Charles Booth in <i>Life and Labour of the People in London</i> of 1902 gave the following description:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The character of the whole locality is working-class. Poverty is everywhere, with a considerable admixture of the very poor and vicious\\u00a0... Large numbers have been and are still being displaced by the encroachment of warehouses and factories\\u00a0... Hoxton is known for its costers and Curtain criminals, for its furniture trade\\u00a0... No servants</p>\\n<p>are kept except in the main Road shopping streets and in a few remaining middle class squares in the west.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>In Hoxton Street, a plaque marks the location of the Britannia Theatre. This evolved from the former Pimlico tea gardens, a tavern and a saloon, into a 3,000-seat theatre, designed by Finch Hill. Together with the nearby Pollock's Toy Museum, it was destroyed in Second World War bombing. Hoxton Hall, also in Hoxton Street, which survives as a community centre, began life in 1863 as a 'saloon style' music hall. It remains largely in its original form, as for many years it was used as a Quaker meeting house. There was also the 1870 Varieties Music Hall (by C. J. Phipps) in nearby Pitfield Street, this became a cinema in 1910, closing in 1941. Since 2003 the site has remained empty, but in 2008 it was gutted and prepared for a refurb. Local opposition to the design has resulted in the project being put on hold, so it now remains empty and \\\"For Sale\\\".</p>\\n<p>In the former vestry of St Leonard Shoreditch Electric Light Station, just to the north of Hoxton Market, is based The Circus Space. Inside, the \\\"Generating Chamber\\\" and \\\"Combustion Chamber\\\" provide facilities for circus training and production. The building was constructed by the Vestry in 1895 to burn local rubbish and generate electricity. It also provided steam to heat the public baths. This replaced an earlier facility providing gas-light, located in Shoreditch.</p>\\n<p>Gainsborough Studios were located in a former power station, in Poole Street, by the Regents Canal. The film studios operated there from 1924 to 1951. An historical plaque is attached to the building, now a modern apartment block, that occupies the site since the studios' demolition in 2002. The plaque reads</p>\\n<dl><dd><i>London Borough of Hackney</i></dd>\\n<dd><i>The Gainsborough Film Studios 1924\\u20131949</i></dd>\\n<dd><i>Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Balcon, Ivor Novello, Gracie Fields, \\\"The Lady Vanishes\\\", \\\"The Wicked Lady\\\" worked and were filmed here</i></dd>\\n</dl><p>With a new-found popularity, large parts of Hoxton have been gentrified; this has inevitably aroused hostility among some local residents, who believe they are being priced out of the area. Some parts of Hoxton, however, remain deprived with council housing dominating the landscape.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Today</h3>\\n<p>The geographical distinction between Hoxton and Shoreditch is often confused. The two districts have a historical link as part of the same manor, and in the 19th century both formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch. This was incorporated into the newly created London Borough of Hackney in 1965, but old street signs bearing the name are still to be found throughout the area.</p>\\n<p>Manufacturing developments in the years after the Second World War meant that many of the small industries that characterised Hoxton moved out. By the early 1980s, these industrial lofts and buildings came to be occupied by young artists as inexpensive live/work spaces, while exhibitions, raves and clubs occupied former office and retail space at the beginning of the 1990s. During this time Joshua Compston established his Factual Nonsense gallery on Charlotte Road in Shoreditch and organised art fetes in Hoxton Square. Their presence gradually drew other creative industries into the area, especially magazines, design firms, and dot-coms.</p>\\n<p>By the end of the 20th century, the southern half of Hoxton had become a vibrant arts and entertainment district boasting a large number of bars, nightclubs, restaurants, and art galleries. In this period, the new Hoxton residents could be identified by their obscurely fashionable (or \\\"ironically\\\" unfashionable) clothes and their hair (the so-called \\\"Hoxton Fin\\\", as exemplified by Fran Healy of Travis). The excesses and fashion-centricity of Hoxton and Shoreditch denizens have been satirised in the satirical magazine <i>Shoreditch Twat</i>, on the TVGoHome website, and in the sitcom <i>Nathan Barley</i>. This fashionable area centres around Hoxton Square, a small park bordered mainly by former industrial buildings, as well as the elegant 19th century parish church of St John's.</p>\\n<p>The northern half of the district is more residential and contains many council housing estates and new-build private residences. Residents are typically older and the unemployment and crime rates, with the exceptions of drug offences, robbery and theft, are relatively high compared to some parts of the borough. Hoxton Street Market is the focal point of this end of the district. The market sells a wide range of household goods during the week and specialises in independent fashion, art and design products on Saturdays. Nearby is the Geffrye Museum and Hoxton War Memorial.</p>\\n<p>Property prices have continued to rise steeply since the early years of the 21st century as property developers have moved to cash in on the area's trendy image, central location and transport links. Some galleries have, as a result, moved to nearby Shoreditch, or have relocated further afield to cheaper districts such as London Fields or Bethnal Green. In response, the local council formed a not-for-profit corporation, Shoreditch Our Way (now called The Shoreditch Trust), to buy local buildings and lease them out as community facilities and housing. The extension of the East London Line (completed in 2010), has provided the local rail access which was lost when the line from Broad Street closed to services.</p>\\n<h3>Hoxton Market</h3>\\n<p>Hoxton Market, which is now in Hoxton Street rather than its original site to the west of Hoxton Square, was founded in 1687. This market was the cornerstone of the local community but, from the 1980s onwards, changed from a thriving market to one that lost its trade to the move towards supermarkets and away from the traditional street market meeting all of the community's needs. In 2013 the local business community, working with the Council, started work to revive the market and this has attracted great attention and increased trade, complemented by new shops opening along the length of the market.</p>\\n<h2>People with Hoxton links</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>Charles Bradlaugh, founder of the National Secular Society in 1866, was born in Hoxton.</li>\\n<li>Frank Chapple, union leader, was born and raised in Hoxton.

It is bounded by the Hackney districts of Stamford Hill to the west, Lower Clapton and Lea Bridge to the south and the Haringey district of South Tottenham to the north. To the east is the River Lea (spelled Lea or Lee), on the other side of which is the expanse of the Walthamstow Marshes, part of which is in the Lee Valley Park.</p>\\n<p>As is frequently the case with London districts, these boundaries have become uncertain because of the meeting of the developing expansion of the original settlements. Western parts of the area are often considered part of a wider Stamford Hill, understandable perhaps because of the public transport junction and shopping area at Stamford Broadway, and that the Hassidic Jewish community identified as being located in Stamford Hill extends into Upper Clapton.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>Clapton was from 1339 until the 18th century normally rendered as <i>Clopton</i>, meaning the \\\"farm on the hill\\\". The Old English <i>clop</i> - \\\"lump\\\" or \\\"hill\\\" - presumably denoted the high ground which rises from the River Lea. Eventually encompassing the north-eastern quarter of the parish, Clapton grew up along the way which in 1745 was called Hackney Lane, part of which ran through Broad (later Clapton) Common. Building spread to meet streets east of the high road and north of Homerton in the 19th century. Manorial courts from the early 19th century distinguished the parts north and south of Lea Bridge Road as Upper and Lower Clapton, and those names soon passed into general use. Hackney Lane came to be known as Lower and Upper Clapton roads, until in the late 19th century the stretch through the common to Stamford Hill was named Clapton Common.</p>\\n<p>The area, along with Lower Clapton, was known in the 1990s and early 2000s for drug and gun related crimes, gaining it the nickname \\\"Murder Mile.\\\" As well as being featured in the film <i>Bullet Boy</i>, Clapton's reputation was highlighted in an episode of Channel 4's satirical TV show <i>Brass Eye</i> in 1997, which claimed that the petrol station is shoplifted every 30 minutes.</p>\\n<h2>Local features</h2>\\n<h3>On the waterfront</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the most pleasant amenities in Upper Clapton is Springfield Park, which extends down the hill eastwards to the Lea. This park was created in 1905 from the extensive grounds of three mansions, of which only one survives: Springfield House, now known as the White House (a Grade II listed house ), houses a caf\\u00e9 and the municipal rangers' station. The park's sports facilities include five tennis courts and a cricket pitch, while to the north, just across Spring Hill in the recreation ground, there are rugby fields (home of the Hackney RUFC), more tennis courts, and football pitches. Across the Lea, on the ancient Essex and modern London Borough of Waltham Forest border, is Springfield Marina, a packed mooring for narrowboats and other waterway craft, while on the other bank of the river is the Lea Rowing Club.</p>\\n<p>The park received a Green Flag award in July 2008.</p>\\n<p>Aside from the mansion, another \\u2014 and very popular \\u2014 survivor is the Anchor and Hope pub, which is not far from the south-east corner of the park. The area along the Lea was heavily bombed in the Second World War, and the pub is one of the few survivors of the terraced housing that once dominated the area. It is now quite overshadowed by pre- and post-war blocks of flats.</p>\\n<p>Besides Springfield Park, Upper Clapton is delineated to the west by the long leafy strip of Clapton Common, distinguished by the recently regenerated pond (the name Clapton Pond, however, is generally applied by locals to a set of two much smaller ex-reservoirs in Lower Clapton, and bus routes that use Clapton Pond as a terminus point are referring to Lower Clapton). The pond is a favourite with bird watchers \\u2014 besides the usual variety of ducks, geese and swans, such shy birds as grebes and other waders may often be seen feeding in the reed beds.</p>\\n<h3>The Abode of Love</h3>\\n\\n<p>Upper Clapton is home to one of London's more unusual churches, the Church of the Good Shepherd, which was used as a place of worship by the Ancient Catholic Church and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church. However, the church was originally built by the Agapemonite cult in 1892 as the Church of the Ark of the Covenant.</p>\\n<p>The Agapemonites, who held decidedly unconventional views on marriage and the role of women, relocated to Upper Clapton from their spiritual community in Spaxton, Somerset, and had clearly prospered by this time. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, the outside of the church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth from the base of the steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J S Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'.</p>\\n<p>The church, which was completed in 1895, was designed by Joseph Morris in a Gothic Revival style; for its \\\"curiosity value\\\" it was designated a Grade II-listed building on 12 September 1969.</p>\\n\\n<p>The cult had always been surrounded by scandal during its sojourn in Somerset and, after the move to Clapton, this degenerated into sheer farce. The original leader, Henry James Prince, who claimed to be immortal, died in 1899 and was succeeded by the charming but philandering John Hugh Smyth-Pigott, who wasted no time before declaring himself as the Messiah. Challenged by a jeering mob to prove his godhood by walking across Clapton Pond, Smyth-Pigott declined and retired to Somerset, where he was said to enjoy the favours of as many as seven \\\"spiritual brides\\\" a week. Smyth-Pigott, who also claimed immortality, died in 1927, after which the cult went into decline. The Clapton church had already been abandoned by the cult and was acquired first by the Ancient Catholic Church in 1956, and then by the Georgian Orthodox Church in 2005.</p>\\n<h3>The New Synagogue</h3>\\n\\n<p>Close by the Good Shepherd is the stately New Synagogue, on the eastern side of Clapton Common. This Grade II listed building is a little deceptive, appearing much older than it actually is. In spite of its handsome Georgian-style exterior, this is actually post-Edwardian, built in 1915. It is, however, a faithful replica of an earlier building, the Great St Helen's Synagogue in the City of London, which was designed by John Davies in 1838. The current building contains a number of original fixtures from its predecessor. Endangered for a while, the synagogue was restored in 2005.</p>\\n<h3>Brooke House</h3>\\n\\n<p>A large house known as the King's House stood on the site now occupied by BSix Sixth Form College, as early 1476. The house was within a 200-acre (0.81\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) estate, which was described as the Manor of Hackney from about 1532 to the early 17th century \\u2014 although there were two other manors in the south of the Parish.</p>\\n<p>In 1532, Henry Algernon Percy, Earl of Northumberland, acquired the estate from Sir Richard Neville. However, in January 1535 the land was taken by Henry VIII; in settlement of a debt. The King visited the house in April 1535 and on 24 September 1535 he granted his \\\"manor or principal messuage of Hackney\\\" to Thomas Cromwell, his chief minister. Cromwell refurbished the house, and on 1 May 1536, returned the house to the King. In July 1536, Ralph Sadleir brought Mary I of England to the house to swear the Oath of Supremacy before her father, and Jane Seymour, the Queen. Henry continued to own the house until his death in January 1547. Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, died in the house in Hackney known as the \\\"King's House\\\" on 24 June 1604.</p>\\n<p>The name of the house derives from its purchase by Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke, in 1621 \\u2014 which led to ownership by the family for over 200 years. The house became tenanted after 1724, but in 1758\\u20139 the house was modified by a leasee, William Clarke who converted it to a lunatic asylum. The site remained in this use until 1940.</p>\\n<p>The remains of the house were destroyed by enemy action in October 1940. 5.5 acres (0.02\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) of Brooke House were purchased by the London County Council in 1944, and further bomb damage occurred that year. The house was finally demolished in 1954, and archaeological investigations of the Tudor palace took place in 1955\\u20136. New school buildings were erected in 1960, designed by Armstrong and MacManus.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>BSix Sixth Form College is a sixth form college on a site near the Lea Bridge roundabout in Clapton.</p>\\n<h2>Transport and locale</h2>\\n\\n<p>About 2 miles by bus, the nearest London Underground stations are Tottenham Hale, Manor House and Seven Sisters.</p>\\n<dl><dt>Nearest railway stations</dt>\\n</dl><ul><li>Clapton</li>\\n<li>Hackney Central</li>\\n<li>South Tottenham</li>\\n<li>Stamford Hill</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>History of Clapton (British History Online)</li>\\n<li>Clapton at freeservers.com</li>\\n<li>The Lee Valley Park</li>\\n<li>The Spark Caf\\u00e9</li>\\n<li>BSix College Brooke House Website</li>\\n<li>The Clapton Messiah The Agapemonites - Clapton Pond Neighbourhood Action Group</li>\\n<li>The Agapemonites - Clapton Freeservers</li>\\n<li>The New Synagogue (from oldsynagogues.org - shows the impressive interior)</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":2389.1,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":9505961,\"title\":\"Maxwell Hutchinson\",\"text\":\"<p>Hutchinson also played guitar for some time for Lene Lovich, for whom Judge Smith wrote.

Located 3.3 miles (5.3\\u00a0km) northeast of Charing Cross, it was historically an agrarian hamlet in the ancient parish of Stepney, Middlesex.</p>\\n<p>Following population increases caused by the expansion of London during the 18th century, it was split off from Stepney as the parish of Bethnal Green in 1743, becoming part of the Metropolis in 1855 and the County of London in 1889. The parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green in 1900 and the population peaked in 1901, entering a period of steady decline which lasted until 1981.</p>\\n<p>The economic history of Bethnal Green is characterised by a shift away from agricultural provision for the City of London to market gardening, weaving and light industry, which has now all but disappeared. The quality of the built environment had deteriorated by the turn of the 20th century and was radically reformed by the aerial bombardment of World War II and the subsequent social housing developments. Some 173 people were killed at a single incident at Bethnal Green tube station in 1943. Bethnal Green has formed part of Greater London since 1965.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>Toponymy</h3>\\n<p>The place-name <i>Blithehale</i> or <i>Blythenhale</i>, the earliest form of Bethnal Green, is derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>healh</i> ('angle, nook, or corner') and <i>blithe</i> ('happy, blithe'), or from a personal name <i>Blitha</i>. Nearby Cambridge Heath (<i>Camprichesheth</i>), is unconnected with Cambridge and may also derive from an Anglo-Saxon personal name. The area was once marshland and forest which, as <i>Bishopswood</i>, lingered in the east until the 16th century. A settlement's dependence upon water suggests that the 'happy corner' was cleared next to the natural spring, St. Winifred's Well, in Conduit Field at the northern end of the Green. Over time, the name became <i>Bethan Hall Green</i>, which, because of local pronunciation as <i>Beth'n 'all Green</i>, had by the 19th century changed to <i>Bethnal Green</i>.</p>\\n<h3>Early History</h3>\\n\\n<p>A Tudor ballad, the <i>Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i>, tells the story of an ostensibly poor man who gave a surprisingly generous dowry for his daughter's wedding. The tale furnishes the parish of Bethnal Green's coat of arms. According to one version of the legend, found in Percy's <i>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</i> published in 1765, the beggar was said to be Henry, the son of Simon de Montfort, but Percy himself declared that this version was not genuine. The Blind Beggar public house in Whitechapel is reputed to be the site of his begging.</p>\\n<p>Boxing has a long association with Bethnal Green. Daniel Mendoza, who was champion of England from 1792 to 1795 though born in Aldgate, lived in Paradise Row on the western side of Bethnal Green for 30 years. Since then numerous boxers have been associated with the area, and the local leisure centre, York Hall, remains notable for presentation of boxing bouts.</p>\\n<p>In 1841, the Anglo-Catholic Nathaniel Woodard, who was to become a highly influential educationalist in the later part of the 19th century, became the curate of the newly created St. Bartholomew's in Bethnal Green. He was a capable pastoral visitor and established a parochial school. In 1843, he got into trouble for preaching a sermon in St. Bartholomew's in which he argued that <i>the Book of Common Prayer</i> should have additional material to provide for confession and absolution and in which he criticised the 'inefficient and Godless clergy' of the Church of England. After examining the text of the sermon, the Bishop of London condemned it as containing 'erroneous and dangerous notions'. As a result, the bishop sent Woodard to be a curate in Clapton.</p>\\n<h3>The Green and Poor's Land</h3>\\n<p>The Green and Poor's Land is the area of open land now occupied by Bethnal Green Library, the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood and St John's Church, designed by John Soane. In Stow's <i>Survey of London</i> (1598) the hamlet was called <i>Blethenal Green</i>, now called <i>Bethnal Green</i>. It was one of the hamlets included in the Manor of Stepney and Hackney. Hackney later became separated.</p>\\n<p>In 1678 the owners of houses surrounding the Green purchased the land to save it from being built on and in 1690 the land was conveyed to a trust under which it was to be kept open and rent from it used for the benefit of poor people living in the vicinity. From that date until now the trust has administered the land and its minute books are kept in the London Metropolitan Archives.</p>\\n<p>Bethnal House, or Kirby's Castle, was the principal house on the Green. One of its owners was Sir Hugh Platt (1552\\u20131608), author of books on gardening and practical science. Under its next owner it was visited by Samuel Pepys. It became associated with the ballad of the Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (see Thomas Percy).</p>\\n<p>In 1727 it was leased to Matthew Wright and for almost two centuries it was a mad house. Its two most distinguished inmates were Alexander Cruden, compiler of the <i>Concordance to the Bible</i>, and the poet Christopher Smart. Cruden recorded his experience in <i>The London Citizen Grievously Injured</i> (1739) and Smart's stay there is recorded by his daughter. Records of the asylum are kept in the annual reports of the Commissioner in Lunacy. Even today, the park where the library stands is known locally as \\u201cBarmy Park\\u201d.</p>\\n<p>The original mansion, the White House, was supplemented by other buildings. In 1891 the Trust lost the use of Poor's Land to the London County Council. The asylum reorganised its buildings, demolishing the historic White House and erecting a new block in 1896. This building became the present Bethnal Green Library. A history of Poor's Land and Bethnal House is included in <i>The Green</i> (A.J. Robinson and D.H.B. Chesshyre).</p>\\n<h3>Other houses on the Green</h3>\\n<p>The north end of the Green is associated with the Natt family. During the 18th century they owned many of its houses. Netteswell House is the residence of the curator of the Bethnal Green Museum. It is almost certainly named after the village of Netteswell, near Harlow, whose rector was the Rev. Anthony Natt. A few of its houses have become University settlements. In Victoria Park Square, on the east side of the Green, No.18 has a Tudor well in its cellar.</p>\\n<h2>Globe Town</h2>\\n<h3>History</h3>\\n<p>To the east of Bethnal Green (and west of Bow and north of Stepney Green) lies <b>Globe Town</b>, established from 1800 to provide for the expanding population of weavers around Bethnal Green attracted by improving prospects in silk weaving. The population of Bethnal Green trebled between 1801 and 1831, operating 20,000 looms in their own homes. By 1824, with restrictions on importation of French silks relaxed, up to half these looms became idle and prices were driven down. With many importing warehouses already established in the district, the abundance of cheap labour was turned to boot, furniture and clothing manufacture. Globe Town continued its expansion into the 1860s, long after the decline of the silk industry.</p>\\n<h3>Today</h3>\\n<p>Today Globe Town is presented with three globe sculptures situated in three different corners of the town with it town centre called Globe Town Market Square located to the north on Roman Road next to the Cranbooke Estate. The area is home to a large Bangladeshi community. However it is mostly seen outside Globe Town and Bethnal Green as just a part of Bethnal Green and Stepney Green.</p>\\n<h3>Transport</h3>\\n<p>This area as with greater Bethnal Green is served by <i>Bethnal Green</i> as well as <i>Stepney Green</i>. London Buses routes 309 serves the heart of Globe Town with 8, D6 and night route N8 on the north on Roman Road and 25, 205 and N205 on Mile End Road in Stepney Green to the south.</p>\\n<h2>Modern history</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The silk-weaving trade spread eastwards from Spitalfields throughout the 18th century. This attracted many Huguenot and Irish weavers to the district. Large estates of small two story cottages were developed in the west of the area to house them. A downturn in the trade in 1769 led to the Spitalfield Riots, and on 6 December 1769, two weavers accused of 'cutting' were hanged in front of the <i>Salmon and Ball</i> public house.</p>\\n<p>In the 19th century, Bethnal Green remained characterised by its market gardens and by weaving. Having been an area of large houses and gardens as late as the 18th century, by about 1860 Bethnal Green was mainly full of tumbledown old buildings with many families living in each house. By the end of the century, Bethnal Green was one of the poorest slums in London. Jack the Ripper operated at the western end of Bethnal Green and in neighbouring Whitechapel. In 1900, the <i>Old Nichol Street Rookery</i> was demolished, and the Boundary Estate opened on the site near the boundary with Shoreditch. This was the world's first council housing, and brothers Lew Grade and Bernard Delfont were brought up here. In 1909, the Bethnal Green Estate was built with money left by the philanthropist William Richard Sutton which he left for 'modern dwellings and houses for occupation by the poor of London and other towns and populous places in England'.</p>\\n<p>On 3 March 1943 at 8:27PM the unopened Bethnal Green tube station was the site of a wartime disaster. Families had crowded into the underground station due to an air raid siren at 8:17, one of 10 that day. There was a panic at 8:27 coinciding with the sound of an anti-aircraft battery (possibly the recently installed Z battery) being fired at nearby Victoria Park. In the wet, dark conditions the crowd was surging forward towards the shelter when a woman tripped on the stairs, causing many others to fall. Within a few seconds 300 people were crushed into the tiny stairwell, resulting in 173 deaths. Although a report was filed by Eric Linden with the <i>Daily Mail</i>, who witnessed it, it never ran. The story which was reported instead was that there had been a direct hit by a German bomb. The results of the official investigation were not released until 1946. There is now a plaque at the entrance to the tube station which commemorates it as the worst civilian disaster of World War II, and funds are being raised for a memorial. It is estimated that during WWII, 80\\u00a0tons of bombs fell on the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green, affecting 21,700 houses, destroying 2,233 and making a further 893 uninhabitable. There were a total of 555 people killed and 400 seriously injured. Many unexploded bombs remain in the area, and on Monday 14 May 2007, builders discovered a World War II 1 m long 500\\u00a0lb (230\\u00a0kg) bomb.</p>\\n<p>The book <i>Family and Kinship in East London,</i> based on materials gathered in the 1950s, shows an improvement in working-class life. Husbands in the sample population no longer went out to drink but spent time with the family. As a result, both birth rate and infant death rate fell drastically and local prosperity increased. It is true that the infamous gangsters the Kray twins lived in Bethnal Green in the 1960s. However, by the beginning of the 21st century, Bethnal Green and much of the old East End began to undergo a process of gentrification.</p>\\n<p>The former Bethnal Green Infirmary, later the London County Council Bethnal Green Hospital, stood opposite Cambridge Heath railway station. The hospital closed as a public hospital in the 1970s and was a geriatric hospital under the NHS until the 1980s. Much of the site was developed for housing in the 1990s but the hospital entrance and administration block remains as a listed building. Marcus Garvey was at one time buried here, before his body was returned to Jamaica. The Albion Rooms are located in Bethnal Green where Pete Doherty and Carl Bar\\u00e2t of the Libertines used to live when the band was together. It became part of music history as the band would hold Guerilla Gigs in the flat that would be packed with people.</p>\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n\\n<p>Bethnal Green forms a part of Tower Hamlets and Hackney, centred around the Central line tube station at the junction of Bethnal Green Road, Roman Road and Cambridge Heath Road.</p>\\n<p>The district is associated with the E2 postcode district, but this also covers parts of Shoreditch, Haggerston and Cambridge Heath. Between 1986 and 1992, the name <i>Bethnal Green</i> was applied to one of seven neighbourhoods to whom power was devolved from the council. This resulted in replacement of much of the street signage in the area that remains in place. This included parts of both Cambridge Heath and Whitechapel (north of the Whitechapel Road) being more associated with the post code and administrative simplicity than the historic districts.</p>\\n<h2>Demographics</h2>\\n<p>Bethnal Green had a total population of 25,440 at the 2001 census, based on the north and south wards of Bethnal Green. The largest single ethnic group is people of Bangladeshi descent, which constitute 41 per cent of the area's population, every year since 1999 the Baishakhi Mela is celebrated in Weavers Field, Bethnal Green which celebrates the Bengali New Year. The second largest are the White British, constituting 37 per cent of the area's population. Other ethnic groups include Somalis, Black Africans and Black Caribbeans.</p>\\n<h2>Religion</h2>\\n<p>The two main faiths of the people are Islam and Christianity, with 50 per cent Muslim and 34 per cent Christians.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are many historical churches in Bethnal Green. Notable churches include, St John on Bethnal Green, located near the Bethnal Green tube station, on Bethnal Green Road and Roman Road. The church was built from 1826 to 1828 by the architect John Soane. Other notable churches include St Matthew - built by George Dance the Elder in 1746. St Matthew is the mother church of Bethnal Green; the church's opening coincided with a vast population increase in the former village of Stepney, resulting in the need to separate the area around Bethnal Green from the mother Parish of St Dunstan's, Stepney. All but the bell tower, still standing today, was destroyed by fire and the church again suffered devastating damage during the bombing campaigns of the Second World War, resulting in the installation of a temporary church within the bombed-out building. St. Matthew's remains a major beacon of the local East End community and is frequented on Sundays and other religious occasions by a mixture of established locals and more recent migrants to the area.</p>\\n<p>Other churches include St Peter's (1841) and St James-the-Less (1842), both by Lewis Vulliamy, St James the Great by Edward Blore (1843), and St Bartholomew by William Railton (1844). The church attendance in Bethnal Green was 1 in 8 people since 1900, and is estimated around 100 people attend church today (only 10% attend regularly in the UK). Baptisms, marriages and burials have been deposited nearly at all churches in Bethnal Green.</p>\\n<p>There are four Islamic mosques or places of worship in Bethnal Green for the Muslim community. These are the Baitul Aman Mosque and Cultural Centre, Darul Hadis Latifiah, the Senegambian Islamic Cultural Centre and the Globe Town Mosque and Cultural Centre.</p>\\n<p>The London Buddhist Centre, at 51 Roman Road, is one of the largest urban Buddhist centres in the west, and is the focus of a large Buddhist residential and business community in the area.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>Bethnal Green has numerous primary schools serving children aged three to 11. St. Matthias School on Bacon Street, off Brick Lane, is over a century old and uses the Seal of the old Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green as its badge and emblem. The school is over a century old but underwent extensive remodelling in 1994 and added a new sports hall on its Granby Street former playground site in 2006. The school is linked with the nearby 18th century St. Matthew's Church on St. Matthew's Row; pupils attend mass and perform seasonal plays and performances at the church and the Parish reverend provides religious instruction at the school. The Bangabandhu Primary School, named after the father of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujib, a non-selective state community school, was opened in January 1989, moved to a new building in November 1991, and has over 450 pupils. 70% of the school's pupils speak English as a second language, with a majority speaking Sylheti, a dialect of Bengali, at home, but the Ofsted inspectorate deemed Bangabandhu a \\\"successful and effective school\\\" where pupils \\\"achieve well and make good progress\\\".</p>\\n<p>Bethnal Green's oldest secondary school is Raine's Foundation School, with sites on Old Bethnal Green and Approach roads, a voluntary aided Anglican school founded in 1719. The school relocated several times, amalgamating with St. Jude's School  to become coeducational in 1977. Other schools in the area include Bethnal Green Academy, Oaklands School, and Morpeth School.</p>\\n<p>The V&amp;A Museum of Childhood on Cambridge Heath Road houses the child related objects of the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>\\n<p>The Bethnal Park (also known as Barmey Park) and Bethnal Green Library provide leisure facilities and information.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<h3>Rail</h3>\\n<p>The nearest station is <i>Bethnal Green</i> for London Underground and <i>Bethnal Green</i> (not to be confused with the Tube station of the same name) next to Whitechapel and <i>Cambridge Heath</i> in Cambridge Heath for National Rail.</p>\\n<h3>Buses</h3>\\n<p>London Buses 8, 26, 48, 55, 106, 254, 309, 388, D3, D6, N8, N55, N253 all operate within the area.</p>\\n<h3>Roads</h3>\\n<p>Bethnal Green is connected to the National Road Network with the north-south Cambridge Heath Road A107 and the A11 in Whitechapel.</p>\\n<h3>Cycling, walking, waterways</h3>\\n<p>The Regent's Canal runs north and west of the area with a towpath running along it next to Victoria Park, London.</p>\\n<h2>Sport and leisure</h2>\\n<p>Bethnal Green has a Non-League football club Bethnal Green United F.C., which plays at Mile End Stadium.</p>\\n<h3>Location</h3>\\n<p><br></p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>List of people from Tower Hamlets</li>\\n<li>List of schools in Tower Hamlets</li>\\n<li>Stepney Historical Trust</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>\\\"Tower Hamlets London Borough Council information about Bethnal Green\\\".

Its original remit was to unite workers and unemployed alike in order to bring to the fore, the lack of affordability of housing in the United Kingdom, social injustice, corporate greed and the influence of companies and lobbyists on government. Thwarted in their original aim to camp outside the London Stock Exchange, a camp was set up nearby next to St Paul's Cathedral. On 18 January 2012 Mr Justice Lindblom granted an injunction against continuation of the protest; but the protesters remained in place pending an appeal. The appeal was refused on 22 February, and just past midnight on 28 February bailiffs supported by City of London police began to remove the tents.</p>\\n<p>The protests began in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York, United States, and with support from tax avoidance protest group UK Uncut and the London based contingent of the Spanish 15M movement. In October protesters established two encampments in central London: one outside St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London and the other in Finsbury Square just to the north of the City. In November a third major site was opened in a disused office complex owned by UBS. Named by protesters as the <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, the site was located in Hackney until occupiers were evicted in late January 2012. A fourth site was established in late December, at the unused premises of Old Street Magistrates Court in east London. The site's owners objected to its long term use by Occupiers, and agreement was reached for the building to be vacated by the end of January 2012.</p>\\n<p>In February 2012, occupiers were evicted from their main camp in <i>St Paul's</i>, and from the <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, leaving <i>Finsbury Square</i> as the last London site to remain occupied. The Finsbury Square camp was itself cleared by authorities in June 2012; several of the occupiers went on to establish a new camp in Shoreditch Park, but only remained there for a few days. While no longer maintaining a major physical occupation, the <i>Occupy London</i> group continue to organise meetings, events and actions.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Chronology</h2>\\n<h3>2011 events</h3>\\n<h4>October</h4>\\n<p>On 10 October 2011 a campaign was launched on Facebook for protests to take place at the London Stock Exchange on 15 October in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York and with multiple other protests planned worldwide for that day.</p>\\n<p>The London Stock Exchange in Paternoster Square was the initial target for the protesters on 15 October. Attempts to occupy the square were thwarted by police. Police sealed off the entrance to the square as it was private property, a High Court injunction had been granted against public access to the square. 2,500-3,000 people gathered nearby outside St Paul's Cathedral, with around 250 camping overnight. During the afternoon of 15 October Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, the subject of extradition proceedings by the prosecution authorities of Sweden, gave an impromptu speech to the protesters on the topic of anonymity after he was challenged by police for wearing a mask as he walked to the protest. On the Sunday morning the canon of St. Paul's, Reverend Giles Fraser, asked the police to leave the cathedral steps, saying he was happy for people to \\\"exercise their right to protest peacefully\\\" outside the cathedral.</p>\\n<p>By 17 October an encampment of around 150 tents together with makeshift tarpaulin shelters was clustered around the west side of St Paul's Cathedral. On the 17th the Occupy London protesters issued a nine-point 'Initial Statement' drafted by \\\"an assembly of over 500 people on the steps of St Paul's [Cathedral]\\\". On 21 October, the Dean of St Paul's announced that the cathedral would be closing until further notice as a result of the Occupy London camp pitched outside, and asked the protesters to leave the vicinity of the building \\\"so that the cathedral can reopen as soon as possible\\\". On the evening of the 21st it was reported that the protesters had decided that they would remain in their encampment outside the cathedral, and that they believed that they could not be lawfully removed from the site without a court order.</p>\\n\\n<p>On 22 October the protesters established a second camp in Finsbury Square, just north of the City of London in the London Borough of Islington.</p>\\n<p>On 23 October rock band The Featherz performed a guerilla gig at the St Paul's Cathedral camp as their debut concert.</p>\\n\\n<p>On 26 October it was reported that the Dean of St Paul's had decided that the cathedral would reopen on 28 October, following the resolution of all health and safety concerns. The move was described as an \\\"embarrassing U-turn\\\" by the British national newspaper <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>\\n<p>On 27 October Dr Giles Fraser resigned as Canon Chancellor of St Paul's over disagreements on the handling of the demonstrators, saying \\\"I resigned because I believe that the chapter has set on a course of action that could mean there will be violence in the name of the church.\\\"</p>\\n<p>On 28 October the movement's first set of demands, 'Democratise The City of London Corporation' was published as a first step in the challenging of unaccountable global power elites. The 28th also saw the resignation of the part-time Chaplain of St Paul's Fraser Dyer.</p>\\n<h4>November</h4>\\n<p>On 1 November The Rt Revd Graeme Knowles the Dean of St Paul's resigned following the backlash against his Chapter's resolution to forcibly evict the Occupy London protesters from outside the cathedral. The <i>City of London Corporation</i> proceeded to take legal action against the camp at St Pauls, without support from the Cathedral. Canary Wharf Group took legal action on the 3rd, against protesters attempting to <b>Occupy Docklands</b>.</p>\\n<p>On 18 November, protesters took over a disused office complex owned by the bank <i>UBS</i>, located in the London borough of Hackney. The site was opened to the public the following day as the <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, and provides free services including a library, seminars and various discussion related events. On 28 November protesters at the Hackney site said they would contest attempts by lawyers to have them evicted.</p>\\n<p>During the 2011 UK public sector strikes on 30 November, strikers attempted to occupy Panton House in Central London but were challenged by police and subsequently kettled outside the building.</p>\\n<h4>December</h4>\\n\\n<p>In early December the Metropolitan Police added the occupiers to their list of terrorist suspects. On 6 December, members of the bands Radiohead and Massive Attack performed for free at the <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, as part of a Christmas party for the London occupy movement. On 7 December members of occupy met with Hector Sants, the CEO of the Financial Services Authority, to discuss banking reform. The London occupy movement have began to offer sightseeing tours of London to tourists and plan to host further musical events after the success of the gig involving RadioHead and Massive Attack.</p>\\n<p>On 15 December, Jesse Jackson addressed the Occupy camp at St Pauls, saying that Jesus Christ, Gandhi and Martin Luther King were all occupiers, and that: \\\"Occupy is a global spirit, which is now sweeping the nation and the world, fighting for justice for all of God's children\\\". </p>\\n<p>By late December consensus among occupiers at the main camp in St Pauls had seemed to coalesce round a view that is would be better to leave voluntarily as long as they can be allowed to keep a small presence, and negotiations were started to see if agreement could be reached with the Cathedral. Also in late December a fourth site was established in East London at an unused court and police complex. Occupiers announced plans to use the new site to host a symbolic \\\"trial of the 1%\\\"</p>\\n<h3>Overnight occupancy</h3>\\n<p>In the week beginning 24 October 2011 a number of British national newspapers reported that footage from a thermal imaging camera shot by a police helicopter revealed that only around 10% of the tents at the Occupy London camp outside St Paul's were occupied all night. The protesters disputed these claims and the City of London Police later confirmed that neither the details of the thermal imaging cameras nor the occupancy estimates had come from them. Two British national newspapers, the <i>Daily Mail</i> and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, subsequently videoed the camp using thermal imaging equipment, which they claimed confirmed that only around 10% of the tents were occupied all night.</p>\\n<p>The claims were disputed by the protesters and other journalists, who noted that most protesters did not go to sleep at the time of the day when the images were taken, and thermal imaging produces inaccurate results when used on insulative material like those of the tents. The protesters recorded and published videos using the same thermal camera to demonstrate this, and lodged a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission regarding the claims. They also mentioned that many of them are 'ordinary people with jobs and families' and therefore cannot be present on site at all times.</p>\\n<p>The techniques used by the newspapers were subsequently criticised as \\\"rubbish science\\\" by a military scientist, according to reports in <i>The Guardian</i>, although the source asked to remain anonymous.</p>\\n<p>On 11 November police arrested 170 EDL members on Armistice Day when intelligence revealed EDL members planned to attack campers at St Paul's Cathedral.</p>\\n<h3>2011 statements</h3>\\n<h4>Initial statement</h4>\\n<p>On 16 October, a gathering of over 500 Occupy London protesters collectively agreed upon and issued the following 'Initial Statement':</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<ol><li>The current system is unsustainable. It is undemocratic and unjust. We need alternatives; this is where we work towards them.</li>\\n<li>We are of all ethnicities, backgrounds, genders, generations, sexualities dis/abilities and faiths. We stand together with occupations all over the world.</li>\\n<li>We refuse to pay for the banks\\u2019 crisis.</li>\\n<li>We do not accept the cuts as either necessary or inevitable. We demand an end to global tax injustice and our democracy representing corporations instead of the people.</li>\\n<li>We want regulators to be genuinely independent of the industries they regulate.</li>\\n<li>We support the strike on 30 November and the student action on 9 November, and actions to defend our health services, welfare, education and employment, and to stop wars and arms dealing.</li>\\n<li>We want structural change towards authentic global equality. The world\\u2019s resources must go towards caring for people and the planet, not the military, corporate profits or the rich.</li>\\n<li>The present economic system pollutes land, sea and air, is causing massive loss of natural species and environments, and is accelerating humanity towards irreversible climate change. We call for a positive, sustainable economic system that benefits present and future generations.</li>\\n<li>We stand in solidarity with the global oppressed and we call for an end to the actions of our government and others in causing this oppression.\\n\\n</li>\\n</ol></blockquote>\\n<h4>Statement on The City of London Corporation</h4>\\n<p>On Monday 7 November the first set of demands to come out of Occupy London were ratified by the General Assembly at St Paul's Cathedral. Born out of an earlier statement which was praised in the media as an example of how the protestors were sharpening up their act, they aimed to open the City of London Corporation - the local authority for the UK's financial centre - to deeper scrutiny. Those present said that 200 people voted for the document asking the corporation to open itself to freedom of information requests, publish its accounts retrospectively to 2008, and reveal its financial involvements. The statement from the demonstrators also requested the end of business and corporate votes in elections, the removal of \\\"secrecy practices\\\" and the transparent reform of City institutions along with a commission to examine allegations of corruption. Both statements were met with responses from thinkers such as George Monbiot, Nicholas Shaxson and Blue Labour thinker and peer Lord Glasman.</p>\\n<h4>First statement on corporations</h4>\\n<p>On 29 November the Occupy London movement released first statement of demands on corporations, where they called for measures to end tax evasion by wealthy firms.</p>\\n<h3>2012 events</h3>\\n\\n<p>In January 2012, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced his intention to tackle excessive executive pay and crony capitalism, which <i>Financial Times</i> columnist Philip Stephens suggested may be an indication that the PM has signed up to Occupy values.</p>\\n<p>On 18 January, the High court ruled in favour of the <i>City of London Corporation</i>, giving them the power to order the forcible eviction of occupiers from the St Pauls Camp. A spokesperson for the City said they would not further pursue eviction until 20 January, to give occupiers a chance to appeal against the ruling. The appeal date was later set to 13 February 2012. Comparing the St Pauls camp as it was in January 2012 with its first few weeks, journalists such as Sid Ryan, Brendan O'Neill and Laurie Penny noted a change of character, with energy being diverted from political activism into caring for homeless and mentally ill people attracted by the companionship and shelter. Ryan has argued that despite caring for the homeless being a worthwhile cause, it may help the movement achieve change in the wider world if the camp is evicted.</p>\\n<p>On 30 January, occupiers were evicted from the site where they had set up their <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, by bailiffs acting on behalf of UBS, who own the premises.</p>\\n<p>In mid February, Occupy London took over an abandoned school in Islington, which they called the <i>School of Ideas</i>. They were evicted two weeks later, with authorities arranging for the school to be bulldozed on 28 February. Also on 28 February, occupiers and their tents were removed from the area surrounding St. Paul's Cathedral, by a team of bailiffs supported by riot police. The St Pauls site had been the last surviving high profile camp of the worldwide Occupy movement. At the time of its eviction it was also the largest one remaining. According to the <i>Financial Times</i>, Occupy activists insisted that their campaigning would continue, with some displaying banners announcing that the protests so far were \\\"just the beginning.\\\" Comedian Mark Steel compared the efficiency of the police in the clearing of a few tents with their stumbling investigation of News International. \\\"Last year, presumably , if they'd been asked to evict them, they'd have written a report saying: \\\"We have left no stone unturned in pursuing the occupiers, but after driving round the cathedral hundreds of times we have no evidence of any tents anywhere, or indeed of any cathedral.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In April, Bloomberg reported that the St Paul's camp cost London authorities just over a million pounds in monitoring and legal fees, while the Finsbury Square camp had so far cost about \\u00a310,000.</p>\\n<p>Islington Council won a court order to Finsbury Square on 1 June, giving them the authority to perform a forcible eviction. Occupiers tried to establish an alternative camp in Hampstead Heath, but were immediately moved on by the police. Meanwhile other smaller camps emerged in other parts of London, including Leyton Marshes, Wapping and Limehouse. The Finsbury Square camp was evicted in the early hours of 14 June. Some of the occupiers migrated to nearby Shoreditch Park, where they set up their tents. Occupiers have reported mixed views as to whether the new camp was still a political protest. The Evening Standard was told the Shoreditch camp was a temporary base from which to regroup, and that future \\\"high profile\\\" occupations were planned. However other <i>Occupy London</i> supporters suggested that the new camp was no longer a political protest; several of the evicted campers were homeless with nowhere else to go. One activist said it's uncertain whether there will be future physical occupations. By 26 June the <i>Shoreditch Park</i> camp had gone - locals were unsure where to, or even if the campers had chosen to stay together or to disperse.</p>\\n<p>In October, as part of their celebrations to mark their one year anniversary, <i>Occupy London</i> released <i>The Little book of Ideas</i>, a free ebook which aims to explain financial concepts useful in understanding both the 2008 global crisis and ongoing economic inequality. Another event to mark the anniversary involved protestors entering St Paul's Cathedral during a service, to chain themselves to the pulpit. Also in October, they organised a conference at <i>Friends House</i> London, with special guests including Mick McAteer, TUC senior economist Duncan Weldon and Bank of England director Andy Haldane. Haldane told occupiers that they had been correct about inequality being a cause of the financial crisis. He went on to say that Occupy had helped win the debate concerning the need for reform of the financial sector; that they may play a key role in the ongoing reform process; and that: \\\"policy makers, like me, will need your continuing support in delivering that radical change.\\\" According to the <i>Financial Times</i>, this was the first time a senior Central Banker has asserted that Occupy was correct in their analysis of the crisis.</p>\\n<h3>2014 Events</h3>\\n<p>In October of 2014, 50 to 100 protesters occupied Parliament Square for several days. Their goal was \\u201cdirect the energy from current single-issue struggles into a critical mass that can radically challenge the corrupt and unrepresentative system.\\u201d  The camp was established on the 17th of October and the aim was to stay until Sunday the 26th.  However, on the 19th the police unsuccessfully tried to evict the camp. On the 20th around 140 police were part of an operation to remove the tarpaulin the protesters were sitting on. This lead to the Hash-tag tarpaulin revolution. On the 21st police successfully removed the protesters making initially 15 arrests, including Jenny Jones (Green politician) a Green Party Peer.15 more were arrested later as they tried to retake Parliament square. One protester remained in the square based on the Winston Churchill Statue.  He remained there for over 28 hours until being arrested on a number of charges mainly criminal damage.A large number of protesters stayed behind police fencing to continue the vigil.</p>\\n<p>On Thursday the 23rd the organisers staged a show of force. They asked for people to turn up at the green next to the square, where the protest is now based. An extra 300 people arrived to show support. There was a number of speakers present from Ken Loach to the Artist Taxi driver, Mark McGowan (performance artist). After the speeches protesters linked arms and encircled the square during which there was three breaches of the perimeter fence. the protester who had stayed on the Churchill Statue, known only as Dan, was once again arrested on charges of criminal damage, after throwing sausages to police dogs. the total arrests by Thursday was 40, most of which on charges of breaking bylaws. </p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe police have a duty to facilitate peaceful protest in this country which people have a legal right to do, but that appears to end as soon as you come within shouting distance of the Westminster village. The people who run this country should not be able to tuck demonstrators away out of sight. Parliament needs to listen and people should have the right to get their voices heard.\\u201d Jenny Jones</p>\\n<h2>Reaction to Police over-reaction</h2>\\n<p>In early November 2011, Ed Miliband (the UK Leader of the Opposition) said that mainstream politicians should listen to the occupiers, though he also stated that protesters should not be allowed to control the discussion. One worker in a banking software company, David Pinder, responded to the statement: \\\"I think the message is a bit lost because there's no real solutions being offered. It is one thing to say the system doesn't work but I don't hear any alternatives being proposed.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Responding to Jenny's arrest, Green Party leader Natalie Bennett immediately tweeted: \\\"...There are reports that protesters had umbrellas, cash and other items of no conceivable aggressive use confiscated, and that police in large numbers have tried to make their continued presence as physically uncomfortable as possible.</p>\\n<p>\\\"Prime Minister David Cameron was recently rightly speaking up for the rights of free assembly of the people of Hong Kong. He might like to look out his office window and ensure that the same rights are being respected in London.\\\"</p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<p><b>Related portals:</b></p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Occupy London, activist group homepage</li>\\n<li><i>Bank of Ideas</i> homepage</li>\\n<li>Occupy London gallery in <i>The Guardian</i></li>\\n<li>BBC News - St Paul's camp: Occupy London is 'tourist attraction'</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":2422.7,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":1023207,\"title\":\"Herol Graham\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Herol \\\"Bomber\\\" Graham</b> (born 13 September 1959 in Nottingham, England) is generally acknowledged as one of the best British boxers of the post-war era never to have won a world title.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q1548162\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":0}],\"type\":null,\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Shoreditch_Park_in_2008.jpg\",\"title\":\"Shoreditch Park\",\"lon\":-0.087354,\"wikidata\":\"Q7501392\",\"lat\":51.534794,\"pageid\":18826995,\"ns\":0,\"extract\":\"<p><b>Shoreditch Park</b> is an open space in Hoxton, in the London Borough of Hackney.

It lies between Liverpool Street and Mile End stations, and in Travelcard Zone 2. The station was opened as part of the long planned Central line eastern extension on 4 December 1946; before that it was used as an air-raid shelter. On 3 March 1943, 173 people were killed in a crush while attempting to enter the shelter.</p>\\n<p>The station is an example of the \\\"New Works Programme 1935 - 1940\\\" style adopted by London Transport for its new tube stations. Extensive use is made of pale yellow tiling, originally manufactured by Poole Pottery. This has been replicated during the 2007 modernisation although several panels of original tiling were retained on the platforms. The finishes include relief tiles, showing symbols of London and the area served by the London Passenger Transport Board, designed by Harold Stabler. The station entrances, all in the form of subway access staircases to the subterranean ticket hall, all show the design influences of Charles Holden, the consulting architect for London Transport at this time.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Wartime disaster</h2>\\n<p>Construction of the Central line's eastern extension was started in the 1930s, and the tunnels were largely complete at the outbreak of the Second World War although rails were not laid. The facilities at Bethnal Green were requisitioned in 1940 at the onset of the first Blitz and administration was assigned to the local authority, the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green, under the supervision of the 'Regional Commissioners', the generic name for London civil defence. Heavy air raids began in October and thousands of people took shelter there, often remaining overnight. However, usage of the shelter dwindled in 1941 as the Luftwaffe was redirected away from London and against the Soviet Union. A relative lull occurred although the number of shelterers rose again when retaliatory bombing in response to Royal Air Force raids was expected.</p>\\n<p>This was the case on 3 March 1943, after British media reported a heavy RAF raid on Berlin on the night of 1 March. The air-raid Civil Defence siren sounded at 8:17 pm, triggering a heavy but orderly flow of people down the blacked-out staircase from the street. A middle-aged woman and a child fell over, three steps up from the base and others fell around her, tangled in an immovable mass which grew, as they struggled, to nearly 300 people. Some managed to get free but 173, most of them women and children, were crushed and asphyxiated. Some 60 others were taken to hospital. News of the disaster was withheld for 36 hours and reporting of what had happened was censored, giving rise to allegations of a cover-up. At the end of the war, the Minister of Home Security, Herbert Morrison quoted from a secret report to the effect that there had been a panic, caused by the discharge of anti-aircraft rockets. But other authorities who looked into what had happened disagreed; the Shoreditch Coroner, Mr W R H Heddy said that there was \\\"nothing to suggest any stampede or panic or anything of the kind\\\"; Mr Justice Singleton, summarising his decision in <i>Baker v Bethnal Green Corporation</i>, an action for damages by a bereaved widow \\\"there was nothing in the way of rushing or surging\\\" on the staircase; the Master of the Rolls, Lord Greene, reviewing the lower court's judgement said \\\"it was perfectly well known .. that there had been no panic\\\". Lord Greene also rebuked the Ministry for getting the case to be held in secret.</p>\\n<p>The Baker lawsuit was followed by other claims, resulting in a total payout of nearly \\u00a360,000, the last of which was made in the early 1950s. The secret official report, by a Metropolitan magistrate, Laurence Rivers Dunne, acknowledged that Bethnal Green Council had warned London Civil Defence, in 1941, that the staircase needed a crush barrier to slow down the crowds, but was told that would be a waste of money.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was not until 50\\u00a0years after the disaster that a discreet commemorative plaque was erected at the site.</p>\\n<p>The crush at Bethnal Green is thought to have been the largest single loss of civilian life in the UK in World War II and the largest loss of life in a single incident on the London Underground network. The largest number killed by a single wartime bomb was 68 at Balham, though there were many more British civilians killed in single bombing raids.</p>\\n<p>The \\\"Stairway to Heaven Memorial Trust\\\" was established in 2007 to create a memorial to those who died in the disaster. Planning permission has been granted for a memorial in the form of a bronze staircase with 173 points of light, designed by local architects Harry Patticas and Jens Borstlemann.</p>\\n<h3>'TUBE' Art Installation</h3>\\n<p>In November 2013 sound artist Kim Zip  created an installation  commemorating the Bethnal Green Tube Disaster. The work was backed by London's Whitechapel Gallery and promoted as part of the organisation's 'First Thursdays'  initiative for popular art.</p>\\n<p>'TUBE'  exhibited over a period of four weeks in the belfry of Sir John Soane's St John on Bethnal Green Church.

The company was initially based at Islington Studios which were built as a power station for the Great Northern &amp; City Railway it was later converted to studios. Other films were made at Lime Grove and Pinewood Studios. The former Islington studios were demolished in 2002 and flats built on the site in 2004. A London Borough of Hackney historical plaque is attached to the building. The studio is best remembered for the Gainsborough melodramas it produced in the 1940s. </p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>Gainsborough was founded in 1924 by Michael Balcon and was a sister company to the Gaumont British from 1927, with Balcon as Director of Production for both studios. Whilst Gaumont-British, based at Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush produced the 'quality' pictures, Gainsborough mainly produced 'B' movies and melodramas at its Islington Studios. Both studios used continental film practices, especially those from Germany, with Alfred Hitchcock being encouraged by Balcon\\u2014who had links with UFA\\u2014to study there and make multilingual co-production films with UFA, before the war. In the 1930s, actors Elisabeth Bergner and Conrad Veidt, art director Alfred Junge, cinematographer Mutz Greenbaum and screenwriter/director Berthold Viertel, along with others, joined the two studios.</p>\\n<p>The studio's opening logo was of a lady (Glennis Lorimer) in a Georgian era period costume sitting in an ornate frame, turning and smiling, based on the famous portrait of Sarah Siddons by Gainsborough. The short piece of music was written by Louis Levy and called Gainsborough Minuet.</p>\\n<p>After the departure of Balcon to MGM-British, the Rank Organisation gained an interest in Gainsborough and the studio made such popular films as <i>Oh, Mr Porter!</i> (1937) and Hitchcock's <i>The Lady Vanishes</i> (1938). By 1937, Gaumont-British were in financial crisis, and closed their Lime Grove studios, moving all production to the Islington Poole Street studio. However, the tall factory chimney on the site was considered dangerous in the event of bombing during World War II, and thus Gainsborough Studios were evacuated to Lime Grove for the duration of hostilities.</p>\\n<p>From 1942 to 1946, a series of morally ambivalent costume melodramas was produced by Gainsborough for the domestic market. They were mostly based on recent popular books by female novelists. Prominent titles included the <i>The Man in Grey</i> (1943), <i>Madonna of the Seven Moons</i> (1944), <i>Fanny by Gaslight</i> (1944), <i>The Wicked Lady</i> (1945) and <i>Caravan</i> (1946). The films featured a stable of leading British actors, among them Margaret Lockwood, James Mason, Stewart Granger and Patricia Roc. The studio also made modern-dress comedies and melodramas such as <i>Love Story</i> (1944), <i>Two Thousand Women</i> (1944), <i>Time Flies</i> (starring Tommy Handley, 1944), <i>Bees in Paradise</i> (with Arthur Askey directed by Val Guest, 1944), <i>They Were Sisters</i> (1945), and <i>Easy Money</i> (1948).</p>\\n<p>Subsequent productions, overseen by Betty Box (who at the time was the only major female producer in British cinema), included <i>Miranda</i> (1948) and the Huggett family series with Jack Warner, Kathleen Harrison, and Petula Clark. Unhappy with the performance of the studio, Rank closed it down in early 1949. Production was concentrated at Pinewood Studios. Although at first films continued to be made there under the Gainsborough banner, this quickly stopped and no further Gainsborough films were released after 1951.</p>\\n<h2>Demolition</h2>\\n<p>The Lime Grove site was taken over by the BBC in 1949 and used for TV current affairs and other programmes until it was closed in 1991. The buildings were demolished in the early 90s, and replaced with housing called <i>Gaumont Terrace</i> and <i>Gainsborough Court</i>.</p>\\n<p>The former Islington Studios, in Poole Street, remained largely derelict after their closure in 1951 apart from occasional art performances, including two epic Shakespearean productions by the Almeida Theatre Company, April\\u2013July 2000, directed by Jonathan Kent and starring Ralph Fiennes, and a closing <i>Hitchcock season</i> in October 2003.</p>\\n<p>The buildings began to be cleared in 2002, and apartments named <i>Gainsborough Studios</i> were built on the site in 2004, by architects Munkenbeck and Marshall.</p>\\n<h2>Films</h2>\\n\\n<h2>References and notes</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\\n<ul><li>Cook, Pam (ed), <i>Gainsborough Pictures</i> (1997);</li>\\n<li>Harper, Sue, <i>Picturing the Past: the Rise and Fall of the British Costume Film</i> (1994);</li>\\n<li>Harper, Sue, <i>Women in British Cinema</i> (2000).</li>\\n</ul><h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li><i>Gainsborough Pictures</i> at the British Film Institute's Screenonline</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":2446.6,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":415149,\"title\":\"Neil Gerrard\",\"text\":\"<p>From 1965 he taught at the Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for Boys, Barnet, leaving in 1968 to take up the position of lecturer in computing at the Hackney College, where he remained until his election to parliament 24 years later.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q6988615\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":41257653,\"title\":\"Susanna Heron\",\"text\":\"<p>In 1995 Heron completed her first site specific commission 'Slate Frieze', 23 rectangular slabs of engraved slate over a 21m length wall in the Council of the European Union, Brussels.

Initially run by Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) and, following that, by Hackney Council, when it was renamed. It is now an independent institution, mainly funded through public funds. For a few years it was known as The Community College Shoreditch but has now reverted to the name Hackney Community College (dating from the process known as \\\"incorporation\\\" in 1993 when it was formed from the merger of Hackney College, Hackney 6th Form Centre and Hackney Adult Education Institute)</p>\\n<p>Hackney College is a co-sponsor of Hackney University Technical College, a new university technical college which is opened in dedicated buildings at the main campus of Hackney College in September 2012.</p>\\n<h2>Previous institutions known as Hackney College</h2>\\n<p>'Hackney College' has also been widely used (by Pevsner and others) to refer specifically to Brooke House, until September 2002 one of the Community College's sites.

In these years it attracted some notable students, including William Hazlitt. In 1850 it split into two parts. The teacher training component moved to Cambridge, where it is still known as Homerton College; the theological functions stayed in London as part of the three-college merger that created New College London.</li>\\n</ul><ul><li>One name for the seminary co-founded by George Collison (b. 1772- d. 1847). It was also known as Hackney Academy or Hackney Theological Seminary, or Hackney Itineracy, but became best known as the <b>Hackney College</b> after 1871, a name which stuck even after its 1887 move to Finchley Road, Hampstead. Its principal at about this time was Peter Taylor Forsyth.</li>\\n</ul><p>Both of these merged in 1900, becoming the University of London's first Faculty of Theology. In 1924 this became, by Act of Parliament, a constituent college known as <b>Hackney and New College</b>, the two names by which its disparate buildings throughout north London were commonly known. In 1934 new premises were planned. In 1936, the name of the college was simplified to New College London, harking back to the Congregationalist merger of 1850.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n<ol class=\\\"references\\\"><li id=\\\"cite_note-1\\\"><b>^</b> 'Coward College, Byng Place', Survey of London: volume 21: The parish of St Pancras part 3: Tottenham Court Road &amp; neighbourhood (1949), pp. 91.

After the Reformation in 1578 it became a Calvinist church, which it remains today. It stands in De Wallen, now Amsterdam's main red-light district. The square surrounding the church is the Oudekerksplein.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>By around 1213, a wooden chapel had been erected at the location of today's Oude Kerk. Over time, this structure was replaced by a stone church that was consecrated in 1306.</p>\\n<p>The church has seen a number of renovations performed by 15 generations of Amsterdam citizens. The church stood for only a half-century before the first alterations were made; the aisles were lengthened and wrapped around the choir in a half circle to support the structure. Not long after the turn of the 15th century, north and south transepts were added to the church creating a cross formation. Work on these renovations was completed in 1460, though it is likely that progress was largely interrupted by the great fires that besieged the city in 1421 and 1452.</p>\\n<p>Before the <i>Alteratie</i>, or Reformation in Amsterdam of 1578, the Oude Kerk was Roman Catholic. Following William the Silent\\u2019s defeat of the Spanish in the Dutch Revolt, the church was taken over by the Calvinist Dutch Reformed Church. Throughout the 16th-century battles, the church was looted and defaced on numerous occasions, first in the Beeldenstorm of 1566, when a mob destroyed most of the church art and fittings, including an altarpiece with a central panel by Jan van Scorel and side panels painted on both sides by Maarten van Heemskerck. Only the paintings on the ceiling, which were unreachable, were spared.</p>\\n<p>Locals would gather in the church to gossip, peddlers sold their goods, and beggars sought shelter. This was not tolerated by the Calvinists, however, and the homeless were expelled. In 1681, the choir was closed-off with screen of oak. Above the screen is the text, <i>The prolonged misuse of God's church, were here undone again in the year seventy-eight,</i> referring to the Reformation of 1578.</p>\\n<p>In that same year, the Oude Kerk became home to the registry of marriages. It was also used as the city archives; the most important documents were locked in a chest covered with iron plates and painted with the city\\u2019s coat of arms. The chest was kept safe in the iron chapel.</p>\\n<p>The bust of famous organist and composer Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck (1562-1621) celebrates the lifetime he spent playing in the church. His early career began at the age of fifteen when he succeeded his deceased father Pieter Swybertszoon as the Oude Kerk\\u2019s organist. He went on to compose music for all 150 Psalms and secured an international reputation as a leading Dutch composer. His music would also be played over the city from the church\\u2019s bell tower. He is buried in the church.</p>\\n<p>Rembrandt was a frequent visitor to the Oude Kerk and his children were all christened here. It is the only building in Amsterdam that remains in its original state since Rembrandt walked its halls. In the Holy Sepulchre is a small Rembrandt exhibition, a shrine to his wife Saskia van Uylenburgh who was buried here in 1642. Each year on 9 March (8 March in leap years), at 8:39 am, the early morning sun briefly illuminates her tomb. An early spring breakfast event is held annually.</p>\\n<h2>Structure</h2>\\n<p>The church covers an area of some 3,300\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> (36,000\\u00a0sq\\u00a0ft). The foundations were set on an artificial mound, thought to be the most solid ground of the settlement in this marshy province.</p>\\n<p>The roof of the Oude Kerk is the largest medieval wooden vault in Europe. The Estonian planks date to 1390 and boast some of the best acoustics in Europe.</p>\\n<p>The Oude Kerk contains 12 misericords, leaning posts installed underside folding seats.</p>\\n<h3>Graves</h3>\\n<p>The floor consists entirely of gravestones. The reason for this is that the church was built on a cemetery. Local citizens continued to be buried on the site within the confines of the church until 1865. There are 2500 graves in the Oude Kerk, under which are buried 10,000 Amsterdam citizens, including:</p>\\n<ul><li>Jacob van Heemskerck, naval hero</li>\\n<li>Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, composer and organist</li>\\n<li>Adriaen Block, trader and explorer</li>\\n<li>Jacob de Graeff Dircksz., Amsterdam regent</li>\\n<li>Cornelis de Graeff, Amsterdam regent</li>\\n<li>Andries de Graeff, Amsterdam regent</li>\\n<li>Pieter Lastman, painter</li>\\n<li>Willem van der Zaan, Admiral</li>\\n<li>Laurens Bake, poet</li>\\n<li>Abraham van der Hulst, Admiral</li>\\n<li>Saskia van Uylenburgh, Wife of Rembrandt</li>\\n<li>Cornelis Hooft, statesman</li>\\n<li>Jan Jacobszoon Hinlopen, merchant</li>\\n<li>Kiliaen van Rensselaer, owner of the only successful patroonship in New Netherland, Rensselaerswyck.</li>\\n<li>Frans Banning Cocq, central figure in Rembrandts masterpiece <i>The Night Watch</i></li>\\n<li>Nicasius de Sille, Ambassador</li>\\n</ul><h3>Organs</h3>\\n<p>The Oude Kerk holds four pipe organs, the old church organ built in 1658 and the cabinet organ built in 1767. The third was built by the German Christian Vater in 1724 and is regarded as one of the finest Baroque organs in Europe. It was acknowledged by the church Commissioners as \\u201cperfect.\\u201d The organ was dismantled whilst renovations were made to the church tower in 1738, and upon reassembling it, Casper M\\u00fcller made alterations to give the organ more force. It became known as the Vater-M\\u00fcller organ, to acknowledge the improvement of sound. The fourth was constructed for the church by Organi Puccini of Pisa in 2010.</p>\\n<h2>Today</h2>\\n<p>In mid-March each year, Catholics arrive at the Oude Kerk to celebrate the \\\"Miracle of Amsterdam\\\" that occurred in 1345. After taking communion, a dying man vomited the Host. When his vomit was thrown into a fire, the Host did not burn and was proclaimed a miracle. The Host was put in a chest and installed at the Oude Kerk; however, it disappeared during the Reformation.</p>\\n<p>Today, the Oude Kerk is a centre for both religious and cultural activities and can be rented for presentations, receptions and dinner parties. Among the events hosted is the prestigious annual World Press Photo awards ceremony. The venue hosts many concerts with performers including the BBC Singers and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.</p>\\n<p>Part of the Oudekerksplein, the square surrounding the church, is used by prostitutes who offer their services from behind windows. The street also features a bronze relief of a hand caressing a breast that was set in the cobblestone at night by an anonymous artist. In March 2007, a bronze statue named <i>Belle</i> honoring the prostitutes of the world was also installed there.</p>\\n<h2>Gallery</h2>\\n<ul class=\\\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\\\"><li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Oude Kerk - official site (Dutch)</li>\\n<li>Oude Kerk congregation - Protestant congregation of the Oude Kerk (Dutch)</li>\\n<li>Typisch Amsterdams - Oude Kerk - history and architecture of the Oude Kerk.

The Zeedijk neighbourhood is also known as the Nautical Quarter (Dutch: <i>Nautisch Kwartier</i>) because of its past as a sailor's neighbourhood.</p>\\n<p>The zeedijk was constructed as seawall or <i>dike</i> to protect Amsterdam from the water of the IJ, which was in open connection with the Zuiderzee until 1872. The street's curvature is a noticeable remnant of its adherence to the contours of the old dike. Halfway along the dike is the former Sint Anthoniespoort, the old city gate now called the Waag.

The area is also bordered by a small Chinatown.</p>\\n<p>The area also has a number of sex shops, sex theatres, peep shows, a sex museum, a cannabis museum, and a number of coffee shops that sell marijuana.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n<p>The Rokin and Damrak run along the original course of the river Amstel. These two roads meet in Dam Square which marks the spot a bridge was built across the river in 1270. It had doors which were used to dam the river at certain times to avoid flooding. The Damrak then became a harbor and it was around this area that the red light district first appeared. The walled canals led to the names <i>De Wallen</i> and <i>Walletjes</i> (little walls).</p>\\n<p>Historically because of proximity to the harbor the area has attracted both prostitution and migrant populations and these are the features it is best known for today.</p>\\n<p>From late Medieval times the trade started to be restricted. Married men and priests were forbidden to enter the area. In 1578 during the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule a Protestant city board was formed with fornication deemed punishable. Working girls were banned and forced underground. They would work for a madam who provided room and board, protection and advice. Often the madam and girls would venture out at night visiting pubs and inns to pick up clients. Parlours remained illegal but tolerated if kept hidden. Trade remained small scale though spread across the city. Well known areas were De Haarlemmerdijk, De Houttuinen, Zeedijk and around the harbor.</p>\\n<p>In the 18th century wealthy men would meet working girls at gambling houses on De Gelderskade and Zeedijk. The girls would then take the men back to the parlors where they came from. However these were often unappealing to a gentleman of means. A solution to this problem was for the gambling houses to provide board for the girls. This suited everyone including the authorities. The gambling houses invested in luxury furnishings and gradually they became brothels employing up to 30 girls. Famous brothels included De Pijl in Pijlstraat, De Fonteyn in Nieuwmarkt and Madame Therese on the Prinsengracht. For those who could not afford these there were still girls to be found around Oudekerk and unofficial policies of tolerance remained although prostitution was technically illegal.</p>\\n<p>In 1811 the ban on working girls was lifted. In this Napoleonic period, French soldiers were the main customers of prostitutes in De Wallen. Regulation was brought in and there were compulsory health checks to protect soldiers from VD. They were given a red card which was a permit to work. If found to be infected the card was taken until they could prove they were disease free again. Because there was no reliable treatment for syphilis until the early 20th century this could mean dangerous treatments such as mercury baths to ease symptoms.</p>\\n<p>In the early 20th century religious organizations ran campaigns to try to end tolerance of prostitution. In 1911 a law was passed banning brothels and pimping. Working girls themselves were not banned though. Once again it was driven underground and tolerated as long it did not cause a disturbance. With the closure of many parlors in De Wallen some girls moved to De Pijp.</p>\\n<p>In 1935 it was estimated that there were around 150 disguised parlors. Fronts included massage, pedicure, manicure, and beauty treatments. Working girls continued to work around the Oudekerk (Oudekerksplein). Instead of being visible as they are today they would stand behind closed curtains and peer through a small crack looking for customers. If they stood in the doorway they would be arrested.</p>\\n<h2>Location</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>The total area is approximately 6,500 square metres (1.6 acres), limited by the Niezel in the north, the sea dike/Nieuwmarkt in the east, the Sint Jansstraat in the south and the Warmoesstraat in the west. Prostitution takes place within this area in the following streets: Barndesteeg, Bethlehemsteeg, Bloedstraat, Boomsteeg (now closed), Dollebegijnensteeg, Enge Kerksteeg, Goldbergersteeg, Gordijnensteeg, Molensteeg, Monnikenstraat, Oudekerksplein, Oudekennissteeg, Oudezijds Achterburgwal, Oudezijds Voorburgwal, Sint Annendwarsstraat, Sint Annenstraat, Stoofsteeg and Trompettersteeg.</p>\\n<p>Between Sint Jansstraat and Sint Annenstraat and running parallel to them are Leidekkerssteeg, Gooijersteeg, Blaauwlakensteeg and Zwartlakensteeg. At least three of these had red light windows which were closed in the 1970s. Today these alleys are blocked by locked gates although the remains of some bricked over windows can be seen in the architecture. In the 1990s Slapersteeg was also closed and a gate now blocks the alley.</p>\\n<p>In the 1990s parts of Sint Annenstraat and Sint Annendwarsstraat were demolished. The rooms in Goldbergersteeg were opened after this time.</p>\\n<h2>Sex work</h2>\\n\\n<p>Prostitution is legal in the Netherlands, with the exception of street prostitution, but work permits are not issued in the form of a green card for prostitution; therefore legally working in the trade is limited mostly to EU citizens or foreign permanent residents. (A non-EU citizen can work legally in Netherlands without a work permit in certain circumstances, for instance, if they are the spouse of a local citizen.) From January 2013 the legal working age of a prostitute in the Netherlands was raised from 18 to 21.</p>\\n<p>Whilst health and social services are readily available, sex workers are required to undergo regular health checks at the government's expense. Brothel owners and room operators often require health certificates such as the SERVSAFE test before employing or leasing rooms.</p>\\n<p>To counter negative publicity, Mariska Majoor, founder of the Prostitution Information Center, organized two \\\"open days\\\" in February 2006 and March 2007, allowing visitors access to some window brothels and peep shows and informing them about the working conditions there. Majoor was also instrumental in having the world's first monument to sex workers installed in the red light district. The bronze statue was unveiled on the <i>Oudekerksplein</i> in front of the Oude Kerk at the open day in March 2007 and shows a woman standing in a doorway.</p>\\n<h2>Cannabis coffeeshops</h2>\\n<p>Cannabis coffee shops in the RLD and elsewhere in the Netherlands are licensed to sell cannabis and serve soft drinks. Food, alcohol, and indoor tobacco smoking are generally not permitted.</p>\\n<p>Before the onset of coffeeshop licensing, some began openly selling cannabis. The first coffee shops opened in the 1970s. These faced trouble from police and the local councils with frequent closures. In 1976, the government of the Netherlands began to take steps to decriminalize the use and possession of cannabis by changing the law so that possession of up to 30 grams of cannabis was no longer a criminal offense.</p>\\n<p>The 'Gedoogbeleid' or tolerance policy gave rise to coffeeshop licensing which meant that as long as coffeeshops did not sell hard drugs, they were allowed to operate. Coffeeshops were not allowed to operate in certain cities near the borders of Germany and Belgium because it was felt soft drug use might raise crime there.</p>\\n<p>The government of Netherlands has continually been under pressure from different western countries to reign in coffeeshops, leading to several coffeeshops being shut down for flouting rules, with no licenses issued to new operators. This approach has continued since 1995. In the 1990s, the coffeeshop owners organized themselves into a union, the Bond van cannabis Detaillisten or BCD, set up to represent the interests of the coffeeshops which were under constant pressure from local councils.</p>\\n<p>A recent policy has ordered that 26 coffeeshops in the De Wallen area will have to close their doors between 1 September 2012 and 31 August 2015.</p>\\n<h2>Abuses and human rights</h2>\\n\\n<p>Netherlands has been listed by the UNODC as a top destination for victims of human trafficking.</p>\\n<p>According to Job Cohen, the former mayor of Amsterdam, \\\"We've realized this is no longer about small-scale entrepreneurs but that big crime organizations are involved here in trafficking women, drugs, killings and other criminal activities\\\".</p>\\n<p>Groups of sex workers have also worked to raise awareness of their rights. The Prostitute Information Centre founded in the 1990s is a prostitute-led organisation offering tours of the area and information concerning safety and rights of the people involved. While sex workers in brothels currently have to register, it has been suggested making escorts and kamer workers register, which has been opposed by some sex worker groups out of concern it would favor pimps over the workers themselves. Jan Fisher of Red Thread commented: \\u201cThe ones who want to work know how devastating the stigma could be, and will be. They will try to work outside this system and they\\u2019ll be vulnerable when they\\u2019re detected by the police and tax office, and the ones who are trafficked may be forced by their pimps to register so they have a kind of legal status.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>In 2007 a statue called \\\"Belle\\\" was unveiled on the Oudekerksplein with the inscription \\\"Respect sex workers all over the world\\\".</p>\\n<p>About 75% of Amsterdam's prostitutes are from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia, according to a former prostitute who produced a report about the sex trade. </p>\\n<p>Eastern European citizens of the 28 member EU states have the legal right under internal market to employment in the Netherlands in any work. Citizens of other countries must already have a valid residence permit (not visitor visa) to work legally in the sex trade as work permits are not issued for the jobs.</p>\\n<p>TAMPEP research into origin of migrant sex workers records 60% of workers in the Netherlands are foreign born, with the highest proportion of these (43%) from elsewhere in Europe. This represents a decrease from 70% migrants in sex work as recorded in 2006. The report cites high internal mobility within the EU as the reason for this decrease.</p>\\n\\n<p>In 2004, Amsterdam authorities commissioned research into pimping and human trafficking in Amsterdam. The Willem Plompe institution took up that job. The researchers, under the leadership of professor Frank Bovenkerk, found that women under the control of a pimp can be easily put to work in the legal brothels with the brothel owners being aware that the women are controlled by pimps. The general setup of window prostitution was said to be helpful to pimps, as it facilitates the direct control of the women by their pimp.</p>\\n<p>A Christian organization of aid workers named the 'Scharlaken Koord\\u2019 (in English, <i>Scarlet Cord</i>) has set up a special 'pal'-program for prostitutes in which the pals help the women build a new social network.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>In September 2007, the city council of Amsterdam at the behest of mayor Job Cohen, concerned about trafficking and pimping in the area, forced the owner Charlie Geerts to close 51 prostitution windows, reducing the total number of windows in De Wallen by a third. Amsterdam authorities bought 18 properties from Geerts, with the aim of developing the area with fashion designers and other upscale businesses.</p>\\n<p>Mariska Majoor of the Prostitution Information Center and representatives of the sex worker rights group De Rode Draad have decried the decision, claiming it would not reduce crime but would only lead to higher rent and more competition for the remaining windows.</p>\\n<p>In January 2008, the city council announced plans to close the Rosso live sex theatre and the <i>Banana bar</i> strip club in the area. Local business owners have formed the group \\\"Platform 1012\\\" (named after the zipcode of the area) to oppose the efforts of the Amsterdam government. In the end, the actions of the city government resulted in the closure of the Yab Yum brothel.</p>\\n<p>At the end of 2008, mayor Job Cohen announced plans to close half of the city\\u2019s 400 prostitution windows because of suspected criminal gang activity; part of the city's 70 marijuana cafes and sex clubs will also be closed. Mayor Job Cohen: \\\"It is not that we want to get rid of our red-light district. We want to reduce it. Things have become unbalanced and if we do not act we will never regain control\\\".</p>\\n<p>In 2009, the Dutch justice ministry announced plans to close 320 prostitution \\\"windows\\\" from Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p>A former Amsterdam prostitute who is now a city councillor said: \\\"There are people who are really proud of the red light district as a tourist attraction. It's supposed to be such a wonderful, cheery place that shows just what a free city we are. But I think it's a cesspit. There's a lot of serious criminality. There's a lot of exploitation of women, and a lot of social distress. That's nothing to be proud of.\\\"</p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>Hash, Marihuana &amp; Hemp Museum</li>\\n<li>Prostitution in the Netherlands</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Prostitution Information Centre</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":154.5,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":15139334,\"title\":\"Esra Dalfidan\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Esra Dalfidan</b> was born in 1975, of Turkish parents, and raised in the German industrial town of Solingen.

Used by 260,000 passengers a day, it is the second-busiest railway station in the country after Utrecht Centraal and the most visited national heritage site of the Netherlands.</p>\\n<p>National and international railway services at Amsterdam Centraal are provided by NS, the principal rail operator in the Netherlands. Amsterdam Centraal is the northern terminus of Amsterdam Metro Routes 51, 53, and 54, operated by municipal public transport operator GVB. It is also served by a number of GVB tram and ferry routes as well as local and regional bus routes operated by GVB, Connexxion and EBS.</p>\\n<p>Amsterdam Centraal was designed by Dutch architect Pierre Cuypers and first opened in 1889. It features a Gothic/Renaissance Revival station building and a cast iron platform roof spanning approximately 40\\u00a0metres.</p>\\n<p>As it is situated in the city centre, Amsterdam Centraal is a major gateway for many of the city's tourist destinations including the Royal Palace, the UNESCO-listed canal belt, the Anne Frank House, and the Red-Light District. It is also within walking distance from the University of Amsterdam's innercity campus.</p>\\n<p>Since 1997, the station building, underground passages, metro station and the surrounding area have been undergoing major reconstruction and renovation works to accommodate the North-South Line metro route, which is due to open in 2017.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam Centraal was designed by Pierre Cuypers, who is also known for his design of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. While Cuypers was the principal architect, it is believed that he focused mostly on the decoration of the station building and left the structural design to railway engineers. The station was built by contractor Philipp Holzmann. The new central station replaced Amsterdam Willemspoort Station, which had closed in 1878, as well as the temporary Westerdok Station used from 1878 to 1889. The idea for a central station came from Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, then the Netherlands Minister of the Interior and responsible for the national railways, who, in 1884, laid two proposals before the Amsterdam municipal council. In the first proposal, the station would be situated between the Leidseplein and the Amstel river. In the other, it would be built in the open harbour front allowing for the station to be connected to the existing main lines in the area to the west and the south, but also to a projected new northern line.</p>\\n<p>Cuypers' design of the station building in many ways strongly resembled his other architectural masterpiece, the Rijksmuseum, of which the construction had begun in 1876. It features a palace-like, Gothic/Renaissance Revival facade, with two turrets and many ornamental details and stone reliefs referring to the capital city's industrial and commercial importance. Cuypers' station reflects the romantic nationalistic mood in the late nineteenth-century Netherlands, with its many decorative elements glorifying the nation's economic and colonial power at the time.</p>\\n<p>As with the Rijksmuseum, the station's overall architecture reminded many contemporaries of medieval cathedrals. For that reason, as well as for the fact that it became increasingly clear that the national government wanted the station to be built at the city's waterfront effectively separating the city from the IJ lake, the plan was highly controversial. In his book on the history of city, Amsterdam historian Geert Mak writes that:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Almost all of Amsterdam's own experts and others involved thought this to be a catastrophic plan, 'the most disgusting possible attack on the beauty and glory of the capital'. Nevertheless, the building of the Central Station in front of the open harbour was forced through by the railway department of the Ministry of Transport in The Hague, and the Home Secretary, Thorbecke. Finally, the plan made its way through the Amsterdam municipal council by a narrow majority.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Construction works started in 1882. The station is built on three interconnected artificial islands in the IJ lake. These islands were created with sand taken from the dunes near Velsen, which had become available as a result of the excavation of the North Sea Canal. The islands together are known as <i>Stationseiland</i> (Station Island). Like many other structures in Amsterdam, the station was built on wooden piles (8,687 pieces). The construction of the station was delayed because of the instability of the soil, which set back the completion of the work by several years. The station building was completed in 1884, but the commission to Cuypers did not include the roofwork of the platforms. Therefore, the station did not yet feature its distinctive station roof. This roof, consisting of 50 curved trusses and a span of almost 45 meters, was designed by L.J. Eijmer, a civil engineer with the private railroad company Staatsspoorwegen. The roof was manufactured by Andrew Handyside and Company of Derby, England. Cuypers did design the decorations for the trusses and the gable ends. On October 15, 1889, the station was officially opened, drawing large numbers of crowds. The visitors were charged 0.25 guilders to see the station; in the first two days after the opening, several dozens of thousands paid. The opening of the central station marked the city's transition from a waterfront city to an inland city, spurring further redevelopment activities in the city centre which included the realignment of streets and the filling up of canals. The waterways would soon be replaced by tramways and cars as the primary modes of transport in the city.</p>\\n<p>In 1920, the East Wing of the station (the lower end of building) was demolished and replaced by \\\"The East\\\", a postal service building designed by Cuypers' son Joseph. A second, narrower and longer but similar roof on the north side of the station was completed in 1922. In the 1950s, a pedestrian tunnel was created between the station and the road in front of it, which terminated inside the station. With the construction of the metro tunnel in the late 1970s, both the pedestrian tunnel and the road in front of the station disappeared. In the early 1980s, the central hall and middle tunnel were considerably widened and modernized. In the 1990s, a new signaling post was built on the western side of the station. In addition, the number of tracks on that side was expanded in order to increase capacity in the direction of Sloterdijk station. In 1996, a third, 'centre roof' designed by Jan Garvelink, architect at Holland Rail Consult, was built between the two existing roofs, whereby all platforms at the station were now covered.</p>\\n\\n<p>Since 1997, the station has been continuously under construction because of the development of the North-South Line of the Amsterdam Metro, which was originally planned to be completed in 2014. Due to several setbacks, some at the Amsterdam Centraal building site, the line is now expected to open fully in 2017. Construction works at the station include a renovation of the station building, including the reconstruction of original station features which had disappeared over the years, a redevelopment of the <i>Stationsplein</i> (Station Square), and a new bus station on the north side of the station. In 2000, the new western passenger tunnel opened replacing the main tunnel in the centre of the station which was shut down enabling the construction of the new metro line. In 2004, platforms 10-15 were extended to accommodate international high-speed rail services. Construction works for the bus station commenced in 2003 and were projected to be finished in 2014. It includes the construction of a fourth station roof and a station hall with space for shops and restaurants. It replaces 5 small bus stations and several isolated bus stops across the Station Island. In 2009, the partially finished bus station took into service. With all buses eventually moving to the new bus station on the north side, the Station Island should only be accessible to pedestrians, cyclists and trams.</p>\\n<p>The three passenger tunnels underneath the station were upgraded and provided with convenience stores and kiosks. In addition, two new passageways were created enabling the hosting of larger retail stores, geared towards passengers who have more time to spend at the station.</p>\\n<h2>Railway services</h2>\\n<p>Amsterdam Centraal is a terminus station on many historical railway lines in the Netherlands: the Amsterdam\\u2013Rotterdam railway (1839), also known as the <i>Oude Lijn</i>, via Haarlem, Leiden and Den Haag; the Den Helder\\u2013Amsterdam railway (1865), also known as the <i>Staatslijn K</i>, from Den Helder to Amsterdam via Alkmaar and Uitgeest; the Amsterdam-Zutphen railway (1874), also known as the <i>Oosterspoorweg</i>, via Hilversum, Amersfoort and Apeldoorn; the Amsterdam-Elten railway (1856), also known as the <i>Rhijnspoorweg</i>, via Utrecht and Arnhem; and the Amsterdam-Schiphol railway (1986), also known as the <i>Westtak Ringspoorbaan</i>.</p>\\n<p>As of 2014, Amsterdam Centraal is served by 12 international rail routes and 15 national rail routes.</p>\\n<h3>International rail</h3>\\n\\n\\n<h3>National rail</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>National rail services at the station are provided by NS, the principal rail operator in the Netherlands. NS offers four types of rail service from Amsterdam Centraal: Intercity Direct operating on the HSL-Zuid high-speed rail line, long-distance InterCity services, local <i>Sprinter</i> services, and the <i>Nachtnet</i> night service.</p>\\n<h2>Railway station layout</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam Centraal has fifteen tracks, eleven of which are alongside a platform: four island platforms with tracks along the full length on both sides (tracks 4/5, 7/8, 10/11, 13/14); one side platform with one track along the full length (track 15); and one bay platform (or side platform) with two tracks (tracks 1/2). All tracks along a platform have an A-side and a B-side, except for track 1. This means that there are 21 places where a train can be positioned for passenger access. One track has a side track along the full length (track 2); on the other side, there is track only at the west end (track 1; bay platform), along the rest of the platform is the station building. Tracks 3, 6, 9, and 12 have no platform.</p>\\n<p>Diagram (platforms are yellow, tunnels are grey, north is up):</p>\\n\\n<h2>Other transport</h2>\\n<h3>Metro services</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam Centraal metro station (called <i>Centraal Station</i> on the Amsterdam Metro system) opened in 1980.

In 2017, the new Route 52 (Noord Station - Zuid Station) is due to open, which will also call at Amsterdam Centraal.</p>\\n<p>The metro station is only accessible with an OV-chipkaart smart card, the national fare system for public transport in the Netherlands. Disposable cards for one-hour, one-day or multiple-day use are available at ticket machines in the metro station hall.</p>\\n<p>As of 2014, the following metro services call at Centraal Station:</p>\\n<h3>Tram services</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tram services at Amsterdam Centraal are provided from two tram stations on <i>Stationsplein</i> (Station Square), situated in front of the station's main entrance. Tram routes 1, 2, 5, 13 and 17 call on the west side (<i>Westzijde</i>, Platform B) of the square, the other routes call on the east side (<i>Oostzijde</i>, Platform A).</p>\\n<h3>Bus services</h3>\\n<h4>City services</h4>\\n\\n\\n<p>City bus services depart from platform C on the eastern side of <i>Stationsplein</i> (Station Square) and from Platform F, a bus station south of the square on the <i>Prins Hendrikkade</i>.</p>\\n<h4>City nightbuses</h4>\\n<p>Night bus services operate daily, starting around midnight and running until around 6am. From Monday to Thursday, night buses run once per hour. On Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, they run twice per hour.

Its notable buildings and frequent events make it one of the most well-known and important locations in the city.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Location and description</h2>\\n\\n<p>Dam Square lies in the historical center of Amsterdam, approximately 750 meters south of the main transportation hub, Centraal Station, at the original location of the dam in the river Amstel. It is roughly rectangular in shape, stretching about 200 meters from west to east and about 100 meters from north to south. It links the streets Damrak and Rokin, which run along the original course of the Amstel River from Centraal Station to Muntplein (Mint Square) and the Munttoren (Mint Tower). The Dam also marks the endpoint of the other well-traveled streets Nieuwendijk, Kalverstraat and Damstraat. A short distance beyond the northeast corner lies the main red-light district: de Wallen.</p>\\n<p>On the west end of the square is the neoclassical Royal Palace, which served as the city hall from 1655 until its conversion to a royal residence in 1808. Beside it are the 15th-century Gothic Nieuwe Kerk (New Church) and the Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum. The National Monument, a white stone pillar designed by J.J.P. Oud and erected in 1956 to memorialize the victims of World War II, dominates the opposite side of the square. Also overlooking the plaza are the NH Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky and the upscale department store De Bijenkorf. These various attractions have turned the Dam into a tourist zone.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Dam derives its name from its original function: a dam on the Amstel River, hence also the name of the city. Built in approximately 1270, the dam formed the first connection between the settlements on the sides of the river.</p>\\n<p>As the dam was gradually built up it became wide enough for a town square, which remained the core of the town developing around it. Dam Square as it exists today grew out of what was originally two squares: the actual dam, called <i>Middeldam</i>; and <i>Plaetse</i>, an adjacent plaza to the west. A large fish market arose where ships moored at the dam to load and unload goods. The area became a centre not only of commercial activity but also of the government, as the site of Amsterdam's town hall.</p>\\n<p>As a market square, the Dam had a weigh house that can be seen in some old paintings. It was demolished in 1808 by order of Louis Bonaparte who, upon taking up residence in the newly converted Royal Palace, complained that his view was obstructed.</p>\\n<p>The Damrak, or the former mouth of the Amstel River, was partially filled in the 19th century; since then, the Dam square has been surrounded by land on all sides. The new land made room for the Beurs van Zocher, a stock exchange that was built in 1837. After the stock trade moved to the Beurs van Berlage in 1903, the Zocher building was demolished. In its place, De Bijenkorf department store has stood since 1914.</p>\\n<p>In 1856, a war memorial named <i>De Eendracht</i> (The Unity) was unveiled inside the square before King William III. A stone column with a female statue on top, the monument acquired the nickname \\\"Naatje of the Dam\\\". It was taken down in 1914.</p>\\n<h2>Dam Square shooting, 1945</h2>\\n\\n<p>On 7 May 1945, two days after German capitulation, thousands of Dutch people were waiting for Canadian troops to arrive on the Dam square in Amsterdam. In the <i>Grote Club</i>, on the corner of the Kalverstraat and the Paleisstraat, members of the Kriegsmarine watched as the crowd below their balcony grew and people danced and cheered. The Germans then placed a machinegun on the balcony and started shooting into the crowds. The motives behind the shooting have remained unclear; the Germans were drunk and possibly angered because contrary to previous agreement Dutch police had arrested members of the German military.</p>\\n<p>The shooting finally came to an end after a member of the resistance climbed into the tower of the royal palace and started shooting onto the balcony and into the Club. At that moment, a German officer together with a Resistance commander found their way into the Club and convinced the men to surrender. At the brink of peace, 120 people were badly injured and 22 pronounced dead. In 2013, evidence was brought to light that suggested the number may have been higher: possibly 33 people died, and there were 10 more unconfirmed possible victims. Investigation of this shooting on this site with reports, names of victims: http://de-dam-zevenmei1945.nl</p>\\n<h2>Present</h2>\\n\\n<p>Several tram lines traverse the Dam and have stops there. In the time of the horse tram (end 19th century) the Dam was the most important tram hub of Amsterdam. After 1900 this function moved to the Central Station, at the other end of the Damrak.</p>\\n<p>Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, Amsterdam's main square became a \\\"national\\\" square well known to nearly everyone in the Netherlands. It has frequently been the location of demonstrations and events of all kinds, and a meeting place for many people. On 4 May every year, the Dutch celebrate National Memorial Day (<i>Nationale Dodenherdenking</i>), in observance of which the last addition to the square, the National Monument, was set up in 1956.</p>\\n<p>A funfair is held on Dam Square several times a year, such as on King's Day and around Christmas.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>360-degree panorama of the Dam</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":471.6,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":100384,\"title\":\"Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Willem-Alexander</b> (<small>pronounced</small> [&#712;&#651;&#618;l&#601;m &#593;l&#603;&#712;ks&#593;nd&#601;r]; Willem-Alexander Claus George Ferdinand; born 27 April 1967) is the King of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, consisting of the countries of the Netherlands (including the Caribbean Netherlands), Cura&#231;ao, Aruba, and Sint Maarten.

The conflagration destroyed the Hotel Polen (<i>Hotel Poland</i>), a five story hotel in the centre of the city which had been built in 1891, as well as the furniture store on the ground level and a nearby bookstore. Many of the tourists who stayed at the hotel (of which the majority were Swedes) jumped to their deaths trying to escape the flames. Upon their arrival, the fire department used a life net to help people escape, but not everyone could be saved. The incident resulted in 33 deaths and 21 severe injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.</p>\\n<p>The hotel was located between the Kalverstraat (no. 15-17) and the Rokin (no. 14), near the present day Madame Tussauds. Its place is now occupied by the Rokin Plaza, which was originally an office building, today it houses several fashion shops. The Polish-born artist Ania Bien created a photographic installation based on the fire in 1986, which compared it to the Holocaust.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Background</h2>\\n<p>In the beginning of the 16th century, there was an inn on the site where the Hotel Polen was later located. At the end of the 18th century, the <i>\\\"Poolsche Koffiehuis\\\"</i> (<i>Polish Coffee House</i>) was established, which began offering guest accommodation in 1857. In 1891, the Hotel Polen was established by the <i>\\\"Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van het Poolsche Koffiehuis\\\"</i> (<i>Polish Coffee House Society</i>), after the adjacent space on the Rokin was bought, and a building was constructed there which was possibly designed by the architect Pierre Cuypers, who also designed the Amsterdam Central Station and the Rijksmuseum. Another source lists Eduard Cuypers as the architect. The hotel was five stories high and on the ground level of the building a caf\\u00e9-restaurant was opened.</p>\\n<p>The Hotel Polen was once known as a fashionable place to stay. The caf\\u00e9-restaurant was closed at the end of 1974 and its location was subsequently rented to the furniture store Inden. The hotel remained open as a part of the Krasnapolsky Concern.</p>\\n<p>The building, including the load-bearing elements, was constructed of wood. There were 10 fire extinguishers and 11 fire hoses in the hotel. Only a few escape routes had proper emergency lighting and directions to the emergency exits, and the hotel was also not on a hotline with the emergency centre of the fire department. The building had been inspected by the fire department, first in February 1976, and later in the beginning of 1977, after which the hotel's management was notified in writing that there were severe fire safety defects. They issued a list of proposed improvements to be implemented by the hotel, such as complying with the building regulations and the regulations for residence facilities.</p>\\n<h2>The fire</h2>\\n\\n<p>On the night of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, including a large group of Swedish tourists. About 6:20\\u00a0am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the caf\\u00e9-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.</p>\\n<p>By 6:30\\u00a0am the fire was spreading very quickly through the building, although from the outside nothing was visible. Because of the wooden construction, the building was soon engulfed in flames. The guests on the top level could not escape and stood panicked in the windows. When the fire reached the rooms of some guests, they leaped out of the windows to escape. At 6:42 the first large fire engine arrived. On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire. The fire fighters tried to fold out a life net in the Papenbroekssteeg (which runs between the Rokin and the Kalverstraat) but the alley was too narrow for it.</p>\\n<p>On the front side, on the Rokin, the rescue operations of the fire department were also hampered. There were so many people standing on the window ledges screaming that the fire fighters did not know who to save first. Time was also lost because some people threw their luggage in the life net and then jumped into it themselves, causing injuries. Some people fell to the side of the net and were severely injured. Just before 7:00\\u00a0am the part of the hotel which faced the Kalverstraat collapsed. The burning debris landed on the fire engine in the Kalverstraat, and the fire fighters barely escaped to safety. The nearby book store was also burned out and fires broke out in several buildings on the other side of the Kalverstraat, which were quickly brought under control.</p>\\n<p>At about 8:30\\u00a0am the wooden construction of the main part of the building also burned through and collapsed. Despite the fact that there were still people in the building and more people were lying around the building severely injured, the fire fighters decided to withdraw. The fire department proceeded to extinguish the smoking debris, and at 9:30\\u00a0am the fire was declared under control. The building's collapse left a gaping hole; of the hotel, the furniture store and the book store, almost nothing remained.</p>\\n<p>The disaster caused the deaths of 33 people: 32 tourists (17 of them were Swedes) and the occupant of the apartment above the book store. Eighteen charred bodies were recovered from the debris. Thirteen people, who had jumped from windows, either died or were severely injured. Among the dead was the celebrated German concert musician and composer Walter Kraft, longtime organist of St. Mary's Church, L\\u00fcbeck. Of the 57 people who were injured, 21 had severe injuries. Two American guests escaped without injury.</p>\\n<h2>Possible cause</h2>\\n\\n<p>The cause of the fire could not be determined with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, and the opening of the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, there was no evidence of a burglary.</p>\\n<p>The high number of casualties was a consequence of the wooden construction of the building, the poorly marked escape routes and the shortage of safety equipment.</p>\\n<h2>Cultural impact</h2>\\n<p>Polish-born artist Ania Bien produced a photographic art installation in 1986 called \\\"Hotel Polen\\\".

The church played an important part in the life of Rembrandt and was the subject of a painting by Claude Monet.</p>\\n<p>The Zuiderkerk was the city's first church built specifically for Protestant services. It was constructed between 1603 and 1611 and stands on the Zuiderkerkhof (\\\"Southern Graveyard\\\") square near the Sint Antoniesbreestraat. The distinctive church tower, which dominates the surrounding area, was not completed until 1614 and contains a carillon of bells built by the brothers Hemony, installed in 1656 along with four bells which are rang monthly.</p>\\n<p>The design of the church in Amsterdam Renaissance style is by Hendrick de Keyser, who was also buried in the church in 1621. A memorial stone was placed on top of his tomb in 1921. De Keyser designed the church as a pseudo-basilica in Gothic style, with a central nave and two lower side aisles, six bays long, with Tuscan columns, timber barrel vaults and dormers. The stained glass in the rectangular windows was replaced by transparent glass in the 17th Century. The richly detailed tower is a square stone substructure, on which an octagonal sandstone section stands with free-standing columns on the corners. On top of this is a wooden, lead-covered spire.</p>\\n<p>French Impressionist painter Claude Monet painted the church during a visit to the Netherlands. There is some confusion about the date of this painting, but it was probably one of 12 paintings made by Monet in 1874 during a visit to Amsterdam. The composition is centred on the church spire, with the Groenburgwal canal leading up to it in the foreground. The reflections of the buildings on the water are represented by yellow brushstrokes only, with no detail to them. The painting now hangs in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p>\\n<p>Three of Rembrandt's children were buried in the Zuiderkerk, which is very near to Rembrandt's house in the Jodenbreestraat. Ferdinand Bol, one of Rembrandt's most famous pupils, was buried in the Zuiderkerk in 1680. According to local legend, Rembrandt painted the <i>Night Watch</i> at the church because his own studio was too small. However, the story is highly disputed and most likely untrue.</p>\\n<p>The Zuiderkerk was used for church services until 1929. During the final (1944-1945) winter of World War II, known as the <i>hongerwinter</i> (\\\"hunger winter\\\") in the Netherlands because food was so scarce, the church was in use as a temporary morgue because people were dying faster than they could be buried. The church was closed in 1970 because it was at the point of collapse. In the years 1976-1979, the church underwent renovation, and since 1988 it serves as a municipal information centre, with regularly changing exhibitions as well as a permanent exhibition which features a scale model of Amsterdam as it is envisioned in 2020.</p>\\n<p>Since June 2006, the church also houses the \\\"Wall of Fame\\\", a homage to Dutch celebrities who have made a positive contribution to society, such as charitable work.

The building became the royal palace of King Louis Napoleon and later of the Dutch Royal House. It is situated on the west side of Dam Square in the centre of Amsterdam, opposite the War Memorial and next to the Nieuwe Kerk.</p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>Town hall</h3>\\n<p>The palace was built as the Town Hall of the City of Amsterdam and was opened as such on 29 July 1655 by Cornelis de Graeff, the mayor of Amsterdam. It was built by Jacob van Campen, who took control of the construction project in 1648. It was built on 13,659 wooden piles and cost 8.5 million gulden. A yellowish sandstone from Bentheim in Germany was used for the entire building. The stone has darkened considerably in the course of time. Marble was the chosen material for the interior.</p>\\n<p>Jacob van Campen was inspired by Roman administrative palalces and public buildings. He wanted to build a new capitol for the Amsterdam burgomasters who thought of themselves as the consuls of the new Rome of the North. The technical implementation was looked after by the town construction master Dani\\u00ebl Stalpaert. The sculptures were executed by Artus Quellijn.</p>\\n\\n<p>The central hall is 120 feet long, 60 feet wide and 90 feet high. On the marble floor there are two maps of the world with a celestial hemisphere. The Western and Eastern hemispheres are shown on the maps. The hemispheres detail the area of Amsterdam's colonial influence. The terrestrial hemispheres were made in the mid-18th century. They replaced an earlier pair made in the late 1650s. The originals showed the regions explored by the Dutch East India Company's ships in the first half of the 17th century. This feature may have been inspired by the map of the Roman Empire that had been engraved on marble and placed in the Porticus Vipsania, a public building in ancient Rome.</p>\\n<p>On top of the palace is a large domed cupola, topped by a weather vane in the form of a cog ship. This ship is a symbol of Amsterdam. Just underneath the dome there are a few windows. From here one could see the ships arrive and leave the harbour.</p>\\n<p>The interiors, focusing on the power and prestige of Amsterdam, were completed later.</p>\\n<p>Paintings inside include works by Govert Flinck (who died before finishing a cycle of twelve huge canvases), Jacob Jordaens, Jan Lievens and Ferdinand Bol. Rembrandt's largest work, The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis was commissioned for the building, but after hanging for some months was returned to him; the remaining fragment is now in Stockholm.</p>\\n<p>In its time the building was one of many candidates for the title of the Eighth Wonder of the World. Also, for a long time it was the largest administrative building in Europe.</p>\\n<h3>Palace</h3>\\n\\n<p>After the patriot revolution which swept the House of Orange from power a decade earlier, the new Batavian Republic was forced to accept Louis Napoleon, brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, as King Louis I of Holland in 1806. After holding his court at The Hague and Utrecht, Louis Napoleon moved to Amsterdam, and converted the Town Hall into a royal palace for himself.</p>\\n<p>The King of Holland did not have long to appreciate his new palace. He abdicated on 2 July 1810; his son, Napoleon Louis Bonaparte, then succeeded him, as King Louis II, before the Netherlands were annexed by France ten days later. The palace then became home to the French governor, Charles Fran\\u00e7ois Lebrun.</p>\\n\\n<p>Prince William VI (son of Prince William V of Orange), returned to the Netherlands in 1813, after Napoleon fell from power, and restored the palace to its original owners. After his investiture as King William I of the Netherlands, however, Amsterdam was made the official capital of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (the seats of government being Brussels and The Hague). The new King realised the importance of having a palace in the capital, and the Town Hall again became a royal palace.</p>\\n<p>It was made property of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1936. On 27 December 1949, the palace's central hall (<i>Burgerzaal)</i> was the scene of the official ceremony for the transfer of sovereignty over Indonesia by the Netherlands (<i>Soevereiniteitsoverdracht</i>), represented by Queen Juliana and Indonesian vice-president Muhammad Hatta.</p>\\n<p>The palace is used by the monarch for entertaining and official functions during state visits and other official receptions, such as New Year receptions. The award ceremonies of the Erasmus Prize, of the Silver Carnation, of the Royal Awards for Painting, and of the Prince Claus Award are also held in the palace.</p>\\n\\n<p>The balcony of the Royal Palace was used during the investiture of Queen Beatrix in 1980, where her mother Juliana announced the new Queen to the people. The then-Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess M\\u00e1xima kissed on the balcony on their wedding day on 2 February 2002.</p>\\n<p>The palace was renovated from 2005 until June 2009, during which, among other things, asbestos was removed. Since 14 June 2009, the Palace is open again to visitors.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Official website</li>\\n<li>The Royal Palace, Amsterdam at the website of the Dutch Royal House</li>\\n<li>(Dutch) Paleis op de Dam at the website of the Monuments &amp; Archeology Agency of the City of Amsterdam</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":550,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":28625998,\"title\":\"Ella Kalsbeek\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Neeltje Adriana (Ella) Kalsbeek</b> (born 5 January 1955 in Middelburg) is a former Dutch politician.

The Conservatorium van Amsterdam (CVA) is the largest music academy in the Netherlands, offering programs in classical music, jazz, pop, early music, music education, and opera.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The oldest predecessor of the Conservatorium van Amsterdam was founded in 1884 as the Amsterdamsch Conservatorium, four years before the completion of the Concertgebouw. In 1920 a competing music academy was established in Amsterdam by a society called 'Muzieklyceum'. The Bachzaal, used by the Amsterdamsch Conservatorium, was completed in 1931.</p>\\n<p>In 1976, the Amsterdamsch Conservatorium, Conservatory of the Muzieklyceum Society, and the Haarlems Muzieklyceum merged to form the Sweelinck Conservatorium. This \\\"new\\\" academy of music moved to the former savings bank building in the Van Baerlestraat in 1985. In 1994 the Sweelinck Conservatorium merged with Hilversums Conservatorium to form the Conservatorium van Amsterdam. Since 1998 its training programmes take place in their facilities in Van Baerlestraat and the Nieuwe Vaart. In 2008 the school moved to Oosterdokseiland.</p>\\n<h2>Building</h2>\\n<p>Since April 21, 2008, the Conservatorium van Amsterdam has its home in a new building at the Oosterdokseiland, near Amsterdam Central Station. The new building is centrally located in a cultural area, including the 'Muziekgebouw' with three concert halls for classical music and jazz, and the public library. Other faculties of the Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten (Amsterdam School of the Arts) are within walking distance.</p>\\n<p>This new complex is designed and equipped to current standards. Students can organize solo or ensemble concerts, create interesting projects with other music students or students from other art disciplines. They also make their own posters and flyers, sell tickets, or record their concerts in one of the concert halls and broadcast them on the internet radio at the CvA website.</p>\\n<p>The design, by Dutch architect Frits van Dongen, is based on the 'Engawa model', the Japanese way of building, where the corridors are situated next to the outer walls of the building and the concert halls, classrooms and study rooms, within. Large windows in the front transmits sufficient daylight into the rooms. This building method is intended to enable students to study without being disturbed, while corridors keep noises out.</p>\\n<p>The new building contains three units. At ground level there are four halls:</p>\\n<ul><li>Bernard Haitinkzaal, a large hall with 450 seats</li>\\n<li>Amsterdam Blue Note, a hall for jazz and pop concerts, which seats 200</li>\\n<li>Sweelinckzaal, a recital hall with 120 seats</li>\\n<li>Theaterzaal, which seats 50</li>\\n</ul><p>The Bernard Haitinkzaal and Sweelinckzaal have windows which transmit daylight, which is exceptional for a concert hall. All halls have recording equipment, so that each concert or playing exam can be recorded. There is also a foyer and a canteen at ground level.</p>\\n<p>At the next level there are four floors with lesson and classrooms and on top of these there are two floors with the library, a lecture hall and study rooms.</p>\\n<p>Acoustic planning was by Akoestisch bureau Peutz, who researched the acoustic requirements of the lesson and study rooms and concert halls.</p>\\n<h2>Faculty</h2>\\n<h3>Current</h3>\\n\\n<h3>Emiriti</h3>\\n\\n<h2>Alumni</h2>\\n<dl><dd><i>For a full list, see Category:Conservatorium van Amsterdam alumni</i></dd>\\n</dl>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Official Website in Dutch</li>\\n<li>Official Website in English</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":735.5,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":44119428,\"title\":\"Fong Leng\",\"text\":\"<p>In 1975 the Centraal Museum in Utrecht was the first museum to collect Fong Leng&#8217;s work.

This former clergyman was invited in 1877 to occupy the chair of Aesthetics, Art History, and Modern Languages at the newly founded university.

At his death in 1926, the university had interest in acquiring his collection. In 1932, Pierson's son Jan Lodewijk established the Allard Pierson Foundation in order to make the antiquities collection available for research and teaching. The collection was brought to a building on the Weesperzijde in Amsterdam, with the top floor serving as a museum.</p>\\n<p>The collection grew due to purchases, gifts, and loans of artifacts and documents.

Tributary rivers are the Kromme Mijdrecht, Bullewijk and Waver.</p>\\n<p>The river's mouth is in Amsterdam, where it meets the IJ bay.

It has an area of roughly 0.05 km\\u00b2.</p>\\n<h2>Places named after the river</h2>\\n<p>Amsterdam took its name from the river. The city developed out of a small fishing village called <i>Amstelredam</i>, built in the 13th century alongside a dam at the mouth of the river. The town was granted city rights around 1300. The hamlet developed into the small town <i>Amsteldam</i>, which later became Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p>The area through which the river passes is known as the Amstelland. The city and municipality of Amstelveen, the municipality of Ouder-Amstel, the towns of Ouderkerk aan de Amstel and Nes aan de Amstel are all named after the river as well. Amsterdam has a street called Amstel (along the river), a square called Amstelveld and a train station called Amsterdam Amstel.</p>\\n<p>In the former Dutch colonies in North America, a town was captured from the Swedes in 1655 and renamed Nieuw-Amstel (\\\"New Amstel\\\").

AUP explicitly supports open access, and combines in its publishing policy the use of repositories and print-on-demand provisions with traditional printing.</p>\\n<h2>Areas of publishing</h2>\\n<p>AUP's stocklist currently comprises different academic disciplines, including language and literature, archaeology, management studies, cultural studies, film and media, art and art history, music and theatre studies, as well as social sciences, ranging from migration and integration to Asian studies. In addition, AUP is active in educational publishing for high school and higher education, as well as popular science.</p>\\n<h2>Imprints</h2>\\n<p>There are various imprints linked to AUP. Vossiuspers UvA publishes the works of the University of Amsterdam\\u2019s scholarse. Moreover, all inaugural lectures of UvA professors appear under this imprint. And in 2004, under the name Pallas Publications, AUP began a new service allowing authors, institutions, and organizations the opportunity to have their academic publications produced, distributed, and promoted.</p>\\n<h2>Open access publishing in European networks</h2>\\n<p>Since 2007, AUP has been active on a European level, as the coordinator of \\\"Open Access Publishing in European Networks\\\", backed by the European Commission.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Official website</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":814.1,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":2101527,\"title\":\"Job Cohen\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Marius Job Cohen</b> (<small>Dutch pronunciation:</small> [&#712;ma&#720;rij&#655;s &#712;j&#596;p ko&#712;&#614;&#603;n]; born 18 October 1947) is a Dutch social democratic politician and former legal scholar.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Job_Cohen_2010.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q381657\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":0}],\"type\":\"landmark\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Yab_Yum_Amsterdam.jpg\",\"title\":\"Yab Yum (brothel)\",\"lon\":4.8886111111111,\"wikidata\":\"Q1822492\",\"lat\":52.370680555556,\"pageid\":9317131,\"ns\":0,\"extract\":\"<p><b>Yab Yum</b> was one of the best-known and most exclusive brothels in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Located in a 17th-century canal house on the Singel, it mostly catered to businessmen and foreign visitors. A second Yab Yum operated for a while in Rotterdam, but has since been closed.</p>\\n<p>In January 2008, the city of Amsterdam closed the brothel by revoking its license, alleging that it was being used for criminal activity.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Operation</h2>\\n<p>As of 2005, the entrance fee was 70 euros, which included a drink. Sex for one hour cost 300 euros, but typically also required the purchase of an expensive bottle of champagne.</p>\\n<p>From its beginning in the 1980s until the legalisation of brothels in 2000, the Yab Yum operated as a \\\"licenced club with no members\\\" and was tolerated according to police guidelines, as long as no drugs and no violence was involved. The club advertised in student newspapers to find employees.</p>\\n<p>In 1997, it was reported that a woman earned up to $10,000 per month working at Yab Yum, tax free. Anticipating stricter regulation, the club agreed to pay taxes for its 55 employees starting 1 January 1998.</p>\\n<p>In anticipation of the official legalisation of brothels on 1 October 2000, Yab Yum owner Theo Heuft applied to open a \\\"relax service\\\" at the Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, to offer exclusive food, drink and massages to travellers. When he was turned down, he filed a lawsuit. The airport brothel was never opened.</p>\\n<p>In an interview in <i>Millionair Magazine</i> in February 2008, Heuft said that the brothel made its best ever earnings, just over 40,000 euros, on the evening in 1985 when the Dutch football team beat Cyprus 7-1 in Amsterdam. He complained about the \\\"dreadful\\\" atmosphere caused by the \\\"ordinary clientele\\\" that night.</p>\\n<h2>Ownership and scandals</h2>\\n<p>The club has repeatedly been mentioned in connection with corruption affairs. In 1998 it was alleged that a director of a brokerage house regularly obtained insider information by inviting senior executives to Yab Yum. In 2002 a former manager of a building company alleged that civil servants were commonly bribed with visits to Yab Yum.</p>\\n<p>In 1990 the major drug trafficker Klaas Bruinsma and his associate Roy Adkins fought in the club after one of their operations had gone sour; shots were fired but nobody was injured and nobody talked to the police. Adkins was assassinated later that year and Bruinsma was shot to death in 1991.</p>\\n<p>A newspaper article in 2006 reported that true ownership of the brothel had long been in the hands of mafia figures, beginning with Klaas Bruinsma, who called it \\\"the club house\\\". After Bruinsma's death, his associates Sam Klepper and John Mieremet took over, along with the Dutch Hells Angels. Klepper was murdered in 2000; Mieremet survived an assassination attempt in 2002 but was murdered in 2005.</p>\\n<h2>Closure</h2>\\n<p>In November 2007 it was reported that the city of Amsterdam was trying to close the brothel by revoking its license, alleging without going into details that it was being used for criminal activity. This was part of a larger campaign of mayor Job Cohen to reduce the number of sex businesses operating in the city center. Closure was done with the Bibob act which does not require proof of criminal activities or criminal connections: reasonably strong indications are sufficient.</p>\\n<p>Yab Yum appealed the revocation of the license. At court, the city's lawyer alleged that owner Hennie Vittali was a front man for the Hells Angels, who had taken over the club in 1999 following blackmail and threats, buying it for \\u20ac1.8m although the market price was put at \\u20ac9m. On 4 January 2008 the court confirmed the action of the city. In a public statement, the brothel denied any connection with the Hells Angels and vowed to appeal the ruling. The brothel closed on 7 January 2008. On 15 January 2008 a higher court confirmed the decision; Yab Yum lost its license and will remain closed.</p>\\n<p>On 3 April 2010 an offer was announced; sex club owner Hennie Vittali was asking \\u20ac6m for the name and property.</p>\\n<h2>Yab Yum Unlocked, the Yab Yum Museum</h2>\\n<p>The Yab Yum building has been bought for 3 million euros and the brand for 1 million euro by entrepreneur Chris Kraijpoel. in 2011 He has applied for a new licence to reopen the brothel and meanwhile is exploiting the Yab Yum as a museum.</p>\\n<p>In September 2013, the original Yab Yum was reopened as a museum for the public.

However, plans for the new city hall were delayed again by budget constraints, as were the opera house plans.</p>\\n<p>In 1979, it was proposed that the city hall and opera house should be combined into one complex.

Situated on the Amstel near the Halvemaansteeg, the building offers a stage for both upcoming and established Dutch talents. The theatre has 503 seats.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History of the building</h2>\\n<p>The first theatre built in Amsterdam was the Schouwburg of Van Campen on Keizersgracht 384 in 1637, which burned down in 1772. That theatre company then moved to the Leidseplein, where it built a theatre in 1774, the first Stadsschouwburg. That building burned down in 1892 (the present building was built in 1894), making De Kleine Komedie the oldest surviving theatre in Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p>In 1784 Henry Hope of Hope &amp; Co. purchased ground on the Amstel near the east side of the Halvemaansteeg in Amsterdam, together with his fellow banker friends Balthazar Elias Abbema, Pieter de Smeth, Henry Fizeaux, Jean Alexander Botereau, and Pieter Muilman. They commissioned the building to the architect Abraham van der Hart who completed it in 1788. The commissioners were all very influential men of Amsterdam who had far reaching connections. Henry Fizeaux was a banker who had close ties with John Adams and Benjamin Franklin. He tried to raise funds for the American cause and shared revolutionary sympathies, though merchant tradition was to deny political preferences. The 'Patriotic' or 'Anti-Orange' sympathies of the directors Henry Fizeaux and Jean Alexander Botereau resulted in their stepping down in 1787 when the House of Orange was re-established. Orangist Henry Hope took over the running of the establishment until he fled the country before Napoleon's army in 1794.</p>\\n<h3>Th\\u00e9\\u00e2tre Fran\\u00e7ais</h3>\\n<p>It was called the Th\\u00e9\\u00e2tre Fran\\u00e7ais sur l'Erwtemarkt in 1784, the year performances began. In those days, the performances were often in French and modelled on a Parisian theater form that was very popular. Napoleon himself supported the Th\\u00e9\\u00e2tre Fran\\u00e7ais, and French opera's and plays were shown in the theatre well into the 19th century.</p>\\n<p>When the interest in French plays decreased, the building was sold to the 'Neues Deutsches Theater' that performed German plays. In 1856 the building came into the hands of the Free Church of Scotland and was rechristened 'Scottish Missionary Church'. The driving force behind the Dutch branch of this church was the Rev. August Ferdinand Carl Schwartz (1817\\u20131870), the father of the novelist Maarten Maartens.</p>\\n<p>When the Vrije Universiteit (Free University) of Amsterdam started in 1880, it hired some rooms in the Scottish Missionary Church and used them as lecture rooms. Here the founder Abraham Kuyper and his four co-professors gave their lectures. In 1883 the Scottish Missionary Church became too small for the quickly growing number of students and the university bought another building.</p>\\n<p>In the first half of Twentieth Century the building was called Salvatori and was used as a meeting centre. The most various groups met here, from orthodox Protestants to leftist freethinkers. During the Second World War the building was no more than a bicycle shed.</p>\\n<h3>De Kleine Komedie</h3>\\n<p>In 1947 the building was reopened as a theatre, now under its present name 'De Kleine Komedie'. Since then its program is primarily in Dutch. In the Fifties and Sixties many famous people in the Dutch entertainment world, like Toon Hermans, Wim Kan and Fons Jansen, made appearances in this theatre. In 1973 the building was closed by the Amsterdam fire brigade due to fire hazard. After a renovation financed by private sources, it was reopened in 1978.</p>\\n<p>In 1988 the continued existence of De Kleine Komedie was put in danger again, when the municipality of Amsterdam wanted to withdraw its subsidy. A campaign launched by the cabaret performer Youp van 't Hek secured the theatre's subsidy.</p>\\n<p>Because of its cosy atmosphere De Kleine Komedie is often used for try-out performances by upcoming talents as well as long-established cabaret performers. Many DVD and TV productions are recorded here.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Official site (site in Dutch)</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\"},{\"dim\":10000,\"dist\":899.9,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":59654,\"title\":\"Xaviera Hollander\",\"text\":\"<p>In her early 20s, she left Amsterdam for Johannesburg, where her stepsister lived.

Amsterdam's main attractions, including its historic canals, the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum, Hermitage Amsterdam, Anne Frank House, Amsterdam Museum, its red-light district, and its many cannabis coffee shops draw more than 3.66\\u00a0million international visitors annually.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n\\n<h3>Etymology</h3>\\n\\n<p>After the floods of 1170 and 1173 locals of the river Amstel vicinity built a bridge over- and a dam across the river, hence giving its name to the village: \\\"Aemstelredamme\\\". The earliest recorded use of the name \\\"Aemstelredamme\\\" (Amsterdam) comes from a document dated October 27, 1275. Inhabitants of the village, by this document, were exempted from paying a bridge toll in the County of Holland by Count Floris V.  This meant it had been allowed to the inhabitants of the village of Aemstelredamme to travel freely through the County of Holland without having to pay toll at bridges, locks and dams all through the county. The certificate describes the inhabitants as <i>homines manentes apud Amestelledamme</i> (people living near <i>Amestelledamme</i>). By 1327, the name had developed into <i>Aemsterdam</i>.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Founding and Middle Ages</h3>\\n<p>Amsterdam's founding is relatively recent compared with much older Dutch cities such as Nijmegen, Rotterdam, and Utrecht. In October 2008, historical geographer Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed as early as the late 10th century. This does not necessarily mean that there was already a settlement then since reclamation of land may not have been for farming\\u2014it may have been for peat, used as fuel.</p>\\n<p>Amsterdam was granted city rights in either 1300 or 1306. From the 14th century on, Amsterdam flourished, largely because of trade with the Hanseatic League. In 1345, an alleged Eucharistic miracle in the Kalverstraat rendered the city an important place of pilgrimage until the adoption of the Protestant faith. The <i>Stille Omgang</i>\\u2014a silent procession in civil attire\\u2014is today a remnant of the rich pilgrimage history.</p>\\n<h3>Conflict with Spain</h3>\\n<p>In the 16th century, the Dutch rebelled against Philip II of Spain and his successors. The main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes, the tenth penny, and the religious persecution of Protestants by the Spanish Inquisition. The revolt escalated into the Eighty Years' War, which ultimately led to Dutch independence. Strongly pushed by Dutch Revolt leader William the Silent, the Dutch Republic became known for its relative religious tolerance. Jews from the Iberian Peninsula, Huguenots from France, prosperous merchants and printers from Flanders, and economic and religious refugees from the Spanish-controlled parts of the Low Countries found safety in Amsterdam. The influx of Flemish printers and the city's intellectual tolerance made Amsterdam a centre for the European free press.</p>\\n<h3>Center of the Dutch Golden Age</h3>\\n\\n<p>The 17th century is considered Amsterdam's <i>Golden Age</i>, during which it became the wealthiest city in the world. Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the Baltic Sea, North America, and Africa, as well as present-day Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil, forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became Dutch colonies. Amsterdam was Europe's most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading Financial Centre of the world. In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the Dutch East India Company became the world's first stock exchange by trading in its own shares.</p>\\n<h3>Decline and modernization</h3>\\n<p>Amsterdam's prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The wars of the Dutch Republic with England and France took their toll on Amsterdam. During the Napoleonic Wars, Amsterdam's significance reached its lowest point, with Holland being absorbed into the French Empire. However, the later establishment of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815 marked a turning point.</p>\\n\\n<p>The end of the 19th century is sometimes called Amsterdam's second Golden Age. New museums, a train station, and the Concertgebouw were built; in this same time, the Industrial Revolution reached the city. The Amsterdam-Rhine Canal was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the Rhine, and the North Sea Canal was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the North Sea. Both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of Europe and the world. In 1906, Joseph Conrad gave a brief description of Amsterdam as seen from the seaside, in <i>The Mirror of the Sea</i>.</p>\\n<h3>Twentieth century</h3>\\n<p>Shortly before the First World War, the city began expanding, and new suburbs were built. Even though the Netherlands remained neutral in this war, Amsterdam suffered a food shortage, and heating fuel became scarce. The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed. These riots are known as the <i>Aardappeloproer</i> (Potato rebellion). People started looting stores and warehouses in order to get supplies, mainly food.</p>\\n\\n<p>After landflood in 1916 the depleted municipalities, Durgerdam, Holysloot, Zunderdorp and Schellingwoude, all lying north of Amsterdam, were, on their own request, annexed to the city on 1-1-1921.</p>\\n<p>Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940 and took control of the country. Some Amsterdam citizens sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to the high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. More than 100,000 Dutch Jews were deported to Nazi concentration camps of which some 60.000 lived in Amsterdam. Perhaps the most famous deportee was the young Jewish girl Anne Frank, who died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. At the end of the Second World War, communication with the rest of the country broke down, and food and fuel became scarce. Many citizens traveled to the countryside to forage. Dogs, cats, raw sugar beets, and Tulip bulbs\\u2014cooked to a pulp\\u2014were consumed to stay alive. Most of the trees in Amsterdam were cut down for fuel, and all the wood was taken from the apartments of deported Jews.</p>\\n\\n<p>Many new suburbs, such as Osdorp, Slotervaart, <i>Slotermeer</i>, and <i>Geuzenveld</i>, were built in the years after the Second World War. These suburbs contained many public parks and wide, open spaces, and the new buildings provided improved housing conditions with larger and brighter rooms, gardens, and balconies. Because of the war and other incidents of the 20th century, almost the entire city centre had fallen into disrepair. As society was changing, politicians and other influential figures made plans to redesign large parts of it. There was an increasing demand for office buildings and new roads as the automobile became available to most common people. A metro started operating in 1977 between the new suburb of Bijlmer and the centre of Amsterdam. Further plans were to build a new highway above the metro to connect the Central Station and city centre with other parts of the city.</p>\\n<p>The incorporated large-scale demolitions began in Amsterdam's formerly Jewish neighbourhood. Smaller streets, such as the <i>Jodenbreestraat</i>, were widened and saw almost all of their houses demolished. During the destruction's peak, the <i>Nieuwmarktrellen</i> (Nieuwmarkt riots) broke out, where people expressed their fury about the demolition caused by the restructuring of the city.</p>\\n<p>As a result, the demolition was stopped, and the highway was never built, with only the metro being finished. Only a few streets remained widened. The new city hall was built on the almost completely demolished <i>Waterlooplein</i>. Meanwhile, large private organisations, such as <i>Stadsherstel Amsterdam</i>, were founded with the aim of restoring the entire city centre. Although the success of this struggle is visible today, efforts for further restoration are still ongoing. The entire city centre has reattained its former splendor and, as a whole, is now a protected area. Many of its buildings have become monuments, and in July 2010 the <i>Grachtengordel</i> (Herengracht, Keizersgracht, and Prinsengracht) was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Twenty-first century</h3>\\n<p>At the beginning of the new millennium, social problems such as safety, ethnic discrimination and segregation between religious and social groups began to develop. Forty-five percent of the population of Amsterdam has non-Dutch parents. Large social groups come from Suriname, the Dutch Antilles, Morocco and Turkey. Amsterdam is characterized by its (perceived) social tolerance and diversity. The former mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, and his alderman for integration Ahmed Aboutaleb (Now mayor of Rotterdam) formulated a policy of \\\"keeping things together\\\" which involves social dialogue, tolerance and harsh measures against those who break the law.</p>\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam is located in the western Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. The river Amstel terminates in the city centre and connects to a large number of canals that eventually terminate in the IJ. Amsterdam is situated 2 metres below sea level. The surrounding land is flat as it is formed of large polders. A man made forest, Amsterdamse Bos, is situated southwest. Amsterdam is connected to the North Sea through the long North Sea Canal.</p>\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam is intensely urbanized, as is the Amsterdam metropolitan area surrounding the city. Comprising 219.4 kilometres (136.3 miles) of land, the city proper has 4,457 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup> and 2,275 houses per km<sup>2</sup>. Parks and nature reserves make up 12% of Amsterdam's land area.</p>\\n<h3>Venice of the North</h3>\\n<p>Amsterdam is home to more than one hundred kilometers of canals. The three main canals are Prinsengracht, Herengracht and Keizersgracht, all 3 of which are navigable by boat. In the Middle Ages, Amsterdam was surrounded by a moat, called the Singel, which now forms the innermost ring in the city, and makes the city center a horseshoe shape. The city is also served by a seaport. It is often nicknamed the \\\"Venice of the North,\\\" due to its division into approximately 90 islands, which are linked by more than 1,200 bridges.</p>\\n<h3>Climate</h3>\\n<p>Amsterdam has an oceanic climate (K\\u00f6ppen climate classification <i>Cfb</i>), strongly influenced by its proximity to the North Sea to the west, with prevailing westerly winds. Both winters and summers are considered mild, although occasionally quite cool. Amsterdam, as well as most of the North Holland province, lies in USDA Hardiness zone 8b. Frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner European continent. Even then, because Amsterdam is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, as well as having a significant heat-island effect, nights rarely fall below \\u22125\\u00a0\\u00b0C (23\\u00a0\\u00b0F), while it could easily be \\u221212\\u00a0\\u00b0C (10\\u00a0\\u00b0F) in Hilversum, 25 kilometres (16 miles) southeast. Summers are moderately warm but rarely hot. The average daily high in August is 22.1\\u00a0\\u00b0C (71.8\\u00a0\\u00b0F), and 30\\u00a0\\u00b0C (86\\u00a0\\u00b0F) or higher is only measured on average on 2.5 days, placing Amsterdam in AHS Heat Zone 2. The record extremes range from \\u221224\\u00a0\\u00b0C (\\u221211\\u00a0\\u00b0F) to 36.8\\u00a0\\u00b0C (98.2\\u00a0\\u00b0F). Days with more than 1 millimetre (0.04\\u00a0in) of precipitation are common, on average 133 days per year. Amsterdam's average annual precipitation is 838 millimetres (33\\u00a0in), more than what is measured at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. A large part of this precipitation falls as light rain or brief showers. Cloudy and damp days are common during the cooler months of October through March.</p>\\n<h2>Demographics</h2>\\n<p>Amsterdam has a population of 813,562 inhabitants within city limits. As of 2012, the ethnic makeup of Amsterdam was 49.5% of Dutch ancestry and 50.5% of foreign origin. In the 16th and 17th century non-Dutch immigrants to Amsterdam were mostly Huguenots, Flemings, Sephardi Jews and Westphalians. Huguenots came after the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685, while the Flemish Protestants came during the Eighty Years' War. The Westphalians came to Amsterdam mostly for economic reasons \\u2013 their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries. Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was Jewish. Just twenty percent of them survived the Shoah.</p>\\n<p>The first mass immigration in the 20th century were by people from Indonesia, who came to Amsterdam after the independence of the Dutch East Indies in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s guest workers from Turkey, Morocco, Italy and Spain emigrated to Amsterdam. After the independence of Suriname in 1975, a large wave of Surinamese settled in Amsterdam, mostly in the Bijlmer area. Other immigrants, including refugees asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, came from Europe, America, Asia, and Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, many 'old' Amsterdammers moved to 'new' cities like Almere and Purmerend, prompted by the third planological bill of the Dutch government. This bill promoted suburbanisation and arranged for new developments in so called \\\"groeikernen\\\", literally <i>cores of growth</i>. Young professionals and artists moved into neighbourhoods de Pijp and the Jordaan abandoned by these Amsterdammers. The non-Western immigrants settled mostly in the social housing projects in Amsterdam-West and the Bijlmer. Today, people of non-Western origin make up approximately one-third of the population of Amsterdam, and more than 50% of the city' s children. Segregation along ethnic lines is clearly visible, with people of non-Western origin, considered a separate group by Statistics Netherlands, concentrating in specific neighborhoods especially in Nieuw-West, Zeeburg, Bijlmer and in certain areas of Amsterdam-Noord.</p>\\n<p>The largest religious group are Christians (17% in 2000), who are divided between Roman Catholics and Protestants. The next largest religion is Islam (14% in 2000), most of whose followers are Sunni.</p>\\n<h3>Religious history</h3>\\n<p>In 1578 the previously Roman Catholic city of Amsterdam joined the revolt against Spanish rule, late in comparison to other major northern Dutch cities. In line with Protestant procedure of that time, all churches were converted to Protestant worship. Calvinism became the dominant religion, and although Catholicism was not forbidden and priests allowed to serve, the Catholic hierarchy was prohibited. This led to the establishment of <i>schuilkerken</i>, covert churches, behind seemingly ordinary canal side house fronts. One example is the current debate centre de Rode Hoed. A large influx of foreigners of many religions came to 17th-century Amsterdam, in particular Sefardic Jews from Spain and Portugal, Huguenots from France, and Protestants from the Southern Netherlands. This led to the establishment of many non-Dutch-speaking religious churches. In 1603, the first notification was made of Jewish religious service. In 1639, the first synagogue was consecrated. The Jews came to call the town Jerusalem of the West, a reference to their sense of belonging there.</p>\\n\\n<p>As they became established in the city, other Christian denominations used converted Catholic chapels to conduct their own services. The oldest English-language church congregation in the world outside the United Kingdom is found at the Begijnhof. Regular services there are still offered in English under the auspices of the Church of Scotland. The Huguenots accounted for nearly 20% of Amsterdam's inhabitants in 1700. Being Calvinists, they soon integrated into the Dutch Reformed Church, though often retaining their own congregations. Some, commonly referred by the moniker 'Walloon', are recognizable today as they offer occasional services in French.</p>\\n<p>In the second half of the 17th century, Amsterdam experienced an influx of Ashkenazim, Jews from Central and Eastern Europe, which continued into the 19th century. Jews often fled the pogroms in those areas. The first Ashkenazi who arrived in Amsterdam were refugees from the Chmielnicki Uprising in Poland and the Thirty Years' War. They not only founded their own synagogues, but had a strong influence on the 'Amsterdam dialect' adding a large Yiddish local vocabulary.</p>\\n<p>Despite an absence of an official Jewish ghetto, most Jews preferred to live in the eastern part of the old medieval heart of the city. The main street of this Jewish neighborhood was the <i>Jodenbreestraat</i>. The neighborhood comprised the <i>Waterlooplein</i> and the Nieuwmarkt. Buildings in this neighborhood fell into disrepair after the Second World War, and a large section of the neighbourhood was demolished during the construction of the subway. This led to riots, and as a result the original plans for large-scale reconstruction were abandoned and the neighborhood was rebuilt with smaller-scale residence buildings on the basis of its original layout.</p>\\n\\n<p>Catholic churches in Amsterdam have been constructed since the restoration of the episcopal hierarchy in 1853. One of the principal architects behind the city's Catholic churches, Cuypers, was also responsible for the Amsterdam Central Station and the Rijksmuseum, which led to a refusal of Protestant King William III to open 'that monastery'. In 1924, the Roman Catholic Church of the Netherlands hosted the International Eucharistic Congress in Amsterdam, and numerous Catholic prelates visited the city, where festivities were held in churches and stadiums. Catholic processions on the public streets, however, were still forbidden under law at the time. Only in the 20th century was Amsterdam's relation to Catholicism normalized, but despite its far larger population size, the Catholic clergy chose to place its episcopal see of the city in the nearby provincial town of Haarlem.</p>\\n<p>In recent times, religious demographics in Amsterdam have been changed by large-scale immigration from former colonies. Immigrants from Suriname have introduced Evangelical Protestantism and Lutheranism, from the Hernhutter variety; Hinduism has been introduced mainly from Suriname; and several distinct branches of Islam have been brought from various parts of the world. Islam is now the largest non-Christian religion in Amsterdam. The large community of Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants have established African churches, often in parking garages in the Bijlmer area, where many have settled. In addition, a broad array of other religious movements have established congregations, including Buddhism, Confucianism and Hinduism. Jewish make up about 2% of the city total population.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Tolerance and ethnic tension</h3>\\n<p>Although the saying \\\"Leef en laat leven\\\" or \\\"Live and let live\\\" summarizes the Dutch and especially the Amsterdam open and tolerant society, the increased influx of many races, religions, and cultures after the Second World War, has on a number of occasions strained social relations. With 176 different nationalities, Amsterdam is home to one of the widest varieties of nationalities of any city in the world. The share of the population of immigrant ancestry in the city proper now is about 50%. Though 88% of the population has the Dutch nationality</p>\\n<p>The city has been at times marked by ethnic tension. In 2004 film director Theo van Gogh was murdered by an Islamic extremist in Amsterdam. Among others, in line with attitude changes in Dutch politics towards certain (especially Islamic) minorities Turkish-language and Arabic-language TV channels have been dropped from the basic cable TV package. In recent years, politicians are actively discouraged against campaigning in minority languages. In the previous local elections politicians were criticized by current Amsterdam mayor Mr van der Laan (then minister of Integration) for distributing election leaflets in minority languages and in some cases leaflets were collected. Due to this anti-Multicultural stand, van der Laan has been accused of hypocrisy by its own party's PvdA main candidate. Also during the same period, possibly due to his belief in integration via (possibly not always voluntary) assimilation, Amsterdam has been one of the municipalities in the Netherlands which provided immigrants with extensive and free Dutch-language courses, which have benefited many immigrants..</p>\\n<h2>Cityscape and architecture</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam fans out south from the Amsterdam Centraal railway station. The oldest area of the town is known as <i>de Wallen</i> (the quays). It lies to the east of Damrak and contains the city's famous red light district. To the south of de Wallen is the old Jewish quarter of Waterlooplein. The medieval and colonial age canals of Amsterdam, known as <i>Grachten</i>, embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables. Beyond the Grachtengordel are the former working class areas of Jordaan and de Pijp. The Museumplein with the city's major museums, the Vondelpark, a 19th-century park named after the Dutch writer Joost van den Vondel, and the Plantage neighbourhood, with the zoo, are also located outside the Grachtengordel.</p>\\n<p>Several parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are polders. This can be recognised by the suffix <i>-meer</i> which means <i>lake</i>, as in Aalsmeer, Bijlmermeer, Haarlemmermeer, and Watergraafsmeer.</p>\\n<h3>Canals</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>The Amsterdam canal system is the result of conscious city planning. In the early 17th century, when immigration was at a peak, a comprehensive plan was developed that was based on four concentric half-circles of canals with their ends emerging at the IJ bay. Known as the <i>Grachtengordel</i>, three of the canals were mostly for residential development: the <i>Herengracht</i> (where \\\"Heren\\\" refers to <i>Heren Regeerders van de stad Amsterdam</i> (ruling lords of Amsterdam), and <i>gracht</i> means canal, so the name can be roughly translated as \\\"Canal of the lords\\\"), <i>Keizersgracht</i> (Emperor's Canal), and <i>Prinsengracht</i> (Prince's Canal). The fourth and outermost canal is the <i>Singelgracht</i>, which is often not mentioned on maps, because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring. The Singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and most inner canal <i>Singel</i>. The canals served for defence, water management and transport. The defences took the form of a moat and earthen dikes, with gates at transit points, but otherwise no masonry superstructures. The original plans have been lost, so historians, such as Ed Taverne, need to speculate on the original intentions: it is thought that the considerations of the layout were purely practical and defensive rather than ornamental.</p>\\n\\n<p>Construction started in 1613 and proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic windshield wiper as the historian Geert Mak calls it \\u2013 and <i>not</i> from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. The canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656. Subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ bay, has never been implemented. In the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens' homes, theatres, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning.</p>\\n\\n<p>Over the years, several canals have been filled in, becoming streets or squares, such as the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal and the Spui.</p>\\n<h3>Expansion</h3>\\n\\n<p>After the development of Amsterdam's canals in the 17th century, the city did not grow beyond its borders for two centuries. During the 19th century, Samuel Sarphati devised a plan based on the grandeur of Paris and London at that time. The plan envisaged the construction of new houses, public buildings and streets just outside the <i>grachtengordel</i>. The main aim of the plan, however, was to improve public health. Although the plan did not expand the city, it did produce some of the largest public buildings to date, like the <i>Paleis voor Volksvlijt</i>.</p>\\n<p>Following Sarphati, <i>Van Niftrik</i> and <i>Kalff</i> designed an entire ring of 19th century neighbourhoods surrounding the city\\u2019s centre, with the city preserving the ownership of all land outside the 17th century limit, thus firmly controlling development. Most of these neighbourhoods became home to the working class.</p>\\n<p>In response to overcrowding, two plans were designed at the beginning of the 20th century which were very different from anything Amsterdam had ever seen before: <i>Plan Zuid</i>, designed by the architect Berlage, and <i>West</i>. These plans involved the development of new neighbourhoods consisting of <i>housing blocks</i> for all social classes.</p>\\n<p>After the Second World War, large new neighbourhoods were built in the western, southeastern, and northern parts of the city. These new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the city's shortage of living space and give people affordable houses with modern conveniences. The neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks situated among green spaces, connected to wide roads, making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by motor car. The western suburbs which were built in that period are collectively called the <i>Westelijke Tuinsteden</i>. The area to the southeast of the city built during the same period is known as the <i>Bijlmer</i>.</p>\\n<h3>Architecture</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam has a rich architectural history. The oldest building in Amsterdam is the Oude Kerk (Old Church), at the heart of the Wallen, consecrated in 1306. The oldest wooden building is <i>het Houten Huys</i> at the Begijnhof. It was constructed around 1425 and is one of only two existing wooden buildings. It is also one of the few examples of Gothic architecture in Amsterdam. In the 16th century, wooden buildings were razed and replaced with brick ones. During this period, many buildings were constructed in the architectural style of the Renaissance. Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their stepped gable fa\\u00e7ades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style. Amsterdam quickly developed its own Renaissance architecture. These buildings were built according to the principles of the architect Hendrick de Keyser. One of the most striking buildings designed by Hendrick de Keyer is the Westerkerk. In the 17th century baroque architecture became very popular, as it was elsewhere in Europe. This roughly coincided with Amsterdam\\u2019s Golden Age. The leading architects of this style in Amsterdam were Jacob van Campen, Philips Vingboons and Daniel Stalpaert.</p>\\n\\n<p>Philip Vingboons designed splendid merchants' houses throughout the city. A famous building in baroque style in Amsterdam is the Royal Palace on Dam Square. Throughout the 18th century, Amsterdam was heavily influenced by French culture. This is reflected in the architecture of that period. Around 1815, architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo-styles. Most Gothic style buildings date from that era and are therefore said to be built in a neo-gothic style. At the end of the 19th century, the Jugendstil or Art Nouveau style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style. Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. The houses in the vicinity of the Museum Square in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid are an example of Jugendstil. The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the modern era was Art Deco. Amsterdam had its own version of the style, which was called the Amsterdamse School. Whole districts were built this style, such as the <i>Rivierenbuurt</i>. A notable feature of the fa\\u00e7ades of buildings designed in Amsterdamse School is that they are highly decorated and ornate, with oddly shaped windows and doors.</p>\\n<p>The old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century. Jugendstil and Georgian are mostly found outside the city\\u2019s centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early 20th century, although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre. Most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses, such as the famous merchants' houses lining the canals.</p>\\n<h3>Parks and recreational areas</h3>\\n<p>Amsterdam has many parks, open spaces, and squares throughout the city. Vondelpark, the largest park in the city, is located in the Oud-Zuid borough and is named after the 17th century Amsterdam author, Joost van den Vondel. Yearly, the park has around 10 million visitors. In the park is an open air theatre, a playground and several horeca facilities. In the Zuid borough, is Beatrixpark, named after Queen Beatrix. Between Amsterdam and Amstelveen is the Amsterdamse Bos (Amsterdam Forest), the largest recreational area in Amsterdam. Annually, almost 4.5 million people visit the park, which has a size of 1,000 hectares and is approximately three times the size of Central Park. Amstelpark in the Zuid borough houses the Rieker windmill, which dates to 1636. Other parks include Sarphatipark in the De Pijp neighborhood, Oosterpark in the Oost borough, and Westerpark in the Westerpark neighborhood. The city has four beaches, the Nemo Beach, Citybeach \\\"Het stenen hoofd\\\" (Silodam), Blijburg, and one in Amsterdam-Noord.</p>\\n<p>The city has many open squares (plein in Dutch). The namesake of the city as the site of the original dam, Dam Square, is the main town square and has the Royal Palace and National Monument. Museumplein hosts various museums, including the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, and Stedelijk Museum. Other squares include Rembrandtplein, Muntplein, Nieuwmarkt, Leidseplein, Spui, and Waterlooplein.</p>\\n<h2>Economy</h2>\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam is the financial and business capital of the Netherlands. Amsterdam is currently one of the best European cities in which to locate an international business. It is ranked fifth in this category and is only surpassed by London, Paris, Frankfurt and Barcelona. Many large corporations and banks have their headquarters in Amsterdam, including Akzo Nobel, Heineken International, ING Group, TomTom, Delta Lloyd Group and Philips. KPMG International's global headquarters is located in nearby Amstelveen, where many non-Dutch companies have settled as well, because surrounding communities allow full land ownership, contrary to Amsterdam's land-lease system.</p>\\n<p>Though many small offices are still located on the old canals, companies are increasingly relocating outside the city centre. The Zuidas (English: South Axis) has become the new financial and legal hub. The five largest law firms of the Netherlands, a number of Dutch subsidiaries of large consulting firms like Boston Consulting Group and Accenture, and the World Trade Center Amsterdam are also located in Zuidas.</p>\\n<p>There are three other smaller financial districts in Amsterdam. The first is the area surrounding Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station, where several newspapers like De Telegraaf have their offices. Also, Deloitte, the municipal public transport company (<i>Gemeentelijk Vervoersbedrijf</i>) and the Dutch tax offices (<i>Belastingdienst</i>) are located there. The second Financial District is the area surrounding Amsterdam Arena. The third is the area surrounding Amsterdam Amstel railway station. The tallest building in Amsterdam, the Rembrandt Tower, is situated there, as is the headquarters of Philips.</p>\\n<p>The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (AEX), now part of Euronext, is the world's oldest stock exchange and is one of Europe's largest bourses. It is situated near Dam Square in the city's centre.</p>\\n<p>Together with Eindhoven (Brainport) and Rotterdam (Seaport), Amsterdam (Airport) forms the foundation of the Dutch economy.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Tourism</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, receiving more than 4.63\\u00a0million international visitors annually, this is excluding the 16 million day trippers visiting the city every year. The number of visitors has been growing steadily over the past decade. This can be attributed to an increasing number of European visitors. Two thirds of the hotels are located in the city's centre. Hotels with 4 or 5 stars contribute 42% of the total beds available and 41% of the overnight stays in Amsterdam. The room occupation rate was 78% in 2006, up from 70% in 2005. The majority of tourists (74%) originate from Europe. The largest group of non-European visitors come from the United States, accounting for 14% of the total. Certain years have a theme in Amsterdam to attract extra tourists. For example, the year 2006 was designated \\\"Rembrandt 400\\\", to celebrate the 400th birthday of Rembrandt van Rijn. Some hotels offer special arrangements or activities during these years. The average number of guests per year staying at the four campsites around the city range from 12,000 to 65,000.</p>\\n<h4>Red light district</h4>\\n\\n\\n<p><b>De Wallen</b>, also known as <b>Walletjes</b> or <b>Rosse Buurt</b>, is a designated area for legalised prostitution and is Amsterdam's largest and most well known red-light district. This neighborhood has become a famous attraction for tourists. It consists of a network of roads and alleys containing several hundred small, one-room apartments rented by sex workers who offer their services from behind a window or glass door, typically illuminated with red lights.</p>\\n<h3>Retail</h3>\\n<p>Shops in Amsterdam range from large department stores such as De Bijenkorf founded in 1870 and Maison de Bonneterie a Parisian style store founded in 1889, to small specialty shops. Amsterdam's high-end shops are found in the streets <i>Pieter Cornelisz Hooftstraat</i> and <i>Cornelis Schuytstraat</i>, which are located in the vicinity of the Vondelpark. One of Amsterdam's busiest high streets is the narrow, medieval <i>Kalverstraat</i> in the heart of the city. Other shopping areas include the <i>Negen Straatjes</i> and Haarlemmerdijk and Haarlemmerstraat. <i>Negen Straatjes</i> are nine narrow streets within the <i>Grachtengordel</i>, the concentric canal system of Amsterdam. The Negen Straatjes differ from other shopping districts with the presence of a large diversity of privately owned shops. The Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk were voted best shopping street in the Netherlands in 2011. These streets have as the <i>Negen Straatjes</i> a large diversity of privately owned shops. But as the <i>Negen Straatjes</i> are dominated by fashion stores the Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk offer a very wide variety of all kinds of stores, just to name some specialties: candy and other food related stores, lingerie, sneakers, wedding clothing, interior shops, books, Italian deli's, racing and mountain bikes, skatewear, etc.</p>\\n<p>The city also features a large number of open-air markets such as the <i>Albert Cuypmarkt</i>, <i>Westerstraat-markt</i>, <i>Ten Katemarkt</i>, and <i>Dappermarkt</i>. Some of these markets are held on a daily basis, like the Albert Cuypmarkt and the Dappermarkt. Others, like the Westerstraatmarkt, are held on a weekly basis.</p>\\n<h3>Fashion</h3>\\n<p>Fashion brands like G-star, Gsus, BlueBlood, Iris van Herpen, 10 feet and Warmenhoven &amp; Venderbos, and fashion designers like Mart Visser, Viktor &amp; Rolf, Sheila de Vries, Marlies Dekkers and Frans Molenaar are based in Amsterdam. Modelling agencies Elite Models, Touche models and Tony Jones have opened branches in Amsterdam. Fashion models like Yfke Sturm, Doutzen Kroes and Kim Noorda started their careers in Amsterdam. Amsterdam has its garment centre in the World Fashion Center. Buildings which formerly housed brothels in the red light district have been converted to ateliers for young fashion designers, AKA eagle fuel. Fashion photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin were born in Amsterdam.</p>\\n<h2>Culture</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>During the later part of the 16th century Amsterdam's Rederijkerskamer (Chamber of Rhetoric) organized contests between different Chambers in the reading of poetry and drama. In 1638, Amsterdam opened its first theatre. Ballet performances were given in this theatre as early as 1642. In the 18th century, French theatre became popular. While Amsterdam was under the influence of German music in the 19th century there were few national opera productions; the Hollandse Opera of Amsterdam was built in 1888 for the specific purpose of promoting Dutch opera. In the 19th century, popular culture was centred on the Nes area in Amsterdam (mainly vaudeville and music-hall). The metronome, one of the most important advances in European classical music, was invented here in 1812 by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel. At the end of this century, the Rijksmuseum and Stedelijk Museum were built. In 1888, the Concertgebouworkest was established. With the 20th century came cinema, radio and television. Though most studios are located in Hilversum and Aalsmeer, Amsterdam's influence on programming is very strong. Many people who work in the television industry live in Amsterdam. Also, the headquarters of the Dutch SBS Broadcasting Group is located in Amsterdam.</p>\\n<h3>Museums</h3>\\n<p>The most important museums of Amsterdam are located on the Museumplein (<i>Museum Square</i>), located at the southwestern side of the Rijksmuseum. It was created in the last quarter of the 19th century on the grounds of the former World's fair. The northeastern part of the square is bordered by the very large Rijksmuseum. In front of the Rijksmuseum on the square itself is a long, rectangular pond. This is transformed into an ice rink in winter. The northwestern part of the square is bordered by the Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum, House of Bols Cocktail &amp; Genever Experience and Coster Diamonds. The southwestern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is situated across this street from the square. To the southeast of the square are situated a number of large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A parking garage can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. <i>Het Museumplein</i> is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realized in 1999, when the square was remodeled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again, because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Rijksmuseum possesses the largest and most important collection of classical Dutch art. It opened in 1885. Its collection consists of nearly one million objects. The artist most associated with Amsterdam is Rembrandt, whose work, and the work of his pupils, is displayed in the Rijksmuseum. Rembrandt's masterpiece De Nachtwacht (<i>The Night Watch</i>) is one of top pieces of art of the museum. It also houses paintings from artists like Van der Helst, Vermeer, Frans Hals, Ferdinand Bol, Albert Cuyp, Jacob van Ruisdael and Paulus Potter. Aside from paintings, the collection consists of a large variety of decorative art. This ranges from Delftware to giant dollhouses from the 17th century. The architect of the gothic revival building was P.J.H. Cuypers. The museum underwent a 10 year, 375 million euro renovation starting in 2003. The full collection was reopened to the public on April 13, 2013 and the Rijksmuseum has established itself as the most visited museum in Amsterdam with 2.2 million visitors in 2013.</p>\\n<p>Van Gogh lived in Amsterdam for a short while and there is a museum dedicated to his work. The museum is housed in one of the few modern buildings in this area of Amsterdam. The building was designed by Gerrit Rietveld. This building is where the permanent collection is displayed. A new building was added to the museum in 1999. This building, known as the performance wing, was designed by Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa. Its purpose is to house temporary exhibitions of the museum. Some of Van Gogh's most famous paintings, like the Aardappeleters (<i>The Potato Eaters</i>) and Zonnebloemen (<i>Sunflowers</i>), are present in the collection. The Van Gogh museum is the second most visited museum in Amsterdam, with 1.4 million annual visitors.</p>\\n<p>Next to the Van Gogh museum stands the Stedelijk Museum. This is Amsterdam's most important museum of modern art . The museum is as old as the square it borders and was opened in 1895. The permanent collection consists of works of art from artists like Piet Mondriaan, Karel Appel, and Kazimir Malevich. After renovations lasting several years the museum opened in September 2012 with a new composite extension that has been called \\\"The Bathtub\\\" due to its resemblance to one.</p>\\n<p>Amsterdam contains many other museums throughout the city. They range from small museums such as the Verzetsmuseum (<i>Resistance Museum</i>), the Anne Frank Huis (<i>Anne Frank House</i>), and the Rembrandthuis (<i>Rembrandt House</i>), to the very large, like the Tropenmuseum (<i>Museum of the Tropics</i>), Amsterdam Museum (formerly known as \\\"Amsterdams Historisch Museum\\\", <i>Amsterdam Historical Museum</i>), Hermitage Amsterdam (a dependency of the Hermitage Museum of Saint Petersburg) and the Joods Historisch Museum (<i>Jewish Historical Museum</i>). The modern-styled NEMO (museum) is dedicated to child-friendly science exhibitions.</p>\\n<h3>Music</h3>\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam's musical culture includes a large collection of songs which treat the city nostalgically and lovingly. The 1949 song \\\"Aan de Amsterdamse grachten\\\" (\\\"On the canals of Amsterdam\\\") was performed and recorded by many artists, including John Kraaijkamp sr.; the best-known version is probably that by Wim Sonneveld (1962). In the 1950s Johnny Jordaan rose to fame with \\\"Geef mij maar Amsterdam\\\" (\\\"I prefer Amsterdam\\\"), which praises the city above all others (explicitly Paris); Jordaan sang especially about his own neighborhood, the Jordaan (\\\"Bij ons in de Jordaan\\\"). Colleagues and contemporaries of Johnny include Tante Leen, Zwarte Riek, and Manke Nelis. Other notable Amsterdam songs are \\\"Amsterdam\\\" by Jacques Brel (1964) and \\\"Deze Stad\\\" by De Dijk (1989). A 2011 poll by Amsterdam paper <i>Het Parool</i> found, somewhat surprisingly, that Trio Bier's \\\"Oude Wolf\\\" was voted \\\"Amsterdams lijflied\\\". Notable Amsterdam bands from the modern era include the Osdorp Posse and The Ex.</p>\\n<p>The Heineken Music Hall is a concert hall located near the Amsterdam ArenA. Its main purpose is to serve as a podium for pop concerts for big audiences. Many famous international artists have performed there. Two other notable venues, Paradiso and the Melkweg are located near the Leidseplein. Both focus on broad programming, ranging from indie rock to hip hop, R&amp;B, and other popular genres. Other more subculturally focused music venues are OCCII, OT301, De Nieuwe Anita, Winston Kingdom and Zaal 100. Jazz has a strong following in Amsterdam, with the Bimhuis being the premier venue. In 2012, Ziggo Dome was opened, also near Amsterdam ArenA, a state of the art indoor music arena.</p>\\n<p>The Heineken Music Hall is also host to many electronic dance music festivals, alongside many other venues. Armin van Buuren and Tiesto, some of the world's leading Trance DJ's hail from the Netherlands and perform frequently in Amsterdam. Each year in October, the city hosts the Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE) which is one of the leading electronic music conferences and one of the biggest club festivals for electronic music in the world. Another popular dance festival is 5daysoff, which takes place in the venues Paradiso and Melkweg. In summer time there are several big outdoor dance parties in or nearby Amsterdam, such as Awakenings, Dance Valley, Mystery Land, Loveland, A Day at the Park, Welcome to the Future, and Valtifest.</p>\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam has a world-class symphony orchestra, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Their home is the Concertgebouw, which is across the Van Baerlestraat from the Museum Square. It is considered by critics to be a concert hall with some of the best acoustics in the world. The building contains three halls, Grote Zaal, Kleine Zaal, and Spiegelzaal. Some nine hundred concerts and other events per year take place in the Concertgebouw, for a public of over 700,000, making it one of the most-visited concert halls in the world. The opera house of Amsterdam is situated adjacent to the city hall. Therefore, the two buildings combined are often called the Stopera, (a word originally coined by protesters against it very construction: <i>Stop the Opera[-house]</i>). This huge modern complex, opened in 1986, lies in the former Jewish neighbourhood at <i>Waterlooplein</i> next to the river Amstel. The <i>Stopera</i> is the homebase of Dutch National Opera, Dutch National Ballet and the Holland Symfonia. Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ is a concert hall, which is situated in the IJ near the central station. Its concerts perform mostly modern classical music. Located adjacent to it, is the <i>Bimhuis</i>, a concert hall for improvised and Jazz music.</p>\\n<h3>Performing arts</h3>\\n<p>Amsterdam has three main theatre buildings.</p>\\n<p>The Stadsschouwburg Amsterdam at the Leidseplein is the home base of Toneelgroep Amsterdam. The current building dates from 1894. Most plays are performed in the Grote Zaal (Great Hall). The normal program of events encompasses all sorts of theatrical forms. The Stadsschouwburg is currently being renovated and expanded. The third theater space, to be operated jointly with next door Melkweg, will open in late 2009 or early 2010.</p>\\n<p>Dutch National Opera &amp; Ballet (formerly known as <i>Het Muziektheater</i>), dating from 1986, is the principal opera house and home to Dutch National Opera and Dutch National Ballet.</p>\\n<p>Royal Theatre Carr\\u00e9 was built as a permanent circus theatre in 1887 and is currently mainly used for musicals, cabaret performances and pop concerts.</p>\\n<p>The recently re-opened DeLaMar Theater houses the more commercial plays and musicals.</p>\\n<p>The Netherlands has a tradition of cabaret or <i>kleinkunst</i>, which combines music, storytelling, commentary, theatre and comedy. Cabaret dates back to the 1930s and artists like Wim Kan, Wim Sonneveld and Toon Hermans were pioneers of this form of art in the Netherlands. In Amsterdam is the Kleinkunstacademie (English: Cabaret Academy). Contemporary popular artists are Youp van 't Hek, Freek de Jonge, Herman Finkers, Hans Teeuwen, Theo Maassen, Herman van Veen, Najib Amhali, Raoul Heertje, J\\u00f6rgen Raymann, Brigitte Kaandorp and Comedytrain. The English spoken comedy scene was established with the founding of Boom Chicago in 1993. They have their own theatre at Leidseplein.</p>\\n<h3>Nightlife</h3>\\n<p>Amsterdam is famous for its vibrant and diverse nightlife. Amsterdam has many <i>caf\\u00e9s</i> (bars). They range from large and modern to small and cozy. The typical <i>Bruine Kroeg</i> (brown <i>caf\\u00e9</i>) breathe a more old fashioned atmosphere with dimmed lights, candles, and somewhat older clientele. Most <i>caf\\u00e9s</i> have terraces in summertime. A common sight on the Leidseplein during summer is a square full of terraces packed with people drinking beer or wine. Many restaurants can be found in Amsterdam as well. Since Amsterdam is a multicultural city, a lot of different ethnic restaurants can be found. Restaurants range from being rather luxurious and expensive to being ordinary and affordable. Amsterdam also possesses many discoth\\u00e8ques. The two main nightlife areas for tourists are the Leidseplein and the Rembrandtplein. The Paradiso, Melkweg and Sugar Factory are cultural centres, which turn into discoth\\u00e8ques on some nights. Examples of discoth\\u00e8ques near the Rembrandtplein are the Escape and Club Home. Also noteworthy are Panama, Hotel Arena (East), TrouwAmsterdam and Studio 80. Bimhuis located near the Central Station, with its rich programming hosting the best in the field is considered one of the best jazz clubs in the world. The Reguliersdwarsstraat is the main street for the LGBT community and nightlife.</p>\\n<h3>Festivals</h3>\\n\\n<p>In 2008, there were 140 festivals and events in Amsterdam. Famous festivals and events in Amsterdam include: Koninginnedag (In 2013 Koningsdag since the crowning of king Willem-Alexander) (Queen's Day - King's Day); the Holland Festival for the performing arts; the yearly Prinsengrachtconcert (classical concerto on the Prinsen canal) in August; the 'Stille Omgang' (a silent Roman Catholic evening procession held every March); Amsterdam Gay Pride; The Cannabis Cup; and the Uitmarkt. On Koninginnedag\\u2014that was held each year on 30 April\\u2014hundreds of thousands of people travel to Amsterdam to celebrate with the city's residents and Koningsdag is held on the 27th of April. The entire city becomes overcrowded with people buying products from the <i>freemarket,</i> or visiting one of the many music concerts.</p>\\n<p>The yearly Holland Festival attracts international artists and visitors from all over Europe. Amsterdam Gay Pride is a yearly local LGBT parade of boats in Amsterdam's canals, held on the first Saturday in August. The Gay Pride event is a frequent source of both criticism and praise. The annual Uitmarkt is a three-day cultural event at the start of the cultural season in late August. It offers previews of many different artists, such as musicians and poets, who perform on podia.</p>\\n<h3>Sports</h3>\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam is home of the <i>Eredivisie</i> football club Ajax Amsterdam. The stadium Amsterdam ArenA is the home of Ajax. It is located in the south-east of the city next to the new Amsterdam Bijlmer ArenA railway station. Before moving to their current location in 1996, Ajax played their regular matches in De Meer Stadion. In 1928, Amsterdam hosted the Summer Olympics. The Olympic Stadium built for the occasion has been completely restored and is now used for cultural and sporting events, such as the Amsterdam Marathon. In 1920, Amsterdam assisted in hosting some of the sailing events for the Summer Olympics held in neighboring Antwerp, Belgium by hosting events at Buiten Y.</p>\\n<p>The city holds the Dam to Dam Run, a 10-mile race from Amsterdam to Zaandam, as well as the Amsterdam Marathon.</p>\\n<p>The ice hockey team Amstel Tijgers play in the Jaap Eden ice rink. The team competes in the Dutch ice hockey premier league. Speed skating championships have been held on the 400-metre lane of this ice rink.</p>\\n<p>Amsterdam holds two American Football franchises: the Amsterdam Crusaders and the Amsterdam Panthers. The Amsterdam Pirates baseball team competes in the Dutch Major League. There are three field hockey teams: Amsterdam, Pinok\\u00e9 and Hurley, who play their matches around the Wagener Stadium in the nearby city of Amstelveen. The basketball team MyGuide Amsterdam competes in the Dutch premier division and play their games in the Sporthallen Zuid.</p>\\n<p>There is one rugbyclub in Amsterdam, which also hosts sports training classes such as RTC(Rugby Talenten Centrum or Rugby Talent Centre) and the National Rugby stadium.</p>\\n<p>Since 1999 the city of Amsterdam honours the best sportsmen and women at the Amsterdam Sports Awards. Boxer Raymond Joval and field hockey midfielder Carole Thate were the first to receive the awards, in 1999.</p>\\n<h2>Government</h2>\\n\\n<p>The city of Amsterdam is a municipality under the Dutch Municipalities Act. It is governed by a directly elected municipal council, a municipal executive board and a mayor. Since 1981, the municipality of Amsterdam has gradually been divided into semi-autonomous boroughs, called <i>stadsdelen</i> or 'districts'. Over time, a total of 15 boroughs were created. In May 2010, under a major reform, the number of Amsterdam boroughs was reduced to eight: Amsterdam-Centrum covering the city centre including the canal belt, Amsterdam-Noord consisting of the neighborhoods north of the IJ lake, Amsterdam-Oost in the east, Amsterdam-Zuid in the south, Amsterdam-West in the west, Amsterdam Nieuw-West in the far west, Amsterdam Zuidoost in the southeast, and Westpoort covering the Port of Amsterdam area.</p>\\n<h3>City government</h3>\\n\\n<p>As with all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a directly elected municipal council, a municipal executive board and a mayor (<i>burgemeester</i>). The mayor is a member of the municipal executive board, but also has individual responsibilies in maintaining public order. In July 2010, Eberhard van der Laan (Labour Party) was appointed mayor of Amsterdam by the national government for a six-year term after being nominated by the Amsterdam municipal council. After the 2014 municipal council elections, a governing majority of D66, VVD and SP was formed - the first coalition without the Labour Party since World War II. Next to the mayor, the municipal executive board consists of eight <i>wethouders</i> ('alderpersons') appointed by the municipal council: four D66 alderpersons, two VVD alderpersons and two SP alderpersons.</p>\\n\\n<p>Unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into eight boroughs, called <i>stadsdelen</i> or 'districts', a system that was implemented gradually in the 1980s to improve local governance. The boroughs are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. In 2010, the number of Amsterdam boroughs reached fifteen. Fourteen of those had their own district council (<i>deelraad</i>), elected by a popular vote. The fifteenth, Westpoort, covers the harbour of Amsterdam and had very few residents. Therefore, it was governed by the central municipal council. Under the borough system, municipal decisions are made at borough level, except for those affairs pertaining to the whole city such as major infrastructure projects, which are the jurisdiction of the central municipal authorities. In 2010, the borough system was restructured, in which many smaller boroughs merged into larger boroughs. In 2014, under a reform of the Dutch Municipalities Act, the Amsterdam boroughs lost much of their autonomous status, as their district councils were abolished. The municipal council of Amsterdam voted to maintain the borough system by replacing the district councils with smaller, but still directly elected district committees (<i>bestuurscommissies</i>). Under a municipal ordinance, the new district committees were granted responsibilities through delegation of regulatory and executive powers by the central municipal council.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Metropolitan area</h3>\\n\\n<p>\\\"Amsterdam\\\" is usually understood to refer to the municipality of Amsterdam. Colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the town of Durgerdam, may not be considered part of Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p>Statistics Netherlands uses three other definitions of Amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration Amsterdam (<i>Grootstedelijke Agglomeratie Amsterdam</i>, not to be confused with <i>Grootstedelijk Gebied Amsterdam</i>, a synonym of <i>Groot Amsterdam</i>), Greater Amsterdam (<i>Groot Amsterdam</i>, a COROP region) and the urban region Amsterdam (<i>Stadsgewest Amsterdam</i>). The Amsterdam Department for Research and Statistics uses a fourth conurbation, namely the <i>Stadsregio Amsterdam</i> ('City Region of Amsterdam'). The city region is similar to Greater Amsterdam but includes the municipalities of Zaanstad and Wormerland. It excludes Graft-De Rijp.</p>\\n<p>The smallest of these areas is the municipality of Amsterdam with a population of 802,938 in 2013. The metropolitan agglomeration had a population of 1,096,042 in 2013. It includes the municipalities of Zaanstad, Wormerland, Oostzaan, Diemen and Amstelveen only, as well as the municipality of Amsterdam. Greater Amsterdam includes 15 municipalities, and had a population of 1,293,208 in 2013. Though much larger in area, the population of this area is only slightly larger, because the definition excludes the relatively populous municipality of Zaanstad. The largest area by population, the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (Dutch: Metropoolregio Amsterdam), has a population of 2,33\\u00a0million. It includes for instance Zaanstad, Wormerveer, Muiden, Abcoude, Haarlem, Almere and Lelystad but excludes Graft-De Rijp. Amsterdam is part of the conglomerate metropolitan area Randstad, with a total population of 6,659,300 inhabitants.</p>\\n<p>Of these various metropolitan area configurations, only the <i>Stadsregio Amsterdam</i> (City Region of Amsterdam) has a formal governmental status. Its responsibities include regional spatial planning and the metropolitan public transport concessions.</p>\\n<h3>National capital</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>Under the Dutch Constitution, Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands. Since the 1983 constitutional revision, the constitution mentions \\\"Amsterdam\\\" and \\\"capital\\\" in chapter 2, article 32: The king's confirmation by oath and his coronation take place in \\\"the capital Amsterdam\\\" (\\\"<i>de hoofdstad Amsterdam</i>\\\"). Previous versions of the constitution only mentioned \\\"the city of Amsterdam\\\" (\\\"<i>de stad Amsterdam</i>\\\"). For a royal investiture, therefore, the States General of the Netherlands (the Dutch Parliament) meets for a ceremonial joint session in Amsterdam. The ceremony traditionally takes place at the Nieuwe Kerk on Dam Square, immediately after the former monarch has signed the act of abdication at the nearby Royal Palace of Amsterdam. Normally, however, the Parliament sits in The Hague, the city which has historically been the seat of the Dutch government, the Dutch monarchy, and the Dutch supreme court. Foreign embassies are also located in The Hague.</p>\\n<h3>Symbols</h3>\\n\\n<p>The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. First and centre are three St Andrew's crosses, aligned in a vertical band on the city's shield (although Amsterdam's patron saint was Saint Nicholas). These St Andrew's crosses can also be found on the cityshields of neighbours Amstelveen and Ouder-Amstel. This part of the coat of arms is the basis of the flag of Amsterdam, flown by the city government, but also as civil ensign for ships registered in Amsterdam. Second is the Imperial Crown of Austria. In 1489, out of gratitude for services and loans, Maximilian I awarded Amsterdam the right to adorn its coat of arms with the king's crown. Then, in 1508, this was replaced with Maximilian's imperial crown when he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor. In the early years of the 17th century, Maximilian's crown in Amsterdam's coat of arms was again replaced, this time with the crown of Emperor Rudolph II, a crown that became the Imperial Crown of Austria. The lions date from the late 16th century, when city and province became part of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. Last came the city's official motto: <i>Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig</i> (\\\"Heroic, Determined, Merciful\\\"), bestowed on the city in 1947 by Queen Wilhelmina, in recognition of the city's bravery during the Second World War.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n\\n\\n<h3>Metro, tram, bus</h3>\\n\\n<p>Currently, there are sixteen tram routes and four metro routes, with a fifth route to be added when the North/South metro line is completed (due in 2017). All are operated by municipal public transport operator GVB, which also runs the city bus network.</p>\\n<p>Three, fare-free GVB ferries carry pedestrians and cyclists across the IJ lake to the borough of Amsterdam-Noord, and two fare-charging ferries run east and west along the harbour. There are also privately operated water taxis, a water bus, a boat sharing operation, electric rental boats (Boaty) and canal cruises, that transport people along Amsterdam's waterways.</p>\\n<p>Regional buses, and some suburban buses, are operated by Connexxion and EBS. International coach services are provided by Eurolines from Amsterdam Amstel railway station, IDBUS from Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station, and Megabus from <i>Zuiderzeeweg</i> in the east of the city.</p>\\n<h3>Car</h3>\\n<p>Amsterdam was intended in 1932 to be the hub, a kind of Kilometre Zero, of the highway system of the Netherlands, with freeways numbered One to Eight planned to originate from the city. The outbreak of the Second World War and shifting priorities led to the current situation, where only roads A1, A2, and A4 originate from Amsterdam according to the original plan. The A3 road to Rotterdam was cancelled in 1970 in order to conserve the Groene Hart. Road A8, leading north to Zaandam and the A10 Ringroad were opened between 1968 and 1974. Besides the A1, A2, A4 and A8, several freeways, such as the A7 and A6, carry traffic mainly bound for Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p>The A10 ringroad surrounding the city connects Amsterdam with the Dutch national network of freeways. Interchanges on the A10 allow cars to enter the city by transferring to one of the 18 <i>city roads</i>, numbered S101 through to S118. These city roads are regional roads without grade separation, and sometimes without a central reservation. Most are accessible by cyclists. The S100 <i>Centrumring</i> is a smaller ringroad circumnavigating the city's centre.</p>\\n<p>In the city centre, driving a car is discouraged. Parking fees are expensive, and many streets are closed to cars or are one-way. The local government sponsors carsharing and carpooling initiatives such as <i>Autodelen</i> and <i>Meerijden.nu</i>.</p>\\n<h3>National rail</h3>\\n<p>Amsterdam is served by ten stations of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Dutch Railways). Six are intercity stops: Sloterdijk, Zuid, Amstel, Bijlmer ArenA, Lelylaan and Amsterdam Centraal. The stations for local services are: RAI, Holendrecht, Muiderpoort and Science Park. Amsterdam Centraal is also an international railway station. From the station there are regular services to destinations such as Austria, Belarus, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Russia and Switzerland. Among these trains are international trains of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Amsterdam-Berlin) and the Thalys (Amsterdam-Brussels-Paris/Lille), CityNightLine, and InterCityExpress (Amsterdam-Cologne-Frankfurt).</p>\\n<h3>Airport</h3>\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (IATA: <b>AMS</b>,\\u00a0ICAO: <b>EHAM</b>) is less than 20 minutes by train from Amsterdam Centraal railway station and is also served by domestic and international intercity trains, such as Thalys and Intercity Brussel. Schiphol is the largest airport in the Netherlands, the fourth largest in Europe, and the fourteenth largest in the world in terms of passengers. It handles about 50\\u00a0million passengers per year and is the home base of four airlines, KLM, transavia.com, Martinair and Arkefly. As of 2013, Schiphol was the sixth busiest airport in the world measured by international passenger numbers.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Cycling</h3>\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam is one of the most bicycle-friendly large cities in the world and is a centre of bicycle culture with good facilities for cyclists such as bike paths and bike racks, and several guarded bike storage garages (<i>fietsenstalling</i>) which can be used for a nominal fee. In 2013, there were about 1,200,000 bicycles in Amsterdam outnumbering the amount of citizens in the city. Theft is widespread \\u2013 in 2011, about 83,000 bicycles were stolen in Amsterdam. Bicycles are used by all socio-economic groups because of their convenience, Amsterdam's small size, the 400 kilometres (249 miles) of bike paths, the flat terrain, and the arguable inconvenience of driving an automobile.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam has two universities: the University of Amsterdam (Universiteit van Amsterdam), and the VU University Amsterdam (Vrije Universiteit or \\\"VU\\\"). Other institutions for higher education include an art school \\u2013 Gerrit Rietveld Academie, a university of applied sciences - the Hogeschool van Amsterdam, and the Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten. Amsterdam's International Institute of Social History is one of the world's largest documentary and research institutions concerning social history, and especially the history of the labour movement. Amsterdam's Hortus Botanicus, founded in the early 17th century, is one of the oldest botanical gardens in the world, with many old and rare specimens, among them the coffee plant that served as the parent for the entire coffee culture in Central and South America.</p>\\n<p>Some of Amsterdam's primary schools base their teachings on particular pedagogic theories like the various Montessori schools. The biggest Montessori High School in Amsterdam is the Montessori Lyceum Amsterdam. Many schools, however, are based on religion. This used to be primarily Roman Catholicism and various Protestant denominations, but with the influx of Muslim immigrants there has been a rise in the number of Islamic schools. Jewish schools can be found in the southern suburbs of Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p>Amsterdam is noted for having five independent grammar schools (Dutch: gymnasia), the Vossius Gymnasium, Barlaeus Gymnasium, St. Ignatius Gymnasium, Het 4e Gymnasium and the Cygnus Gymnasium where a classical curriculum including Latin and classical Greek is taught. Though believed until recently by many to be an anachronistic and elitist concept that would soon die out, the gymnasia have recently experienced a revival, leading to the formation of a fourth and fifth grammar school in which the three aforementioned schools participate. Most secondary schools in Amsterdam offer a variety of different levels of education in the same school. The city also has various colleges ranging from art and design to politics and economics which are mostly also available for students coming from other countries.</p>\\n<h2>Notable people</h2>\\n<ul><li>Frits Bolkestein (born 1933), politician</li>\\n<li>Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken (born 1954), businesswoman</li>\\n<li>Paul Crutzen (born 1933), atmospheric chemist</li>\\n<li>Willem Drees sr.

Some locally based newspapers include Het Parool, a national daily paper; De Telegraaf, the largest Dutch daily newspaper; the daily newspapers Trouw, De Volkskrant and NRC Handelsblad; De Groene Amsterdammer, a weekly newspaper; the free newspapers Sp!ts, Metro, and The Holland Times (printed in English).</p>\\n<p>Amsterdam is home to the Netherlands' second-largest commercial TV group SBS Broadcasting Group, consisting of TV-stations SBS 6, Net 5 and Veronica. However, Amsterdam is not being considered 'the media city of the Netherlands'. The town of Hilversum, 30\\u00a0km (19\\u00a0mi) south-east of Amsterdam, has been crowned with this unofficial title. Hilversum is the principal center for radio and television broadcasting in the Netherlands. Radio Netherlands, heard worldwide via shortwave radio since the 1920s, is also based there. Hilversum is home to an extensive complex of audio and television studios belonging to the national broadcast production company NOS, as well as to the studios and offices of all the Dutch public broadcasting organizations and many commercial TV production companies.</p>\\n<p>Amsterdam is also featured in John Green's book 'The Fault in Our Stars,' which has also been made into a film, and part of the film takes place in Amsterdam.</p>\\n<h2>Housing</h2>\\n<p>The housing market is heavily regulated. In Amsterdam, 55% of existing housing and 30% of new housing is owned by Housing Associations, which are Government sponsored entities.</p>\\n<p>Squat properties are common throughout Amsterdam, due to property law strongly favouring tenants. A number of these squats have become well known, such as OT301, Paradiso, Vrankrijk (closed down by city government), and the Binnenpret, and several are now businesses, such as health clubs and licensed restaurants.</p>\\n<h2>International relations</h2>\\n\\n<p>Amsterdam is twinned with the following cities:</p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>Amsterdammertje</li>\\n<li>Amstel</li>\\n<li>Dam Square</li>\\n<li>Government of Amsterdam</li>\\n<li>History of Amsterdam</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<dl><dt>Attribution</dt>\\n</dl><ul><li>\\u00a0This article\\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\\u00a0Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

In an editorial, the newspaper most closely associated with the government PvdA party, <i>de Volkskrant</i>, immediately condemned the decision to police satire or other 'cultural candy'. Many cartoonists of newspapers made drawings in support of Gregorius Nekschot.

It is one of the largest research universities in Europe with 29,783 students, 4,629 staff, and an endowment of \\u20ac613.5 million. It is the largest university in the Netherlands by enrollment and has the second-largest university endowment in the country. The main campus is located in central Amsterdam, with a few faculties located in adjacent boroughs. The university is organised into seven faculties: Humanities, Social and Behavioural Sciences, Economics and Business, Science, Law, Medicine, and Dentistry.</p>\\n<p>The University of Amsterdam has produced six Nobel Laureates and five prime ministers of the Netherlands. In 2013, it was ranked 58th in the world, 17th in Europe, and 1st in the Netherlands by the QS World University Rankings. The university placed in the top 50 worldwide in seven fields in the 2011 QS World University Rankings in the fields of Linguistics, Sociology, Philosophy, Geography, Science, Economics &amp; Econometrics, and Accountancy &amp; Finance.</p>\\n<p>The University of Amsterdam is a member of the League of European Research Universities (LERU), the Institutional Network of the Universities from the Capitals of Europe (UNICA), European University Association (EUA), and Universitas 21.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n<h3>Athenaeum Illustre (1632-1877)</h3>\\n<p>In January 1632, the <b>Athenaeum Illustre</b> (Latin: Illustrious School) was founded by the municipal authorities in Amsterdam. It was mainly devoted to medical teaching. The first two professors were Gerardus Vossius and Caspar Barlaeus. The <i>Athenaeum Illustre</i> provided education comparable to other higher education institutions, although it could not confer doctoral degrees. After training at the <i>Athenaeum</i>, students could complete their education at a university in another town.</p>\\n<p>At the time, Amsterdam also housed several other institutions of higher education, including the Collegium Chirugicum, which trained surgeons, and other institutions that provided theological courses for the Remonstrant and the Mennonite communities. Amsterdam's large degree of religious freedom allowed for the establishment of these institutions. Students of the Colegium Chirugicum and the theological institutions regularly attended classes at the <i>Athenaeum Illustre</i>.</p>\\n\\n<p>In 1815 it was given the statutory obligation \\u201cto disseminate taste, civilisation and learning\\\" and \\u201cto replace, at least in part, the institutes of higher education and an academic education for those young men whose circumstances unable them to fully spend the time necessary for an academic career at an institute of higher education.\\u201d The <i>Athenaeum</i> began offering classes for students attending non-academic professional training in pharmacy and surgery in 1800. The <i>Athenaeum Illustre</i> largely worked together with Amsterdam's theological institutions such as the <i>Evangelisch-Luthers Seminarium</i> (evangelical-Lutheran) and the <i>Klinische</i> School (medical school), the successor to the <i>Collegium Chirurgicum</i>.</p>\\n<p>The <i>Athenaeum</i> remained a small institution until the 19th century, with no more than 250 students and eight professors. Alumni of the <i>Athenaeum</i> include Cornelis Petrus Tiele.</p>\\n<h3>Municipal university (1877-1961)</h3>\\n<p>In 1877, the <i>Athenuem Illustre</i> became the <b>Municipal University of Amsterdam</b> and received the right to confer doctoral degrees. This gave the university the same privileges as national universities while being funded by the city of Amsterdam. The professors and lecturers were appointed by the city council. This resulted in a staff that was in many ways more colorful than the staffs of national universities. During its time as a municipal university, the university flourished, in particular in the science department, which counted many Nobel prize winners: Tobias Asser, Christiaan Eijkman, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, Johannes Diderik van der Waals, Pieter Zeeman, and Frits Zernike.</p>\\n<p>The University of Amsterdam's municipal status brought about the relatively early addition of the faculties of Economics and Social Sciences. After the World War II the dramatic rise in the cost of university education put a constraint on the university\\u2019s growth.</p>\\n\\n<h3>National university (1961-present)</h3>\\n<p>In 1961 the national government made the university a national university, giving it its current name, the <b>University of Amsterdam</b>. Funding was now given by the national government instead of the city and the appointment of professors was transferred to the Board of Governors. The city of Amsterdam retained a limited influence until 1971, when the appointment was handed over to the Executive Board.</p>\\n<p>During May 1969, the university became the focus of nationwide news when UvA's administrative centre at the <i>Maagdenhuis</i> was occupied by hundreds of students who wanted more democratic influence in educational and administrative matters. The protest lasted for days and was eventually broken up by the police. During the 1970s and 1980s, the university was often the target of nationwide student actions.</p>\\n<p>The university saw considerable expansion since becoming a national university, from 7,500 students in 1960 to over 32,000 in 2010. In 2007, UvA undertook the construction of the Science Park Amsterdam, a 70 hectare campus to house the Faculty of Science along with the new University Sports Center. Much of the park has now been completed. The University of Amsterdam began working in close collaboration with the <i>Hogeschool van Amsterdam</i> to allow students from UvA and HvA to take classes at both schools through an integrated curriculum. In 2008, the University of Amsterdam and VU University jointly founded the Amsterdam University College (AUC), an interuniversity institute that offers a three-year Bachelor (Honors) program in the Liberal Arts and Sciences.</p>\\n<h3>University logo</h3>\\n<p>The current logo of the University of Amsterdam consists of a black square with three white Saint Andrew's Crosses and a white \\\"U.\\\" This an adaptation of the coat of arms of Amsterdam which also uses a black background and three white or silver Saint Andrew's Crosses. The three Saint Andrew's Crosses have been said to represent the three plagues of Amsterdam: fire, floods, and the Black Death. Another rumor is that they represent three fords in the River Amstel. These two explanations have no historical basis, however. It is believed by historians that the coat of arms of Amsterdam is derived from the coat of arms of Jan Persijn, the lord of Amsterdam between 1280 and 1282. The \\\"U\\\" represents the word \\\"university\\\" while the colours and three crosses represent the city of Amsterdam.</p>\\n<h2>Academics</h2>\\n\\n<p>The university is accredited by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, which grants accreditation to institutions who meet a national system of regulations and quality assurance controls. The Ministry has given it WO, or research university status. Dutch students must complete a six-year preparatory program to gain admission to national research universities. Only fifteen percent of students pass this preparatory program.</p>\\n<p>In terms of tuition in 2011-2012, EU students are charged \\u20ac1,713 per year for both Bachelor's and Master's programs and non-EU students are charged between \\u20ac9,000-\\u20ac11,000 per year for Bachelor's programs and \\u20ac10,500-\\u20ac25,000 for Master's and Doctoral programs. Costs for non-EU students varies depending on the faculty of matriculation. In terms of scholarships, the university offers UvA Amsterdam Merit Scholarships, scholarships through the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, Dutch Study Grants, and various European scholarships.</p>\\n<p>Collectively the faculties offer 59 Bachelor's programmes, 133 Master's programmes, and 10 postgraduate programs. The university awarded 2,565 propaedeutic, 3,204 Bachelor's, 3,990 Master's, 438 Doctoral, 242 Post-Doctoral degrees in 2009-2010, and 10,438 total degrees in 2009-2010. The school's academic year lasts from early September until mid-July and is divided into two 20-week semesters. The first of these ends in late January and the second begins in early February. There are no mid-term breaks, only a short holiday around Christmas and New Year as well as Dutch National holidays.</p>\\n<h3>Student Body</h3>\\n<p>In 2010, the university had an enrolment of 32,739 students: 20,185 undergraduate students, 9,361 master's students, 1,235 doctoral students, and 412 post-doctoral students. Of all students, 93.4% are Dutch citizens and 6.6% are international students. UvA has over 2,500 international students and researchers that come from over 100 countries. Full-time students comprised 91% of the student body. In 2010 students were enrolled in 7 faculties and the Amsterdam University College: 24% in Humanities, 13% in Law, 7% in Medicine, 1% in Dentistry, 11% in Science, 13% in Economics &amp; Business, 30% in Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, and 0.5% in the Amsterdam University College.</p>\\n<p>Overall, 20% of students in bachelor's programs complete their degree within three years, 48% in four years, and 69% in five years; 71% of master's students completed their degree in two years. Students on average successfully complete 44 ECTS credits during the academic year. In 2007, 88% of master's and doctoral graduates went on to become paying jobs, with an additional 5% going on to continue their education within 1.5 years of graduating.</p>\\n<h3>Faculties</h3>\\n<p>The university is divided into seven faculties, with each faculty headed by a dean.

The university spends about \\u20ac100 million on research each year via direct funding. It receives an additional \\u20ac23 million via indirect funding and about \\u20ac49 million from commercial partners. Faculty members often receive research prizes and grants, such as those from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). Research is organized into fifteen research priority areas and 28 research institutes within the faculties oversee this research.</p>\\n<p>The University of Amsterdam has an extensive central University Library (UBA), with over four million volumes. In addition, a number of departments have their own libraries. The main university library is located in the city center. It contains over four million books, 70,000 manuscripts, 500,000 letters, and 125,000 maps, as well as special collections of the Department of Rare and Precious Works, the Manuscript and Writing Museum, the <i>Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana</i> on Jewish history and culture, and the Department of Documentation on Social Movements.

Because UvA is not a separate, secluded campus, students and city residents readily mix, allowing Amsterdam to maintain close cultural and academic ties to the school. The majority of UvA's buildings lie in the heart of Amsterdam, with only the faculties of Science, Medicine and Dentistry located outside the City Centre. The university lies within the largest megalopolis in the Netherlands, the Randstad, with a population 7.2 million inhabitants.</p>\\n<h3>City Centre</h3>\\n<p>The administration of the school, most of the faculties, and the majority of student housing are located in the historic City Centre of Amsterdam, within the canal ring which is itself a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The facilities in this area date from as early as the 15th century to the 21st-century. Architectural styles represented include the Dutch Renaissance, Dutch Baroque, Art Deco, Amsterdam School, and International style. The <i>Agnietenkapel</i>, <i>Maagdenhuis</i>, <i>Oost-Indisch Huis</i>, <i>Bushuis</i>, and <i>Oudemanhuispoort</i> are designated as <i>Rijksmonuments</i> (national monuments). The 15th century <i>Agnietenkapel</i>, where the university was founded was first constructed as a monastery chapel around 1470, but was later converted for use by the <i>Athenaeum Illustre</i> in 1631. The Agnes Gate in front of the <i>Agnietenkapel</i> is a major symbol of the university and dates back to 1571. It was renovated and moved to its current location in 1631. Another area is a former hospital converted into university buildings, the <i>Binnengasthuis</i>, which is considered the heart of UvA. The <i>Maagdenhuis</i> is the current headquarters of UvA and HvA administration. The building was built between 1783\\u20131787 and was formerly an orphanage. The <i>Oost-Indisch Huis</i>, the former headquarters of the Dutch East India Company was built in 1606 and now used by UvA. The <i>Oudemanhuispoort</i> was made a university building in 1880. It was constructed in 1602 as a retirement house and now houses the Faculty of Law. One of the buildings of the University Library complex, the <i>Bushuis</i>, was built as an armory in 1606.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Science Park</h3>\\n<p>The Faculty of Science is located on the east side of the city at the newly constructed Science Park Amsterdam. This 70 hectare campus contains UvA's science facilities, research institutes, student housing, the University Sports Centre, and businesses. In order to attract distinguished students and researchers, the campus was built by collaboration between the University of Amsterdam, the City of Amsterdam, and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research. In 2012, the Amsterdam University College will also be housed here.</p>\\n<h3>Academic Medical Centre</h3>\\n<p>In the southeastern Bijlmermeer neighbourhood, the Faculty of Medicine is housed in the Academic Medical Center (AMC), the Faculty of Medicine's teaching and research hospital.

Shortly after in 1988, the Emma Children's Hospital also moved to the AMC. It is one of Amsterdam's level 1 trauma centers and strongly cooperates with the VU University Medical Center (VUmc).</p>\\n<h3>Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam</h3>\\n<p>The Faculty of Dentistry is located in the Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA) in the southern <i>Zuidas</i> district on the campus of the VU University Medical Center. It was formed when the University of Amsterdam and the Vrije Universiteit combined their Dentistry schools in 1984.</p>\\n<h2>Organisation and administration</h2>\\n\\n<p>The University of Amsterdam is headed by an Executive Board that is charged with jointly governing the University of Amsterdam and its partner institution, the <i>Hogeschool van Amsterdam</i>. The university is then divided into seven faculties, with each faculty headed by a dean. Teaching and research are carried out in various departments and institutes within the individual faculties. UvA has an endowment of \\u20ac613.5 million (approximately $856.1 million), giving it the second-largest university endowment in the Netherlands.</p>\\n<p>The University of Amsterdam works in close collaboration with the <i>Hogeschool van Amsterdam</i>, allowing students from UvA and HvA to take classes at both schools through an integrated curriculum. In addition, the University of Amsterdam and VU University jointly preside over the Amsterdam University College (AUC), an interuniversity institute that offers a three-year Bachelor (Honors) program in the Liberal Arts and Sciences.</p>\\n<h3>International cooperation</h3>\\n<p>The intellectual and cultural atmosphere at UvA is internationally oriented. Amsterdam attracts students from the Netherlands and beyond: with over 2,500 international students and researchers from over 100 countries.</p>\\n<p>Close ties are harbored with other institutions internationally through its membership in the League of European Research Universities (LERU), the Institutional Network of the Universities from the Capitals of Europe (UNICA), European University Association (EUA), the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP), and Universitas 21.</p>\\n<p>UvA has an extensive network of foreign partner universities, facilitating student and staff exchanges. Within Europe, UvA has Socrates/Erasmus exchange agreements with over 200 institutions. Outside Europe, it has close ties with approximately 40 universities on all continents.</p>\\n<h2>Student life</h2>\\n\\n<p>At UvA, students can choose from many student organizations, athletic activities, and student services. These include the ASVA Student Union, CREA Cultural Center, the newly constructed University Sports Center, and the Agora and Atrium student restaurants. In addition, the university provides religious services, career counseling, the International Student Network (ISN), counseling, disability services, and student health services.

The building is located at the Prinsengracht, close to the Westerkerk, in central Amsterdam in the Netherlands.</p>\\n<p>During World War II, Anne Frank hid from Nazi persecution with her family and four other people in hidden rooms at the rear of the 17th-century canal house, known as the Secret Annex (Dutch: <i>Achterhuis</i>). Anne Frank did not survive the war, but in 1947 her wartime diary was published. In 1957, the Anne Frank Foundation was established to protect the property from developers who wanted to demolish the block.</p>\\n<p>The museum opened on 3 May 1960. It preserves the hiding place, has a permanent exhibition on the life and times of Anne Frank, and has an exhibition space about all forms of persecution and discrimination. In 2013, the museum had 1.2 million visitors and was the 3rd most visited museum in the Netherlands, after the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Building history</h2>\\n<h3>Canal house</h3>\\n\\n<p>The house \\u2014 and the one next door at number 265, which was later purchased by the museum \\u2014 was built by Dirk van Delft in 1635. The canal-side facade dates from a renovation of 1740 when the rear annex was demolished. It was originally a private residence, then a warehouse, and in the nineteenth century, the front warehouse with its wide stable-like doors was used to house horses. At the start of the 20th century a manufacturer of household appliances occupied the building, succeeded in 1930 by a producer of piano rolls, who vacated the property by 1939.</p>\\n<h3>World War II</h3>\\n<p>On 1 December 1940 Anne's father Otto Frank moved the offices of the spice and gelling companies he worked for, Opekta and Pectacon, from an address on Singel canal to Prinsengracht 263.</p>\\n<p>The ground floor consisted of three sections; the front was the goods and dispatch entrance, behind it in the middle section were the spice mills, and at the rear, which was the ground floor of the annex, was the warehouse where the goods were packed for distribution. On the first floor above were the offices of Frank's employees; Miep Gies, Bep Voskuijl and Johannes Kleiman in the front office; Victor Kugler in the middle; with Otto Frank in the rear office above the warehouse and below the floors which would later hide him and his family for two years until their betrayal to the Nazi authorities.</p>\\n<p>The <i>Achterhuis</i> (Dutch for \\\"back house\\\") or Secret Annex \\u2014 as it was called in <i>The Diary of a Young Girl</i>, an English translation of the diary \\u2014 is the rear extension of the building. It was concealed from view by houses on all four sides of a quadrangle. Its secluded position made it an ideal hiding place for Otto Frank, his wife Edith, two daughters (of whom Anne was the younger), and four other Jews seeking refuge from Nazi persecution. Though the total amount of floor space in the inhabited rooms came to only about 500 square feet (46\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>), Anne Frank wrote in her diary that it was relatively luxurious compared to other hiding places they had heard about. They remained hidden here for two years and one month until they were anonymously betrayed to the Nazi authorities, arrested, and deported to their deaths in concentration camps. Of the hidden group, only Otto Frank survived the concentration death camps.</p>\\n<p>After those in hiding were arrested, the hiding place was cleared by order of the arresting officers and all the remaining contents (clothes, furniture, and personal belongings) of the Frank family and their friends were seized and distributed to bombed-out families in Germany. Before the building was cleared, Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl, who had helped hide the families, returned to the hiding place against the orders of the Dutch police and rescued some personal effects. Amongst the items they retrieved was <i>The Diary of Anne Frank</i>.</p>\\n<h3>Publication of the diary</h3>\\n<p>After Otto Frank returned to Amsterdam, he was given Anne's diaries and papers, and subsequently compiled selections into a book published in Dutch in 1947 under the title <i>Het Achterhuis</i>, which Anne had chosen as the name of a future memoir or novel based on her experiences in hiding. Achterhuis is a Dutch architectural term referring to a Back-house (used comparatively with Voorhuis meaning Front-house), however when the English translation began production it was realised that many English-speaking readers might not be familiar with the term, and it was decided that a more evocative term (the 'Secret Annexe') would better convey the building's hidden position.</p>\\n<h2>Museum history</h2>\\n\\n<p>Shortly after the book was published, visitors were shown around by the employees who had hidden the families and could see the secret rooms. But by 1955 the company had moved to new premises and the entire block to which the building belonged was sold to a single estate agent who served a demolition order with the intention of building a factory on the space. A campaign to save the building and to list it as a protected monument was started by the Dutch paper <i>Het Vrije Volk</i> on 23 November 1955. The building was saved by campaigners who staged a protest outside the building on the day of demolition.</p>\\n<p>The Anne Frank Foundation was set up by Otto Frank and Johannes Kleiman on 3 May 1957 with the primary aim of collecting enough funds to purchase and restore the building. In October of that year the company who owned it donated the building to the Foundation as a goodwill gesture. The collected funds were then used to purchase the house next door, Number 265, shortly before the remaining buildings on the block were pulled down as planned. The building was opened as a museum to the public in 1960.</p>\\n<p>The former hiding place of Anne Frank attracted a huge amount of interest, especially as translations and dramatisations of the Diary had made her a figure known throughout the world. Over 9,000 visitors came in its first year. In a decade there were twice as many. Over the years the building has had to be renovated to manage such a large number of visitors, and so it closed temporarily in 1970 and in 1999.</p>\\n<p>On 28 September 1999 Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands reopened the museum, which now incorporated the entire building between exhibition spaces, a bookshop, and a cafe, and featured the offices in the front house reconstructed to their state in the 1940s. In 2007, over one million people visited the museum.</p>\\n<p>On display at the museum is the Academy Award that Shelley Winters won, and later donated to the museum, for her performance as Auguste van Pels in <i>The Diary of Anne Frank</i>. The award now sits in a bullet-proof glass case in the museum.</p>\\n<p>In 1998 the Anne Frank Zentrum in Berlin was opened, after the completion of a cooperation agreement with the Anne Frank House.</p>\\n<h2>Administration</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>Ronald Leopold has been executive director of the museum since 2011 and Garance Reus-Deelder has been managing director since 2012.</p>\\n<p>The museum had 1,152,888 visitors in 2012 and 1,195,456 visitors in 2013.

This is to promote new and upcoming artists as well as established artists. The presentation of media art also come in the form of symposiums, screenings and live performances of image and sound. Most events are within NIMks own facilities, but also in collaboration with other institutions and venues.</p>\\n<h3>Research</h3>\\n<p>NIMk supports artists researching into the use of new media in the visual arts by a programme called The Artist in Residence (AiR). The programme provides a residing artist with a studio, technical support and exhibition equipment to create new work. Some of the former and current artists in residence are\\u00a0: Dave Griffiths, Aymeric Mansoux and Marloes de Valk, Sonia Cillari, Knowbotic Research, Esther Polak, Linda Hilfling, Lilia Perez Romero, Chris Ziegler, Rob Davis &amp; Usman Haque, <i>Blender</i>, Linda Wallace, Simon Yuill, Jaromil, Kelli Dipple, Adam Hyde, Marjorieke Glaudemans &amp; Karen Lancel, Stansfield/Hooykaas.</p>\\n<p>NIMk also does research in documentation and preservation of media art. One project is the digitisation of video art work in collaboration with the Foundation for the Conservation of Contemporary Art (SBMK) and Virtueel Platform (VP). Between the years 2004 and 2007 NIMk participated in an international research project concerning preservation and documentation of installations called Inside Installations, from 2007 to 2010 it led the European project \\\"Gateways to Archives of Media Art\\\" (GAMA) providing access to a wealth of information about the works of both well-known and emerging artists from European collections of media art.</p>\\n<h3>Collection</h3>\\n\\n<p>NIMk has built up an extensive collection of video and media art for the last 30 years which constitutes one of the largest video art collections in Europe. The video collection consists of a distribution and a documentation collection, which are both available in the Mediatheque at NIMk. The catalogue is published online, with short excerpts of most of the works. This way the NIMk seeks to promote media art to a wider audience.</p>\\n<p>The distribution collection comprises more than 2000 works; varying form the earliest experiments through recent productions. These works are lend out for a wide range of purposes, like international and national festivals, exhibitions at various art institutions and for educational use. The distribution department presents video art, media art and installations to professionals and they organise and facilitate presentations of works from the collection. NIMk also maintains the collections of the Appel Foundation (De Appel), the former Lijnbaan Center in Rotterdam and the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage (ICN).</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>What was going to become NIMk, started out as MonteVideo, founded in 1978 by Ren\\u00e9 Coelho a former camera man. Ren\\u00e9 Coelho made an exhibition space in his own home as well as equipment and documentation available for artists. In 1983 MonteVideo moved to a bigger space in Amsterdam North and was now showing works of international as well as Dutch artists. The first artist to exhibit was Livinus van de Bundt. Later followed by artists such as Bert Schutter, Bill Viola, Gary Hill and Shelly Silver. MonteVideos collection of contemporary art kept growing into a large collection of works, which was rented out. Another organisation for new media art was founded that year, by Association of Video Artists, called Time Based Arts. For some time MonteVideo and Time Based Arts where competing against each other to get recognition and funding. From 1986-1993 Monte Videos government funding was reduced and Ren\\u00e9 Co\\u00eblho continued on his own. During this period the exhibition of Dutch media art \\\"Imago\\\" toured worldwide. In the meantime the death of Aart van Barneveld, the director of Time Based Arts, was followed by a lot of conflicts in between the associated artists in Time Based Arts, which almost resulted in the collapse of the organisation. But in 1990 Montevideo and Time based Arts decided to collaborate on a joint art program for Amsterdam cable TV called channel zero. The two organisations ended up merging in 1993 and became what it is today, Netherlands Media Art Institute. The merged Institute moved in 1994 to Spuistraat and in 1997 it moved to its current location on Keizersgracht in Amsterdam.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>http://www.mediaartplatform.nl/</li>\\n<li>http://www.deappel.nl</li>\\n<li>http://www.youtube.com/user/NIMkartchannel</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":1042.4,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":44125409,\"title\":\"Cornelis Hazevoet\",\"text\":\"<p>In 1970, he became secretary of the <i>Foundation Jazz in Nederland</i>, a Dutch jazz organisation.

Hendrikje's interest in discovering the history of this first bag triggered a passion for collecting handbags. Before too long she had collected more than 3,000 bags. She soon decided to show part of the collection to the public. At first, the museum existed in two rooms of a villa in Amstelveen, but as the collection grew, the couple looked for a new location. Since June 2007, the museum is located in a 17th Century patrician house at the Herengracht, Amsterdam's most prestigious canal.</p>\\n<p>Today, the Museum of Bags and Purses is a serious institution with a permanent exhibition presenting the core of the collection and temporary shows of the particular designers, mostly Dutch.</p>\\n<h2>Collection</h2>\\n<p>The earliest handbags in the museum's collection are typically small, used to carry coins, keys and sewing kits. Such bags were carried, by both men and women, under clothing to avoid drawing the attention of thieves. The development of pants with pockets for men, and the change from billowing skirts to more form-fitting dresses, led to handbags becoming an item for women, often with elaborate adornment.</p>\\n<p>With the coming of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, technology and the growth of rail travel accessible to the middle class led to larger handbags, often made of durable leather.</p>\\n<p>Brand name bags came to the fore in the 1950s, epitomized by items in the collection including a quilted Chanel purse and the Herm\\u00e8s Kelly bag.</p>\\n<h2>Exhibitions</h2>\\n<p>Besides the permanent collection, there are also temporary exhibitions. Till the 21st of February 2010 you can visit the exhibition: Made in Britain, with bags from English designers like Vivienne Westwood, Alexander McQueen, Lulu Guinness, Paul Smith and Anya Hindmarch. From the 8th of March 2010 the Museum of Bags and Purses will show the exhibition: CRYSTAL loves LEATHER. This collection was previously shown in New York, Tokyo, Antwerp and the Louvre in Paris.</p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>Simone Handbag Museum in Seoul</li>\\n</ul><ul><li>Esse Purse Museum</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n<ol class=\\\"references\\\"><li id=\\\"cite_note-Reuters-1\\\">^ <sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup> <sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup> <sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup> Yucel, Suzan. \\\"Handbag museum feeds female obsession\\\", <i>Reuters</i>, August 31, 2007.

Since 1988 The <i>Felix Meritis Foundation</i> has been located in the building as a European centre for art, culture and science.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>It was built according to a winning design by the architect Jacob Otten Husly for the new society called Felix Meritis established in 1776 for Music, Drawing, Physics, Commerce and Literature in the modern neo-classical style. Husly had won a similar design contest for the city hall of Groningen in the previous year. The building itself was meant to exemplify the Enlightenment ideals the society stood for. The classical temple fa\\u00e7ade with its colossal Corinthian pilasters and pediment represent the society's five departments with five sculptures representing the visual arts and architecture, literature, trade, natural sciences and music. The interior includes original 18th-century features such as the central staircase, the oval concert hall (renowned for its acoustics) and the domed roof - underneath which there used to be an astronomical observatory.</p>\\n<p>On October 31, 1788, the building of the same name opened its doors. The society focused on the promotion of arts and sciences in a broader sense than the artists collectives popular at the time. Husly was himself a board member of the Amsterdam city drawing academie \\\"Stadstekenacademie\\\", that had close contacts with the <i>Oeconomischen Tak van de Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen</i> (economics branch of the Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen, which met in the Trippenhuis). The society was abolished in 1888.</p>\\n<p>Felix Meritis\\u2019 oval concert hall was the main music hall in Amsterdam until late into the 19th century and enjoyed a great international reputation. Many famous musicians performed there, including Robert and Clara Schumann, Camille Saint-Sa\\u00ebns, Johannes Brahms and Julius R\\u00f6ntgen. The orchestra of Felix Meritis was regarded as the best of the Netherlands and accompanied many Dutch premieres, directed by conductors such as Johannes Bernardus van Bree. Thus, Beethoven\\u2019s Ninth Symphony and Berlioz\\u2019s Symphonie fantastique had their Dutch premiere in the concert hall of Felix Meritis. The small hall of the Concertgebouw is a replica of this concert hall.</p>\\n<h2>Twentieth century</h2>\\n\\n<p>When the old Felix Meritis society was dissolved in 1888, the printing company Holdert &amp; Co., which became one of Amsterdam's largest printing companies, moved into the building. In 1932 part of the building was destroyed in a fire. After the Second World War the Communist Party of the Netherlands set up its headquarters in the building. From 1947 until 1981 its newspaper 'De Waarheid' ('The Truth') rolled from the presses. In the 50s, Felix Meritis became the symbol of communism in the Netherlands. This image became especially embedded in the collective memory when the building was stormed on 4 November 1956, in response to the Soviet invasion of Hungary and its endorsement by the Dutch communist party. However, in the late sixties, Felix Meritis became a cradle of evenings for alternative youth, which were named Provadya. In 1969 the Shaffy Theater opened, which gained a reputation as a stopping place for the Dutch avant-garde, including Ramses Shaffy, Baal, Neerlands Hoop, Independent Theater and Hauser Orkater.</p>\\n<h2>Centre for art, culture and science</h2>\\n<p>In 1988, one hundred years after the old society was dissolved, <i>The Felix Meritis foundation</i> was re-established in the building as a European center for art, culture and science. Felix Meritis is an independent international meeting place and serves as director of the European public debate, cultural processes and international projects and exchanges. Felix Meritis presents itself as a knowledge institution and platform for European cultural dialogue and cultural-political issues. The motto of Felix Meritis is Connecting Cultures. In collaboration with partners from home and abroad Felix Meritis initiates projects such as <i>A Soul for Europe, Amsterdam Forum, The People Network, Gulliver Connect, Amsterdam Summer University, Dare2Connect, The European House for Culture (Brussels), Night of Philosophy, Cafe Europa, The Globalization Lecture Foundation and Kuhnya.</i></p>\\n<h3>Director Felix Meritis</h3>\\n\\n<p>Linda Bouws, MA Theatre Studies, has been the director of The Felix Meritis Foundation, European Centre for Arts, Culture and Science in Amsterdam since 2002.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>Felix Meritis is \\\"window number 23\\\" of the <i>Canon van Amsterdam</i>, by Piet de Rooy &amp; Emma Los, Uitgeverij Boom, Amsterdam, 2008, ISBN 9789085066835</li>\\n</ul><h2>Literature</h2>\\n<ul><li>Loes Gompes &amp; Merel Ligtelijn, Mirror of Amsterdam - History of Felix Meritis, 2007, Rozenberg Publishers</li>\\n</ul><h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Website Felix Meritis</li>\\n<li>Website city of Amsterdam - monument Felix Meritis</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":1115.4,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":29640989,\"title\":\"Joost Ritman\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Joost R.

When he conceived the plan to turn his private collection of books into a library, his vision was to bring together under one roof manuscripts and printed works in the field of the Hermetic tradition, and to show the interrelatedness between the various collecting areas and their relevance for the present day.  Following a difficult year in the shadow of the financial crisis and cuts, The Ritman Library reopened its doors on December 16th 2011. </p>\\n<h2>Future</h2>\\n<p>The library is currently focussing on reshaping the once privately funded library into a self-sustaining and public institution, and on preparing the move to the Huis met de Hoofden (House with the Heads) in the autumn of 2015.

The area is bordered by the Lijnbaansgracht canal to the west, the Prinsengracht to the east, the Brouwersgracht to the north and the Leidsegracht to the south. The former canal Rozengracht (now filled in) is the main traffic artery through the neighbourhood.</p>\\n<p>Originally a working-class neighbourhood, the Jordaan has become one of the most expensive, upscale locations in the Netherlands. It is home to many art galleries, particularly for modern art, and is also dotted with speciality shops and restaurants. Markets are held regularly at Noordermarkt, the Westerstraat (the Lapjesmarkt textile market) and Lindengracht.</p>\\n<p>Rembrandt spent the last years of his life in the Jordaan, on the Rozengracht canal. He was buried in the Westerkerk church, at the corner of Rozengracht and Prinsengracht, just beyond the Jordaan. The Anne Frank House, where Anne Frank went into hiding during World War II, is located on the edge of the Jordaan, on the Prinsengracht canal.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Origin of the name</h2>\\n<p>The most common theory on the origin of the name is as a derivation of the French word <i>jardin</i>, meaning garden: most streets and canals in the Jordaan are named after trees and flowers. Another theory is that the Prinsengracht canal was once nicknamed Jordaan (the Dutch name for the river Jordan), and that the neighbourhood beyond the canal came to be called this as well.</p>\\n<h2>Buildings</h2>\\n<p>The Jordaan has a high concentration of <i>hofjes</i> (inner courtyards), many of them with restored houses and peaceful gardens. These courtyards were built by rich people for elderly women, as a kind of charity. By the 1970s most of these courtyards were in very bad shape, like the rest of the neighbourhood. Since then, many have been restored and are now inhabited mainly by artists, students and some elderly people. During the summer some of these yards are opened on Sundays during free concerts known as <i>hofjesconcerten</i>.</p>\\n<p>Many houses in the Jordaan have a stone tablet on their facade, a stone sign displaying the profession or family sign of the inhabitants. For instance a butcher displayed a pig and a tailor a pair of scissors, carved in stone above the entry. The first such stone tablets were made in the 16th century, when citizens were ordered to use these tablets instead of big wooden gables that obstructed the traffic in the narrow streets.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>Construction of the Jordaan began in 1612, when it was called <i>Het Nieuwe Werck</i> (The New Work). The streets and canals were built according to the old ditches and paths, which explains its unusual orientation compared to the rest of the city. In the 19th century, six of the Jordaan's canals were filled in, including the Rozengracht.</p>\\n<p>The neighbourhood was traditionally a leftwing stronghold, with a stormy history. Heavy riots broke out in 1835, 1886, 1917 and 1934. The February strike of 1941 started with meetings on Noordermarkt square.</p>\\n<p>The Jordaan had a lively music scene in the 20th century. Several of the most popular musicians now have a statue in their memory at the corner of Prinsengracht and Elandsgracht. The singer Willy Alberti is commemorated with a memorial plaque on the Westerkerk church. The Jordaanfestival, celebrating the neighbourhood's music tradition, is held annually.</p>\\n<p>Starting in the 1960s, many of the neighbourhood's original working-class residents moved out of the city to more affordable locations, mainly to Almere and Purmerend.</p>\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Jordaan INFO</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":1250.9,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":39413531,\"title\":\"Sandra Meigs\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Sandra Meigs</b>, (born 1953, Baltimore, MD, USA) is a Canadian visual artist based in British Columbia, Canada.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q16185469\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":0},{\"pageid\":3778189,\"title\":\"Wim T.

Carel Fodor first bought the Keizersgracht 611. Later he also bought the adjacent warehouse and residential house.</p>\\n<p>Fodor started to collect paintings, drawings and prints from 1834 onwards. His preference went out to contemporary art, works by 'living masters'. Fodor quickly opened up his house to the general public, where many art lovers visited to see his collection by appointment.</p>\\n<p>When Fodor died, he bequeathed his collection to the city of Amsterdam. He also left behind a large sum of money to turn his house into a museum. Fodor destined Keizersgracht 609, the warehouse, in his testament as the exhibition space that should receive the name Museum Fodor. It should become a permanent exhibition space for his personal collection.</p>\\n\\n<p>The building was renovated in 1861 by Cornelis Oudhoorn. In 1863, Museum Fodor opened its doors as the first museum of modern art. In the early years the museum attracted a large number of visitors, but as the years passed by these numbers dwindled.</p>\\n<p>In 1948 the collection was stored in a depot and the museum became a separate location of the Stedelijk Museum. In 1963 the complete collection was taken over by the Amsterdams Historisch Museum.</p>\\n<p>Museum Fodor was dissolved on 1 January 1993.</p>\\n<h2>Building</h2>\\n\\n<p>Museum Fodor was located at Keizersgracht 609 near the Leidsestraat in the center of the canal district in the borough Amsterdam-Centrum.</p>\\n<p>The museum building was originally a canal-side warehouse. In 1860, it was owned by Carel Joseph Fodor. In 1861\\u201362, after Fodor's death, the building was turned into a museum by a design of architect Cornelis Outshoorn. The building was elevated with a Italianate facade, made of sandstone, with a straight cornice.</p>\\n<p>The building has been a <i>rijksmonument</i> (national heritage site) since 1970.</p>\\n<p>From 1994 to 2001, the Dutch Design Institute was housed in the building. Since 2001, the Foam Fotografiemuseum Amsterdam is located here.</p>\\n<h2>Collection</h2>\\n<p>The collection of Museum Fodor consisted of the large collection of paintings, prints, and drawings that Carel Joseph Fodor bequeathed to the city of Amsterdam. Among the paintings was <i>Christus Consolator</i> (1837) by Ary Scheffer, which Fodor had bought from the collection of the Duchess of Orl\\u00e9ans.

The museum has four different exhibitions at any given time in which different photographic genres are shown, such as documentary, art and fashion. Two notable shows were <i>Henri Cartier-Bresson - A Retrospective</i>, work by Henri Cartier-Bresson, and <i>Richard Avedon - Photographs 1946 -2004</i>, a major retrospective of Richard Avedon. Next to large exhibitions by well-known photographers, Foam also shows the work of young and upcoming photographers, in shorter running exhibitions. The museum contains a caf\\u00e9, a library, a commercial gallery called FoamEditions and a bookshop.</p>\\n<p>The museum also publishes a quarterly photography magazine called Foam Magazine.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Building</h2>\\n\\n<p>The building on the Keizersgracht canal in which Foam is located has a history dating back to Carel Joseph Fodor (1801\\u20131860). Fodor first bought Keizersgracht 611, and later also bought the adjacent warehouse and residential house at Keizersgracht 609. Fodor destined the warehouse in his testament as the exhibition space that should receive the name Museum Fodor. Between 1863 and 1994, Museum Fodor was open to the public. Between 1994 and 2001 the Nederlands Vormgevingsinstituut was located in these buildings.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>Foam received permission in November 2001 from the city council for the start-up. On December 13, 2001, Foam opened its first exhibition <i>Dutch Delight</i>. More than 7000 people visited the exhibition in which Dutch light played a prominent or self-evident role.</p>\\n<p>After the opening exhibition the museum closed for renovation. Architects BenthemCrouwel turned three buildings at the Keizersgracht into a modern museum. The first exhibition in the new museum, was called <i>Regie: Paul Huf</i>, Paul Huf together with Eva Besny\\u00f6 being the originator of the museum. The official opening took place on June 6, 2002. The exhibition was visited by approximately 8000 people.</p>\\n<h2>Exhibition policy</h2>\\n<p>Every year Foam organises four large exhibitions by particularly notable photographers, usually running for about three months. In conjunction about 16 shorter running exhibitions are organised by the museum, which can be very different in character: either the work of relatively young photographers, or a specific project, work that is currently relevant, small retrospectives or the presentation of new developments within the medium. Emphasis is generally on documentary photography, street photography, portrait and glamour photography, and young and upcoming talents.</p>\\n<p>Documentary photography exhibitions at Foam have included <i>Avenue Patrice Lumumba</i> by Guy Tillim, <i>The Hyena &amp; Other Men</i> by Pieter Hugo, and <i>In the Shadow of Things</i> by Leonie Purchas. Street photography exhibitions have included Helen Levitt's <i>In the Street</i>, a retrospective by Weegee and Tom Wood\\u2019s <i>Photieman</i>. Portrait or glamour exhibitions have included <i>Photographs 1946-2004</i> by Richard Avedon, <i>Chemises</i> by Malick Sidib\\u00e9, and <i>People of the 20th Century</i> by August Sander. Under the denominator <i>Foam_3h</i> small shows by young photographers are presented in the Foam library. Recent examples include <i>Control</i> by Emilie Hudig and <i>A Place to Wash the Heart</i> by Monieka Bielskyte.</p>\\n<h2>Foam Paul Huf Award</h2>\\n<p>Since 2007, Foam has been organising the Paul Huf Award, a prize that is awarded to a young, talented photographer under the age of 35.

Metz is the capital and the prefecture of both the Lorraine region and the Moselle department. Located near the tripoint along the junction of France, Germany, and Luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the European Greater Region and the SaarLorLux euroregion.</p>\\n<p>Metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a Celtic oppidum, an important Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of the Austrasia kingdom, the birthplace of the Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics of the common era in Europe. The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture due to its location and history.</p>\\n<p>Because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, Metz has been submitted on the France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. The city features noteworthy buildings such as the Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains being the oldest church in France, its Imperial Station Palace displaying the apartment of the German Kaiser, or its Opera House, the oldest one working in France. Metz is home to some world-class venues including the Arsenal Concert Hall and the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum.</p>\\n<p>A basin of urban ecology, Metz gained its nickname of The Green City (French: <i>La Ville Verte</i>), as it has extensive open grounds and public gardens. The historic city centre is one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France.</p>\\n<p>A historic garrison town, Metz is the economic heart of the Lorraine region, specialising in information technology and automotive industries. Metz is home to the University of Lorraine and a centre for applied research and development in the materials sector, notably in metallurgy and metallography, the heritage of the Lorraine region's past in the iron and steel industry.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Etymology</h2>\\n<p>In ancient times, the town was known as \\\"city of Mediomatrici\\\", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called <i>Divodurum Mediomatricum,</i> meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici, then it was known as <i>Mediomatrix</i>. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to \\\"Mettis\\\", which gave rise to Metz.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n<p>Metz has a recorded history dating back over 3,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz rose to the status of Republic and the Republic of Metz ruled until the 15th century. With the signature of the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz was passed to the hands of the Kings of France. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the Three Bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. With creation of the departments by the Estates-General of 1789, Metz was chosen as capital of the Department of Moselle. After the defeat of France during the Franco-Prussian War and according to the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the German Empire, being part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine and serving as capital of the German Department of Lorraine. Metz remained German until the end of World War I, when it reverted to France. However, after the Battle of France during the Second World War, the city was annexed once more by the German Third Reich. In 1944, the attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army freed the city from German rule and Metz reverted one more time to France after World War II.</p>\\n<p>During the 1950s, Metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created Lorraine region. With the creation of the European Community and the later European Union, the city has became central to the Greater Region and the SaarLorLux Euroregion.</p>\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n\\n<p>Metz is located on the banks of the Moselle and the Seille rivers, 43\\u00a0km (26.7\\u00a0mi) from the Schengen tripoint where the borders of France, Germany, and Luxembourg meet. The city was built in a place where many branches of the Moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning.</p>\\n<p>The terrain of Metz forms part of the Paris Basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north-south direction. Metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop Lorraine Regional Natural Park, covering a total area of 205,000\\u00a0ha (506,566.0 acres).</p>\\n<h3>Climate</h3>\\n<p>The climate of Lorraine is a semi-continental climate. The summers are humid and hot, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is August, when temperatures average approximately 26\\u00a0\\u00b0C (78.8\\u00a0\\u00b0F).

The median cloud cover is 93% and does not vary substantially over the course of the year.</p>\\n<h2>Demographics</h2>\\n\\n<h3>Population</h3>\\n<p>The inhabitants of Metz are called <i>Messin(e)s</i>. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking.</p>\\n<p>The French national census of 2009 estimated the population of Metz to be 121,841, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:</p>\\n<center>\\n</center>\\n<center>\\n</center>\\n<h3>Notable people linked to the city</h3>\\n\\n<p>Several well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned <i>Messins</i> include poet Paul Verlaine, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer Fran\\u00e7ois Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero the Marquis de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.</p>\\n<h2>Law and government</h2>\\n<h3>Local law</h3>\\n\\n<p>The Local Law (French: <i>droit local</i>) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.</p>\\n<p>The most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.</p>\\n<h3>Administration</h3>\\n<p>Like every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor (French: <i>maire</i>) and a municipal council (French: <i>conseil municipal</i>), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years. The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors, and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month. Since 2008, the mayor of Metz has been socialist Dominique Gros.</p>\\n<p>The city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz urban agglomeration. Metz is the seat of government of Lorraine region and the prefecture of the Moselle, based in the former Saint-Clement Abbey and Intendant Palace, respectively.</p>\\n<h3>City administrative divisions</h3>\\n<p>The city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:</p>\\n<center>\\n</center>\\n\\n<h2>Cityscape and environmental policy</h2>\\n<p>Metz contains a mishmash of architectural layers, bearing witness to centuries of history at the crossroads of different cultures, and features a number of architectural landmarks. The city possesses one of the largest Urban Conservation Areas in France, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the Monument Historique list. Because of its historical and cultural background, Metz is designated as French Town of Art and History, and has been submitted on to France's UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.</p>\\n<p>The city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of Jaumont stone. The historic district has kept part of the Gallo-Roman city with Divodurum's Cardo Maximus, then called Via Scarponensis (today the Trinitaires, Taison, and Serpenoise streets), and the Decumanus Maximus (today En Fournirue and d'Estr\\u00e9es streets). At the Cardo and Decumanus intersection was situated the Roman forum, today the Saint-Jacques Square.</p>\\n<h3>Civilian architecture</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>From its Gallo-Roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the Golden Courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the Basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains.</p>\\n<p>Saint Louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a Knights Templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's High Medieval heritage. The Gothic Saint-Stephen Cathedral, several churches and H\\u00f4tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the Late Middle Ages. Examples of Renaissance architecture can be seen in H\\u00f4tels from the 16th century, such as the House of Heads (French: <i>Maison des T\\u00eates</i>).</p>\\n<p>The city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by French architect Jacques-Fran\\u00e7ois Blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of Metz by the Royal Academy of Architecture in 1755 the context of the Enlightenment. Neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the Opera House, the Intendant Palace (the present-day prefecture), and the Royal Governor's Palace (the present-day courthouse) built by Charles-Louis Cl\\u00e9risseau, are also found in the city.</p>\\n<p>The Imperial District was built during the first annexation of Metz by the German Empire. In order to \\\"germanise\\\" the city, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of Germanic architecture, including Renaissance, neo-Romanesque and neo-Classical, mixed with elements of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Alsatian and mock-Bavarian styles. Instead of Jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the Rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. The district features noteworthy buildings including the impressive station and the Central Post Office by German architect J\\u00fcrgen Kr\\u00f6ger.</p>\\n<p>Modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of French architects Roger-Henri Expert (Sainte-Th\\u00e9r\\u00e8se-de-l'Enfant-J\\u00e9sus church, 1934), Georges-Henri Pingusson (Fire Station, 1960), and Jean Dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). The refurbishment of the former Ney Arsenal as a Concert Hall in 1989 and the erection of the Metz Arena in 2002, by Spanish and French architects Ricardo Bofill and French Paul Chemetov represent the Postmodern movement.</p>\\n<p>The Centre Pompidou-Metz museum in the Amphitheatre District represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of Metz into the 21st century. Designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. The project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Shigeru Ban (2014) and French Christian de Portzamparc (1994). The Amphitheatre District is also conceived by French architects Nicolas Michelin and Jean-Paul Viguier and designer Philippe Starck. The urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. Further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist French architect Rudy Ricciotti stands in the Borny District.</p>\\n<h3>Urban ecology</h3>\\n\\n<p>Under the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. Because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in Europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of CIAM, Jean-Marie Pelt, then municipal councillor of Metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment.</p>\\n<p>Based initially on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between \\\"stone and water\\\". His policy was realized in Metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. As a result Metz has over 37\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> (400\\u00a0sq\\u00a0ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city.</p>\\n<p>The principles of urban ecology are still applied in Metz with the implementation of a local Agenda 21 action plan. The municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture.</p>\\n<p>Additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.</p>\\n<h3>Military architecture</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>As a historic Garrison town, Metz has been heavily influenced by military architecture throughout its history. From ancient history to the present, the city has been successively fortified and modified to accommodate the troops stationed there. Defensive walls from classical antiquity to the 20th century are still visible today, incorporated into the design of public gardens along the Moselle and Seille rivers. A medieval bridge castle from the 13th century, named Germans' Gate (French: <i>Porte des Allemands</i>), today converted into a convention and exhibition centre, has become one of the landmarks of the city. Remains of the citadel from the 16th century and fortifications built by Louis de Cormontaigne are still visible today. Important barracks, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, are spread around the city: some, which are of architectural interest, have been converted to civilian use, such as the Arsenal Concert Hall by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill.</p>\\n<p>The extensive fortifications of Metz, which ring the city, include early examples of S\\u00e9r\\u00e9 de Rivi\\u00e8res system forts. Other forts were incorporated into the Maginot Line. A hiking trail on the Saint-Quentin plateau passes through a former military training zone and ends at the now abandoned military forts, providing a vantage point from which to survey the city.</p>\\n<h2>Economy</h2>\\n<p>Although the steel industry has historically dominated Moselle's economy, Metz's efforts at economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of commerce, tourism, information technology and the automotive industry. The city is the economic heart of the Lorraine region and around 73,000 people work daily within the urban agglomeration. The transport facilities found in the conurbation, including the international high-speed railway, motorway, inland connections and the local bus rapid transit system, have made the city a transport hub in the heart of the European Union. Metz is home to the biggest harbour handling cereals in France with over 4,000,000 tons/year.</p>\\n<p>Metz is home to the Moselle Chamber of Commerce. International companies such as PSA Peugeot Citro\\u00ebn, ArcelorMittal, SFR, and TDF have established plants and centres in the Metz conurbation. Metz is also the regional headquarters of the Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire banking groups.</p>\\n<p>Metz is an important commercial centre of northern France with France's biggest retailer federation, consisting of around 2,000 retailers. Important store companies are found in the city, such as the Galeries Lafayette, the Printemps department store and the Fnac entertainment retail chain. The historic city centre displays one of the largest commercial pedestrian areas in France and a mall, the Saint-Jacques centre. In addition there are several multiplex movie theatres and malls found in the urban agglomeration.</p>\\n<p>In recent years, Metz municipality have promoted an ambitious policy of tourism development, including urban revitalization and refurbishment of buildings and public squares. This policy has been spurred by the creation of the Centre Pompidou-Metz in 2010. Since its inauguration, the institution has become the most popular cultural venue in France outside Paris, with 550,000 visitors per year. Meanwhile Saint-Stephen Cathedral is the most visited building in the city, accommodating 652,000 visitors per year.</p>\\n<h2>Culture and contemporary life</h2>\\n\\n<h3>Museums and exhibition halls</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>The Centre Pompidou-Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary arts, the largest temporary exhibition area in France outside Paris. The museum features exhibitions from the extensive collection of the Centre Pompidou, Europe's largest collection of 20th-century art. The Centre Pompidou-Metz displays around three to four unique temporary exhibitions per year. In addition to the temporary exhibitions, the Centre Pompidou-Metz features seasonal programming with contemporary live shows in its theater, and organizes meetings and conferences in its auditorium with world famous as well as local artists.</li>\\n</ul><ul><li>Saint Stephen's Cathedral is the Gothic cathedral of the city built during the 13th century. The cathedral exhibits the collection of the Bishopric of Metz, including paraments and items used in the service of the Eucharist. Metz Cathedral is sometimes nicknamed the Good Lord's Lantern (French: <i>la Lanterne du Bon Dieu</i>), as it has the largest expanse of stained glass windows in the world: 6,500\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> (70,000\\u00a0sq\\u00a0ft). These include works by Gothic and Renaissance master glass makers Hermann von M\\u00fcnster, Th\\u00e9obald of Lixheim, and Valentin Bousch, romantic Charles-Laurent Mar\\u00e9chal, tachist Roger Bissi\\u00e8re, cubist Jacques Villon and modernist Marc Chagall.</li>\\n</ul><ul><li>Another of the city's churches displays a complete set of stained glass windows by French modernist Jean Cocteau.</li>\\n</ul><p>In addition, Metz features other museums and exhibition venues, such as:</p>\\n<ul><li>The FRAC Lorraine, a public collection of contemporary art of the Lorraine region. It is located in the 12th-century Saint-Liver H\\u00f4tel and organizes exhibitions of local and international contemporary artists.</li>\\n</ul><ul><li>The Golden Courtyard (French: <i>la Cour d'Or</i>), a museum dedicated to the history of Metz, divided into four sections (e.g. archeology, medieval, architecture, and fine arts). The Golden Courtyard displays a rich collection of Gallo-Roman and medieval finds and the remains of the Gallo-Roman baths of <i>Divodurum Mediomatricum</i>, revealed by the extension works to the museums in the 1930s.</li>\\n</ul><ul><li>The Museum of the 1870 War and of the Annexion in Gravelotte, a village located within the Metz-Metropole conurbation and the site of the Battle of Gravelotte, the only museum in Europe dedicated to the Franco-Prussian War. The museum exhibits military and everyday items from the period as well as artworks related to the 1870 war. A mausoleum erected in 1904 honoring the soldiers who died during the battle, the Memorial Hall (French: <i>La Halle du Souvenir</i>), has been included in the museum.</li>\\n</ul><ul><li>The House for Europe, located on the estate of Robert Schuman in Scy-Chazelles in the Metz-Metropole conurbation, transformed into a museum and convention centre. Across the street is the fortified 12th Century church where Robert Schuman now rests. The Robert Schuman House for Europe organises cultural and educational events that introduce the visitor to Schuman's life and works and to the way Europe has been constructed and continues to develop today.</li>\\n</ul><ul><li>Verlaine's House (French: <i>la Maison de Verlaine</i>) is a museum located in the house where the poet Paul Verlaine was born, dedicated to his work, featuring permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Solange Bertrand foundation, located in the artist's former house, conserves and displays her artworks. The municipal archives preserve and exhibit Metz's historical municipal records dating from medieval times to the present.</li>\\n</ul><h3>Entertainment and performing arts</h3>\\n<p>Metz has several venues for the performing arts. The Opera House of Metz, the oldest working opera house in France, features plays, dance, and lyric poetry. The Arsenal Concert Hall, dedicated to art music, is widely renowned for its excellent acoustics and considered as one of the most beautiful concert halls in Europe. The Trinitarians Club is a multi-media arts complex housed in the vaulted cellar and chapel of an ancient convent, the city's prime venue for jazz music. The Music Box (French: <i>Boite \\u00e0 Musique</i>), familiarly known as BAM, is the concert venue dedicated to rock and electronic music. The Braun Hall and the Kolt\\u00e8s Theater feature plays, and the city has two movie theaters specializing in Auteur cinema. The Saint-Jacques Square, surrounded by busy bars and pubs whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square, contributes to the quality of life in Metz, as do numerous other associations, private music bars and theaters.</p>\\n<p>Since 2014, the former bus garage has been converted to accommodate over thirty artists in residence, in a space where they can create and rehearse artworks and even build set decorations. The artistic complex, called Metz Network of All Cultures (French: <i>Toutes les Cultures en R\\u00e9seau \\u00e0 Metz</i>) and familiarly known as TCRM-Blida, encompasses a large hall of 3,000\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> (32,000\\u00a0sq\\u00a0ft) while theater and dance companies benefit from a studio of 800\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> (8,600\\u00a0sq\\u00a0ft) with backstages.</p>\\n<h3>Metz in the arts</h3>\\n<p>Metz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance. For example, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.</p>\\n<p>The Metz School (French: <i>\\u00c9cole de Metz</i>) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred on Charles-Laurent Mar\\u00e9chal. The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eug\\u00e8ne Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Mar\\u00e9chal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Th\\u00e9odore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles P\\u00eatre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.</p>\\n<h3>The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city</h3>\\n\\n<p>The Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on. Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.</p>\\n<h3>Cuisine</h3>\\n<p>Local specialties include the quiche, the pot\\u00e9e, the Lorrain p\\u00e2t\\u00e9, and also the suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, are made from the Mirabelle and Damson plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (French: <i>boulet de Metz</i>), a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.</p>\\n<p>The Covered Market of Metz is one of the oldest, most grandiose in France and is home to traditional local food producers and retailers. Originally built as the bishop's palace, the French Revolution broke out before the Bishop of Metz could move in and the citizens decided to turn it into a food market. The adjacent Chamber's Square (French: <i>Place de la Chambre</i>) is surrounded by numerous local food restaurants.</p>\\n<h3>Celebrations and events</h3>\\n<p>Many events are celebrated in Metz throughout the year. The city of Metz dedicates two weeks to the Mirabelle plum during the popular Mirabelle Festival held in August. During the festival, in addition to open markets selling fresh plums, mirabelle tarts, and mirabelle liquor, there are live music, fireworks, parties, art exhibits, a parade with floral floats, a competition, the crowning of the Mirabelle Queen and a gala of celebration.</p>\\n<p>A literature festival is held in June. The Montgolfiades hot air balloon festival is organized in September. The second most popular Christmas Market in France is held in November and December. Finally, a Saint Nicholas parade honors the patron saint of the Lorraine region in December.</p>\\n<h3>Sports</h3>\\n<p>Metz is home to the Football Club of Metz (FC Metz), a football association club in Ligue 1, the highest division of French football. FC Metz has won three times the Ligue 2 (1935, 2007, and 2014), twice the Coupe de France (in 1984 and 1988) and the French League Cup (in 1986 and 1996), and was French championship runner-up in 1998. FC Metz has also gained recognition in France and Europe for its successful youth academy, winning the Gambardella Cup 3 times in 1981, 2001, and 2010.

Some of these institutions offer higher education programs such as classes pr\\u00e9paratoires (undergraduate school) or BTS (technician certificate).</p>\\n<h3>University of Lorraine</h3>\\n\\n<p>Metz is also home to the University of Lorraine (often abbreviated in UdL). The university is divided into two university centers, one in Metz (material sciences, technology, and management) and one in Nancy (biological sciences, health care, administration, and management). The University of Lorraine has a student body of over 55,000 and offers 101 accredited research centers organized in 9 research areas and 8 doctoral colleges. The Metz campus, built on three different sites within the city, enjoys a privileged position at a hub open to Germany and the Benelux countries, and has gained recognition for the development of joint Franco-German curricula. The University of Lorraine was ranked 11th among French universities in 2013 and is among the top 300 universities in the world, according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities.</p>\\n<h3>Graduate schools</h3>\\n<p>At the end of the 1990s, the city expanded and the Metz Science Park was created in the southern area. Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like Sup\\u00e9lec in 1985 and Georgia Tech Lorraine in 1990. In 1996, the engineering school Arts et M\\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course. This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine. For instance, the university and ENSAM share research teams, laboratories, equipments, and doctoral programs.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n\\n\\n<h3>Local transport</h3>\\n<p>Public transport includes a bus rapid transit system, called Mettis. Mettis vehicles are high-capacity hybrid bi-articulated buses built by Van Hool, and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with disability access. Mettis has its own planned and integrated transportation system, which includes two dedicated lines that spread out into the Metz conurbation. Mettis lanes A and B serve the city's major facilities (e.g. city centre, university campus, and hospitals), and a transport hub is located next to the railway station.</p>\\n<h3>Railways</h3>\\n\\n<p>Metz Railway Station is connected to the French high speed train (TGV) network, which provides a direct rail service to Paris and Luxembourg. The time from Paris (Gare de l'Est) to Metz is 82 minutes. Additionally, Metz is served by the Lorraine TGV railway station, located at Louvigny, 25\\u00a0km (16\\u00a0mi)to the south of Metz, for high speed trains going to Nantes, Rennes, Lille and Bordeaux (without stopping in Paris). Also, Metz is one of the main stations of the regional express trains system, M\\u00e9trolor.</p>\\n<h3>Motorways</h3>\\n<p>Metz is located at the intersection of two major road axes: the Eastern Motorway, itself a part of the European route E50 connecting Paris to Prague, and the A31 Motorway, which goes north to Luxembourg and south to the Mediterranean Sea towards Nancy, Dijon, and Lyon.</p>\\n<h3>Airports</h3>\\n<p>The Luxembourg International Airport is the nearest international airport, connected to Metz by M\\u00e9trolor train.

It connects the banks of the river at Kerkstraat (Church Street), between Keizersgracht (Emperors' Canal) and Prinsengracht (Princes' Canal).</p>\\n<p>The central section of the Magere Brug is a bascule bridge made of white-painted wood. The present bridge was built in 1934. The first bridge at this site was built in 1691 as Kerkstraatbrug and had 13 arches. Because this bridge was very narrow, the locals called it <i>magere brug</i>, which literally means \\\"skinny bridge\\\". In 1871 the state of the bridge was so bad that it was demolished and replaced by a nine-arched wooden bridge. Fifty years later this bridge also needed to be replaced. Architect Piet Kramer made several designs for a steel and stone bridge, but the city decided to replace it with a new bridge that looked the same as the previous, only slightly bigger. In 1934 the bridge was demolished and replaced. The last major renovation was in 1969. Until 1994 the bridge was opened by hand, but now is opened automatically.</p>\\n<p>Use of the bridge has been limited to pedestrians and cyclists since 2003. It is however opened many times a day in order to let through river traffic. The boats used for sightseeing tours are low enough to pass underneath the bridge when closed. The bridge is decorated with 1200 light bulbs that are turned on in the evening.</p>\\n<p>A story told to tourists about the origins of the 1691 version of the bridge is that it was built by two wealthy sisters who lived on opposite sides of the Amstel river and wanted to be able to visit one another every day (and were presumably too busy, or not in good enough health, to go the long way round via another bridge, of which there must surely have been at least one). In one variant of the story the sisters, although wealthy, were not quite wealthy enough to afford a bridge of adequate width for general use and so built a very narrow bridge, hence its name. In another variant of the story the sisters' last name was Mager, hence the bridge's name (rather than from its narrowness).</p>\\n<p>The bridge can be seen in a number of films, such as the James Bond film <i>Diamonds Are Forever</i> from 1971.</p>\\n<h2>Gallery</h2>\\n<ul class=\\\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\\\"><li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n</ul><h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>360\\u00b0 panorama</li>\\n<li>Images of the Bridge</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\"},{\"dim\":10000,\"dist\":1370.3,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":21422764,\"title\":\"Harry van Bommel\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Henricus (Harry) van Bommel</b> (born June 24, 1962 in Helmond) is a Dutch politician, anti-globalization activist and former educator.

The principal form of government is the municipality of Amsterdam, Netherlands. The municipality's territory covers the city of Amsterdam as well as a number of small towns. The city of Amsterdam is also part of several functional forms of regional government. These include the Waterschap (<i>water board</i>) of Amstel, Gooi en Vecht, which is responsible for water management, and the <i>Stadsregio</i> (City Region) of Amsterdam, which has responsibilities in the areas of spatial planning and public transport.</p>\\n<p>The municipality of Amsterdam borders the municipalities of Diemen, Weesp, Abcoude, Ouder-Amstel and Amstelveen in the south, Haarlemmermeer and Haarlemmerliede en Spaarnwoude in the west, and Zaanstad, Oostzaan, Landsmeer and Waterland in the north.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Municipal government</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>The city of Amsterdam is a municipality under the Dutch Municipalities Act. It is governed by a municipal council (<i>gemeenteraad</i>, also known as 'city council', the principal legislative authority), a municipal executive board (<i>college van burgemeester en wethouders</i>), and a mayor (<i>burgemeester</i>). The mayor is both a member of the municipal executive board and an individual authority with a number of statutory responsibilities, mainly in the area of maintaining public order. The municipal council has 45 seats. Its members are elected for a four-year term through city-wide elections on the basis of proportional representation. Under the Municipalities Act, the mayor is appointed for a six-year term by the national government upon nomination by the municipal council. The other members of the executive board (<i>wethouders</i>, or 'alderpersons') are appointed directly by the municipal council, but may be dismissed at any time after a no-confidence vote in the council. Because of this parliamentary system, the alderpersons are not appointed until a governing majority in the council has reached a coalition agreement following council elections.</p>\\n<p>In July 2010, Eberhard van der Laan (Labour Party) was appointed mayor of Amsterdam by the national government for a six-year term after being nominated by the Amsterdam municipal council. After the 2014 municipal council elections, a governing majority of D66, VVD and SP was formed - the first coalition without the Labour Party since World War II. Next to the mayor, the municipal executive board consists of eight <i>wethouders</i> ('alderpersons') appointed by the municipal council: four D66 alderpersons, two VVD alderpersons and two SP alderpersons.</p>\\n<h3>Municipal council 2006-2010</h3>\\n<p>After the 2006 municipal elections a coalition was formed between PvdA and GroenLinks, with a majority of 27 out of 45. These elections saw a political landslide throughout the country, with a strong shift to the left, of which Amsterdam was a prime example. The much talked about all-left-wing coalition of PvdA, GroenLinks and SP that polls indicate would become possible after the national elections of 2006 and that was such a political success in Nijmegen had its largest majority in Amsterdam, apart from some small towns. PvdA even needed only 3 more seats to form a coalition and could thus take its pick, which forced potential coalition partners to give in on a lot of issues. In the case of GroenLinks, this was mostly the policy of preventive searching by the police, which they were opposed to but had to allow.</p>\\n<p>In total, 24 parties took part in the elections, including 11 new ones, but only 7 got seats. Amsterdam Anders/De groenen got assigned one seat at first, but lost it after redistibution, which in the Netherlands is done through a system that favours big parties. In 2002 they only just missed out on a second seat in a similar manner.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Municipal council 2010-2014</h3>\\n<p>Dutch municipal elections, 2010:</p>\\n<p><br></p>\\n\\n<h3>Boroughs</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>Unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into eight boroughs (<i>stadsdelen</i> or 'districts'), a system that was implemented in the 1980s and significantly reformed in 2014. Before 2014, the boroughs were responsible for many activities that previously had been run by the central city. The idea was to bring the government closer to the people. All of these had their own district council (<i>deelraad</i>), chosen by a popular election. Local decisions were made at borough level, and only affairs pertaining the whole city (like major infrastructural projects), were delegated to the central city council. As of 2014, the powers of the boroughs have been significantly reduced, although they still have an elected council called <i>bestuurscommissie</i> ('district committee').</p>\\n<p>The boroughs are:</p>\\n<ul><li>Amsterdam-Centrum (English: <i>Centre</i>).</li>\\n<li>Amsterdam-Noord</li>\\n<li>Amsterdam-Oost</li>\\n<li>Amsterdam-Zuid</li>\\n<li>Amsterdam-West</li>\\n<li>Amsterdam-Zuidoost</li>\\n<li>Amsterdam Nieuw-West</li>\\n</ul><p>The eighth, Westpoort, covers the western harbour area of Amsterdam.

In the beginning, it was just a wooden building with a stone fa\\u00e7ade. In the first years, it was only in use in the winter, but from 1893 on, Dutch theatre producer Frits van Haarlem brought in the summer months vaudeville shows. The shows became very successful, thus changing the circus building to a theatre for all forms of popular entertainment. In 1920, it changed its name to Theatre Carr\\u00e9.</p>\\n<p>In the early 20th century the building was mainly used for vaudeville and revue shows, occasionally Italian operas and operettas. Dutch stars like Lou Bandy and Louis Davids and international celebrities like Josephine Baker and the clown Grock performed here.</p>\\n<p>After the Second World War, revues and winter circuses remained popular. In 1956, Carr\\u00e9 introduced musical theatre to the Netherlands with <i>Porgy and Bess</i>. The one-man show followed in 1963, when Toon Hermans gave his first solo cabaret show. At the end of the 1960s, the theatre was in danger of being demolished. After protests from artists, the municipality of Amsterdam finally refused permission for demolition. In 1977 the municipality bought the building. In 1987, at the centenary, the Royal Predicate was granted and the name was changed to Royal Theatre Carr\\u00e9.

It is bordered by <i>Entrepotdok</i> to the north, <i>Plantage Muidergracht</i> to the east and south, and <i>Nieuwe Herengracht</i> to the west. In the centre of the neighbourhood lies Artis zoo.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The area came within Amsterdam city limits after the completion of the fourth large urban expansion of 1663. Due to an economic crisis caused by the <i>Disaster Year</i>, the city government couldn't find enough buyers for the land. Construction in the area, which was then called <i>Plantagie</i> or <i>Plantaadje</i>, stagnated as a result. Instead, pleasure gardens and orchards were built where Amsterdam's citizens could go and relax in green surroundings.</p>\\n\\n<p>The plots of land in the neighbourhood were leased by the city for a period of 20 years (with the possibility of a 10 year extension). This was because the city council intended to sell the parcels later on; permanent buildings were therefore not allowed. Temporary buildings, however, were tolerated.</p>\\n<p>In 1682, Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam, one of the oldest botanical gardens in the world, opened its doors across from <i>Wertheimpark</i>, currently the only public park in the Centrum district of Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p>The Royal Zoological Society <i>\\\"Natura Artis Magistra\\\"</i> opened Artis Zoo in 1838, making it the oldest zoo in The Netherlands. Of the three main canals of the Canal Belt, <i>Prinsengracht</i> initially extended across <i>Plantage Muidergracht</i> through Plantage towards <i>Entrepotdok</i>. Before it was filled in in 1866, this section of the canal ran through the centre of Artis, dividing it in two. The three ponds within the zoo complex are still reminders of this former part of the canal.</p>\\n<p>After 1860, the area became more urbanized and as such, Plantage was the only residential area within the <i>Singelgracht</i> canal that had large numbers of 19th century buildings. Today, Plantage still has a much greener and more spacious character compared to other neighbourhoods of the old 17th century city limits within the <i>Singelgracht</i>.</p>\\n<h2>Street names</h2>\\n\\n<p>Plantage's main road is called <i>Plantage Middenlaan</i>.

From 1880 to 1935, on the site of the current <i>Plantage Westermanplantsoen</i>, stood the circular <i>Panoramagebouw</i> (Panorama Building). From 1879, summer theatre <i>Frascati</i> stood at the site of the current <i>Studio Desmet</i> (formerly <i>Rika Hoppertheater</i> and <i>Filmtheater Desmet</i>). Between 1892 and 1911, Wertheimpark was the location of the <i>Parktheater</i>. In the Plancius building (1876) on Plantage Kerklaan, <i>Oefening Baart Kunst</i> practised their performing arts. <i>Artis Schouwburg</i>, later called <i>Hollandsche Schouwburg</i>, famously premiered many plays by Herman Heijermans.</p>\\n<p>It was this building that, on 18 July 1942, became a deportation centre from which arrested Jews were deported to extermination camps during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. After the war it became a memorial to the Jewish victims.

It is the oldest zoo in the Netherlands and one of the oldest zoos of mainland Europe. Artis Royal Zoo is not just a zoo, it also contains an aquarium and a planetarium. Artis also has an arboretum and a fairly large art collection. A part of the art collection is on display in the Aquarium building of the zoo. Artis contains 27 monumental buildings, most of which are used as enclosures for the animals, making Artis a unique cultural heritage of the 19th century.</p>\\n<p>The zoo is a member of the Dutch Zoo Federation (NVD), the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), the International Species Information System (ISIS), and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA).</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The zoo was founded in 1838 by Gerard Westerman, J.W.H. Werlemann and J.J. Wijsmuller (also known as the three Ws). It was initially open only to members. Starting in 1851 it was opened to the public during the month of September. In 1920 it was opened year-round to the public, but September remains discount month.</p>\\n<p>The core of the current zoo property, then the \\\"Middenhof\\\" estate, was purchased by the board of the zoological society \\\"Natura Artis Magistra\\\" late in 1838 in the Plantage, which was then a rural area on the outskirts of Amsterdam. From the start it exhibited both live and mounted specimens.</p>\\n<p>The zoo is commonly referred to as Artis, because the zoo has three gates with the words 'Natura', 'Artis', and 'Magistra' written above each of them, respectively. More often than not, only the middle gate was open, so that people who walked through it, seeing that 'Artis' was written above it, believed that the zoo was just called Artis. Thanks to this, soon few people knew it by its full name: Natura Artis Magistra.</p>\\n<p>The last quagga in captivity died at Artis on 12 August 1883. At the time, because all zebras were referred to as quagga, nobody realized that this was the last quagga alive until years later.</p>\\n<h2>Historic buildings</h2>\\n<p>Artis includes 27 historic buildings. The Aquarium was built in 1882 on land leased from the city on condition that only a museum ever be built on it.

Yonderboi&#8217;s music is difficult to pigeonhole because it is quite conceptual and combines a wide range of sources, plays around with various musical styles. Despite of these a certain intense atmosphere and the distinctive melodies remain recognizable in all of his works. Each record was followed by a tour, the first and the second with a live band and the current one as a one-man act. He performed on diverse stages over the years, including festivals such as S&#243;nar, Pukkelpop, Lowlands, Big Chill, Sziget, ADE and venues like Razzmatazz, Melkweg, Paradiso (Amsterdam). Yonderboi's music is often licensed to films, TV and fashion shows or video games. He also enjoys making field trips to different art-forms, he scores movies and theater pieces once in a while and he also composes music for art exhibitions like the Swiss Pavilion of the Venice Biennale 2001. His most notable collaboration was performing an audio-visual show with British film director legend Peter Greenaway during the Berlin Film Festival 2009.

In the 16th century, these precursors of the modern theatre organized themselves into so-called rederijkerskamers, comparable to theater companies. At that time, there were as yet no permanent theater buildings in Amsterdam, and the shipping company cherries performed on temporary stages, from carts (during processions) or in public spaces. In Amsterdam arose the Rederijkerskamers \\\"In Liefde Bloeyende\\\" and \\\"'t Wit Lavendel\\\", with the latter also known as the \\\"Brabantsche Kamer\\\" since its members mainly hailed from Brabant and the Flemish areas.</p>\\n<h2>The (Neder)duytsche Academie (1617-1637)</h2>\\n<p>In 1617, the dramatists Samuel Coster and Bredero - along with their Rederijkerskamer \\\"In Liefde Bloeyende\\\" - founded the Duytsche Academy, an institution after the example of Italian academies, to popularize science through lectures in the national language.

The site is now occupied by a hotel.</p>\\n<h2>The New Theater (1665\\u20131772)</h2>\\n<p>In 1664 it was decided that the small theater of Van Campen had to be replaced by a larger theater building more in tune with the customs and Baroque architecture of the time. This new theater was twice as large as the old, and opened on 26 May 1665. Its first stone had been laid by the youngest daughter of the playwright Jan Vos.</p>\\n<p>The Amsterdam story writer Jan Wagenaar gives an ample description of this building, mentioning in particular the theatre machinery, through which men could fall through the air or disappear below the stage. Gerard de Lairesse helped decorate the interior.</p>\\n\\n<p>This building was regularly extended and adapted but on 7 May 1772, the building caught fire during a performance, after a theatre servant gone had carelessly gone round the building with a naked candle from the stage lighting. The fire quickly burnt itself out, yet killed 18 people, destroyed 22 houses in the surroundings, and was so large that he it could be seen all the way from The Hague, Utrecht and on the island of Texel. The rubble became valuable due to the gold and the jewels in it, and the site was sold by its owners after the fire.</p>\\n<h2>The First Theater on the Leidseplein (1774-1890)</h2>\\n<p>The city theatre moved to the Leidseplein and opened in 1774 or 1790 with a piece by August von Kotzebue. The building had a wooden structure behind a stone facade. It burnt down in 1890.</p>\\n<h2>The present theater on the Leidseplein (1894-today)</h2>\\n<p>The present theatre replaced its burned-down predecessor. It was built between 1892 and 1894 to a design of Jan L. Springer (1850\\u20131915), with the cooperation of his father J. B. Springer and Adolf Leonard van Gendt. The rebuilding was supported closely by prominent banker, philanthropist and senator A.C. Wertheim. In 1982 it became a Rijksmonument.

De Balie specialises in a number of territories: politics, art, society, media and cinema, and regularly organises programs. These programs consistently bear the mark of a sharp and deeply analytical character; De Balie leaves no questions of social relevance unasked. Through talk shows, discussions, debates and theatre, De Balie mixes several points of view in a wayward and creative fashion.</p>\\n<p>De Balie was founded in 1982 and is situated in the previous District Court, built around the end of the nineteenth century, which moved to the Parnassusweg in Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p>Felix Rottenberg is co-founder of De Balie. Anil Ramdas was director from 2003 to 2005. Writer and journalist Yoeri Albrecht has been director from December 1, 2010, to present. He succeeded Ellen Walraven, who is currently working as a dramaturge at Toneelgroep Amsterdam. The current Managing Director is Jolanda Beyer. Next to the direction, the organisation of De Balie contains multiple departments including programming, communications, finances, technicians, building and system management and the Grandcaf\\u00e9.</p>\\n<p>For some programs, De Balie cooperates with a number of set partners. For instance, the programmes in the series <i>Mind the Gap and Justice for All</i> are produced in cooperation with Oxfam Novib, while the Volkskrant, KNAW and Nemo have teamed up for years on the monthly program <i>Kenniscaf\\u00e9</i>, in which journalist-presenter Martijn van Calmthout discusses science in relation to current and controversial topics. Also, De Balie is part of the Cineville partnership and often collaborates with the SLAA.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Programming and archive</h2>\\n<h2>Programming</h2>\\n<p>The most current and up to date agenda is available on the website of De Balie. The programs produced in De Balie are regularly broadcast live on the Internet, under the title De Balie TV. This stream is available on the website of De Balie. This website also hosts an extensive video-archive of controversial programs throughout the years, with guests as Pussy Riot, Marlene Dumas, Seymour Hersh and Tom\\u00e1\\u0161 Sedl\\u00e1cek. Moderators of the programs have included among others: Bahram Sadeghi, Isolde Hallensleben, Pieter Hilhorst and Martijn de Greve.</p>\\n<h2>Archive</h2>\\n<p>Over the years De Balie has created an extensive archive that hosts dossiers, articles and videos of previous programmes and topics. In the past some quite divergent programmes have been shown in De Balie. Some examples:</p>\\n<ul><li>Pussy Riot: an interview with members of Pussy Riot and a screening of the documentary Pussy Riot: A Punk Prayer.</li>\\n<li>Marlene Dumas: a conversation about her work and a screening of Miss Interpreted (Marlene Dumas).</li>\\n<li>And Justice for ALL: a series on the international rule of law, in which diverging topics like the Sharia, censorship in China, justice and injustice have been discussed.</li>\\n<li>Not in my backyard: an international current affairs show of De Balie, which dealt with opics like the situation at the Western Bank, Mexico and the drugs cartels and modern piracy.</li>\\n<li>Kenniscaf\\u00e9: a program that puts science (and scientists) on the spot. Current theme\\u2019s like nuclear energy, obesity, lab-rats and robots have been debated by experts and commentators.</li>\\n<li>India Express: a program that shows India through the eyes of Indian intellectuals and artists.</li>\\n<li>Crash Course Congo: The current, past and future of Congo have been investigated in a series of 6 episodes. Among other things, the focus was on religious soaps, modern art and culture and soap in emergency help-packages.</li>\\n</ul><p>A lot of De Balie programmes are broadcast live on their website.</p>\\n<ul><li>Grandcaf\\u00e9</li>\\n</ul><p>Next to the theatre- and debate centre, the Grandcaf\\u00e9 is also a valuable asset to De Balie. The Grandcaf\\u00e9 offers room for food and drinks, but also for meetings. The caf\\u00e9 is open seven days a week and serves good coffee, lunch, a quick bite to eat, drinks or a full-blown dinner.

Yonderboi&#8217;s music is difficult to pigeonhole because it is quite conceptual and combines a wide range of sources, plays around with various musical styles. Despite of these a certain intense atmosphere and the distinctive melodies remain recognizable in all of his works. Each record was followed by a tour, the first and the second with a live band and the current one as a one-man act. He performed on diverse stages over the years, including festivals such as S&#243;nar, Pukkelpop, Lowlands, Big Chill, Sziget, ADE and venues like Razzmatazz, Melkweg, Paradiso (Amsterdam). Yonderboi's music is often licensed to films, TV and fashion shows or video games. He also enjoys making field trips to different art-forms, he scores movies and theater pieces once in a while and he also composes music for art exhibitions like the Swiss Pavilion of the Venice Biennale 2001. His most notable collaboration was performing an audio-visual show with British film director legend Peter Greenaway during the Berlin Film Festival 2009. Besides his extraordinary musical talent Yonderboi utilizes his visual creativity as well.

It is located on <i>de Weteringschans</i>, bordering the <i>Leidseplein</i>, one of the nightlife and tourism centers of the city. The main concert hall in the former church interior has high ceilings and two balcony rings overlooking the stage area, with three large illuminated church windows above the stage. The acoustics are rather echoey, but improvements have been made over the years. In addition to the main concert hall, there are two smaller cafe stages, on an upper floor and in the basement.</p>\\n<p>Paradiso was squatted by hippies in 1967 who wanted to convert the church to an entertainment and leisure club. The police ended the festivities the same year. In 1968 the city opened Paradiso as a publicly subsidized youth entertainment center. Along with the nearby Melkweg (Milky Way), it soon became synonymous with the hippie counterculture and the rock music of that era. It was one of the first locations in which the use and sale of soft drugs was tolerated. From the mid-1970s, Paradiso became increasingly associated with punk and new wave music, although it continued to program a wide variety of artists. Starting in the late 1980s, raves and themed dance parties became frequent.</p>\\n<p>In recent years, the venue has settled into an eclectic range of programming, which, besides rock, can include lectures, plays, classical music, and crossover artists. Long associated with clouds of tobacco and hashish smoke, Paradiso banned smoking in its public areas (except for a small smoking room) in 2008 in accordance with a nationwide ban on smoking in public venues.</p>\\n<h2>The Acts</h2>\\n\\n<p>Artists who have recorded or filmed concerts at the Paradiso include ADELE, The Rolling Stones, Joy Division, Johnny Thunders, Chic, Joe Jackson, Chris Isaak, Kaizers Orchestra, Duran Duran, Willie Nelson, Phish, Arcade Fire, Nightwish, Bad Brains, Kayak, Loudness, Nirvana, John Cale, The Cure, Soft Machine, Emil\\u00edana Torrini, Jalebee Cartel, Link Wray, Lenny Kravitz, Omar &amp; the Howlers, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Electrosexual, Beth Hart, Dayna Kurtz, Dave Matthews, Smoosh, Suzanne Vega, Amy Winehouse, Milow, Fiction Plane, Epica, Editors, Motorpsycho, Pain of Salvation, Deftones, Riverside, Lamb, Live, NITS, Jamiroquai, Live and The Roots.</p>\\n<p>Glen Matlock played his last gig with The Sex Pistols at the Paradiso.</p>\\n<p>On 26\\u201327 May 1995, The Rolling Stones played two semi-acoustic concerts at the Paradiso. Scalped tickets reportedly sold for many thousands of dollars. Recorded tracks from these concerts were released on the Stones' <i>Stripped</i> album later that year. Keith Richards said that the Paradiso concerts were the best live shows the Stones ever did.</p>\\n<p><br>\\nOther acts who played in Paradiso include Level 42, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, The Fixx, Florence and the Machine, Patrick Wolf, Within Temptation, Adele, Garbage, The Gathering, Nine Inch Nails, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Arctic Monkeys, James Brown, Bo Diddley, The Bangles, Eric Burdon, Bad Religion, Van Halen, Europe, Radiohead, Stereophonics, Prince, UB40, Guns N' Roses, David Bowie, Thirty Seconds to Mars, The Police, Rob Eberhard Young, The Velvet Underground, Rollins Band, Golden Earring, Herman Brood, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Dr. John, Muse, Rory Gallagher, Foo Fighters, Fugazi, Curve, U2, Pearl Jam, Lana Del Rey, Burning Spear, Simple Minds, The Ramones, Cocteau Twins, Human League, Autechre, Orbital, Plaid, The Tragically Hip, Metallica, Faith No More, Faithless, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Ozric Tentacles, Primus, Tool, The Pretty Things, Tracy Chapman, Captain Beefheart, The Jam, Coldplay, Billy Idol, The Killers, Keane, Robbie Williams, Grace Jones, MF Doom, Emil\\u00edana Torrini, Eels, \\\"Weird Al\\\" Yankovic, The Real McKenzies, Patti Smith, Lady Gaga, Ke$ha, Heather Nova, Todd Rundgren, My Morning Jacket, Phish, OFWGKTA, Foals and De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig, Adam Lambert, Goldfrapp, Pentatonix, Camel.</p>\\n<h2>Future</h2>\\n<p>In the 1990s, the future of Paradiso became something of a political issue in Amsterdam, since there was some political resistance to the continuation of the subsidies that allowed the venue to operate in its central city location. More recently, supporters have successfully argued that the Paradiso subsidy is reasonable in comparison with subsidies given to other performance venues.</p>\\n\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\\n<ul><li><i>Converted Churches.</i> Tectum Publishers, Antwerp, Belgium 2007, 178-183.

Promoting the smooth operation of payment systems has both a European and a national dimension. The statistical task is also partly ESCB-related and partly a national concern. These two tasks will not be transferred to ESCB level at the start of EMU. Here the Nederlandsche Bank remains fully in control.

The museum is located at the Museum Square in the borough Amsterdam South, close to the Van Gogh Museum, the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, and the Concertgebouw.</p>\\n<p>The Rijksmuseum was founded in The Hague in 1800 and moved to Amsterdam in 1808, where it was first located in the Royal Palace and later in the Trippenhuis. The current main building was designed by Pierre Cuypers and first opened its doors in 1885. On 13 April 2013, after a ten-year renovation which cost \\u20ac 375 million, the main building was reopened by Queen Beatrix. In 2013, it was the most visited museum in the Netherlands with a record number of 2.2 million visitors.</p>\\n<p>The museum has on display 8,000 objects of art and history, from their total collection of 1 million objects from the years 1200\\u20132000, among which are some masterpieces by Rembrandt, Frans Hals, and Johannes Vermeer. The museum also has a small Asian collection which is on display in the Asian pavilion.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>18th century</h3>\\n\\n<p>In 1795, the Batavian Republic was proclaimed. The Minister of Finance Isaac Gogel argued that a national museum, following the French example of The Louvre, would serve the national interest. On 19 November 1798, the government decided to found the museum.</p>\\n<p>On 31 May 1800, the National Art Gallery (Dutch: <i>Nationale Kunst Gallerij</i>), precursor of the Rijksmuseum, opened its doors in Huis ten Bosch in The Hague. The museum exhibited around 200 paintings and historic objects from the collections of the Dutch stadtholders.</p>\\n<h3>19th century</h3>\\n<p>In 1805, the National Art Gallery moved within The Hague to the Buitenhof.</p>\\n<p>In 1806, the Kingdom of Holland was established by Napoleon Bonaparte. On the orders of king Louis Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon, the museum moved to Amsterdam in 1808. The paintings owned by that city, such as <i>The Night Watch</i> by Rembrandt, became part of the collection. In 1809, the museum opened its doors in the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p>In 1817, the museum moved to the Trippenhuis. The Trippenhuis turned out to be unsuitable as a museum. In 1820, the historical objects were moved to the Mauritshuis in The Hague, and in 1838 the 19th-century paintings were moved to Paviljoen Welgelegen in Haarlem.</p>\\n<p>In 1863, there was a design contest for a new building for the Rijksmuseum, but none of the submissions was considered to be of sufficient quality. Pierre Cuypers also participated in the contest and his submission reached the second place.</p>\\n<p>In 1876 a new contest was held and this time Pierre Cuypers won. The design was a combination of gothic and renaissance elements. The construction began on 1 October 1876. On both the inside and the outside, the building was richly decorated with references to Dutch art history. Another contest was held for these decorations. The winners were B. van Hove and J.F. Vermeylen for the sculptures, G. Sturm for the tile tableaus and painting and W.F. Dixon for the stained glass. The museum was opened at its new location on 13 July 1885.</p>\\n<p>In 1890 a new building was added a short distance to the south-west of the Rijksmuseum. As the building was made out of fragments of demolished buildings, that together give an overview of the history of Dutch architecture, it has come to be known informally as the 'fragment building'. It is also known as the 'south wing', and is currently (in 2013) branded the <i>Philips Wing</i>.</p>\\n<h3>20th century</h3>\\n\\n<p>In 1906 the hall for the <i>Night Watch</i> was rebuilt. In the interior more changes were made, between the 1920s and 1950s most multi-coloured wall decorations were painted over. In the 1960s exposition rooms and several floors were built into the two courtyards. The building had some minor renovations and restorations in 1984, 1995\\u20131996 and 2000.</p>\\n<p>A renovation of the south wing of the museum, also known as the 'fragment building' or 'Philips Wing', was completed in 1996, the same year that the museum held its first major photography exhibition featuring its extensive collection of 19th-century photos.</p>\\n<h3>21st century</h3>\\n\\n<p>In December 2003, the main building of the museum closed for a major renovation. During this renovation, about 400 objects from the collection were on display in the 'fragment building', including Rembrandt's <i>The Night Watch</i> and other 17th-century masterpieces.</p>\\n<p>The restoration and renovation of the Rijksmuseum are based on a design by Spanish architects Antonio Cruz and Antonio Ortiz. Many of the old interior decorations were restored and the floors in the courtyards were removed.

The building also contains a library. The fragment building, branded Philips wing, contains building fragments that show the history of architecture in the Netherlands. The Rijksmuseum is a <i>rijksmonument</i> (national heritage site) since 1970 and was listed in the Top 100 Dutch heritage sites in 1990. The Asian pavilion was designed by Cruz y Ortiz and opened in 2013.</p>\\n<p>According to Muriel Huisman, Project Architect for the Rijksmuseum's renovation, \\\"Cruz y Ortiz always like to look for a synergy between old and new, and we try not to explain things with our architecture.\\u201d With the Rijks, \\u201cthere\\u2019s no cut between old and new; we\\u2019ve tried to merge it.

It is located at the Museum Square in the borough Amsterdam South, where it is close to the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Concertgebouw.</p>\\n<p>The collection comprises modern and contemporary art and design from the early 20th century up to the 21st century. It features artists such as Vincent van Gogh, Wassily Kandinsky, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Jackson Pollock, Karel Appel, Andy Warhol, Willem de Kooning, Marlene Dumas, Lucio Fontana, and Gilbert &amp; George.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>19th century</h3>\\n\\n<p>The Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, opened on 14 September 1895 as an initiative of the local authority and private individuals. The Dutch Neo-Renaissance style museum building was designed by Dutch architect Adriaan Willem Weissman as part of a modernization project spearheaded by local citizens starting in 1850. The construction of the building was largely funded in 1890 by Sophia Adriana de Bruyn. Specifically, it was built under the Vereeniging tot het Vormen van een Verzameling van Hedendaagsche Kunst (VVHK, Society for the formation of a public collection of contemporary art), which was founded in 1874, to house de Bruyn's collection of art and antiques that she donated to the city along with a considerable sum of money. The Van Eeghen family also contributed to the construction costs and donated paintings from the collection of Christiaan Pieter van Eeghen. The building was constructed between 1891 and 1895 at Paulus Potterstraat, a short walking distance from the Rijksmuseum. The museum's original collection included militaria of the Amsterdam militia, Asiatic art, and artifacts from the Museum of Chronometry and the Medical-Pharmaceutical Museum.</p>\\n<h3>20th century</h3>\\n<p>In 1905, Cornelis Baard was appointed curator of the Stedelijk and promoted to museum director in 1920. During his time as curator, the local authority began building its own collection of modern art. The Great Depression in the Netherlands led to municipal cutbacks and an increased need for policy reviews in the first half of the 1930s. In 1932, a purchasing committee was established with two members from the VVHK and two from the local authority. These four figures oversaw all art purchases for the museum, notably works of Hague and Amsterdam Impressionism and pieces by international contemporaries.</p>\\n<p>The museum began actively acquiring art in 1930. In 1933, M.B.B. Nijkerk's collection of books came to the Stedelijk, which was later expanded to include aesthetic book design and typography. The Museum of Applied Art opened on the ground floor of the west wing on 15 December 1934. This collection included furniture, glass, pottery and china, graphic design and posters, textiles, small sculptures and masks, batik, metalwork, and stained glass with an emphasis on Dutch work from around the turn of the century.</p>\\n<p>In 1936, David R\\u00f6ell, who had previously worked at the Rijksmuseum and was secretary of the VVHK, took over as museum director. R\\u00f6ell appointed Willem Sandberg as the new curator in January 1938. Sandberg eventually took over as director of the museum in 1945. By 1962, the VVHK handed over most of its collection, including works by George Hendrik Breitner, Paul C\\u00e9zanne, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet, Vincent van Gogh, and Johan Jongkind.</p>\\n<p>Under the direction of Sandberg, the Stedelijk started a department of applied art in 1945 and a department of prints and drawings in 1954. At the start of 1950, the Stedelijk also began to present modern music and films. The annex known as the Sandberg Wing was built in 1954 to accommodate experimental art. By 1956, a reading room, print room, a museum restaurant and garden, and a new auditorium for film screenings and musical performances was added. Sandberg acquired a group of works by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich in 1958. In the same year, Sandberg began acquiring photography for the museum's collection; the Stedelijk was the first western European museum for modern art to collect photography. The collection includes seminal photographers of both the Dutch and international avant-garde in the interbellum period (such as Erwin Blumenfeld, L\\u00e1szl\\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy and Man Ray), an extensive selection of post-war Dutch photographers (including Eva Besny\\u00f6, Ed van der Elsken and Cas Oorthuys), artist portraits, photojournalism, and autonomous fine art photography from the 1970s onward.</p>\\n<p>During World War II, the Stedelijk collection and that of the Amsterdam Museum were transferred for safekeeping to a bunker in the sand-hills near Santpoort. Museum staff took turns keeping watch. Sandberg only just managed to evade arrest; in 1943, when a German search party was sent to apprehend him, Sandberg fled by bicycle into the dunes. Despite the upheavals of war, the Stedelijk continued to hold exhibitions.</p>\\n<p>Works by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Henri Matisse were added to the collection at the end of the 1940s and 1950s. During this time, the Stedelijk also acquired artworks by De Stijl and related international movements such as Russian Constructivism and Bauhaus.</p>\\n\\n<p>Edy de Wilde, who had run the Van Abbe Museum in Eindhoven, took over as director from 1963 to 1985. He began the first collection of American contemporary art at the Stedelijk. Under his direction, in 1971, debates about the museum's social and educational functions sparked the formation of a communications department. In the early 1970s, the museum made its first acquisitions of video art by European artists including Dibbets and Gilbert &amp; George. Today, the collection of video art contains around 900 works and installations, including works by Nam June Paik, Bill Viola and Bruce Nauman. By the mid-1970s, after the last period rooms were closed, the Stedelijk became exclusively a museum for modern art.</p>\\n<h3>21st century</h3>\\n<p>In 2001, drawings by Kazimir Malevich and other Russian avant-garde artists from the collection of the Khardzhiev-Chaga Cultural Centre were added to the museum's collection of Russian art.</p>\\n\\n<p>At the end of 2003, the Adriaan Willem Weissman building was closed at the insistence of the fire department; renovation work began. The Stedelijk took up temporary residence in the Post CS Building, where it would remain for 4.5 years. In 2005, the museum established a partnership with The Broere Charitable Foundation; on behalf of the Monique Zajfen Collection, the museum acquired contemporary European art works, which were placed at the museum on long-term loan. In 2006, debates and lectures were organized in the context of the exhibition 'Mapping the City', which explored the relationship of artists to the city. A space was created called the 'Docking Station' for monthly presentations of work by emerging artists. In 2008, 'Other voices, other rooms', an exhibition highlighting the video work of Andy Warhol, drew 600,000 visitors.</p>\\n<p>In 2006, the city council privatized the Stedelijk. It became a more businesslike enterprise that leases the museum building from the city and, on behalf of the council, mounts exhibitions and manages, maintains, and adds to the municipal collection.</p>\\n<p>Starting in late 2008, the Stedelijk underwent major construction. In response to this, the museum started the \\\"Stedelijk goes to Town\\\" project to maintain a visual presence within the city of Amsterdam while the building was being renovated. The project ran until the latter half of 2009 and featured a series of workshops, lectures, and presentations in various locations throughout Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p>From August 2010 until January 2011, the Stedelijk Museum opened its doors with a unique program called \\\"The Temporary Stedelijk\\\" in the restored, yet unfinished historical building. After welcoming 'art, artists and the public' back through its doors, the Stedelijk continued with this temporary program. \\\"The Temporary Stedelijk 2\\\" opened in March 2011 and focused on the renowned collection of modern and contemporary art and design. The exhibition showcased the breadth of the museum's collection and exhibited works by Piet Mondrian, Kazimir Malevich, Charley Toorop, Henri Matisse, Donald Judd, Willem de Kooning, Yves Klein and Bruce Nauman, among others. Selections from the collections were presented on a rotating basis. \\\"The Temporary Stedelijk 3\\\" began in October 2011 and featured exhibitions, presentations, and activities located throughout Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p>The museum reopened for the general public on 23 September 2012. In the first month after the reopening, the museum had over 95,000 visitors.</p>\\n<h2>Vandalism and theft</h2>\\n\\n<p>On 21 March 1986, Gerard Jan van Bladeren cut the painting <i>Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue III</i> (1967) by Barnett Newman with a utility knife during a psychotic episode. He was sentenced to eight months in jail and two years probation, and was banned from the museum for three years. On 21 November 1997, Van Bladeren, the same vandal, cut the painting <i>Cathedra</i> (1951), also by Barnett Newman. In court, he pled insanity and was not convicted, but was banned from the museum permanently.</p>\\n<p>On 20 May 1988, the first and only art theft from the Stedelijk took place. The three paintings <i>Vase with Carnations</i> (1886) by Vincent van Gogh, <i>Street in Nevers</i> (1874) by Johan Jongkind, and <i>Still life with bottles and apples</i> by Paul C\\u00e9zanne were stolen during a break in. On 31 May 1988, all three painting were recovered undamaged by police pretending to be buyers. The thief was arrested and convicted.</p>\\n<p>On 15 May 2011, AFC Ajax's victory in the national competition was celebrated at the Museum Square. During the celebration, supporters damaged the Benthem Crouwel Wing's rooftop and glass panels, resulting in \\u20ac400,000 of damage and prompting a change in venue to the Amsterdam Arena for the celebration of AFC Ajax's subsequent 2012 victory. Despite these issues, the city government of Amsterdam has stated that it will still consider using the Museum Square as a potential location for large events.</p>\\n<h2>Collection</h2>\\n\\n<p>The museum collection holds almost 90,000 objects, collected since 1874. With important clusters and cores focusing on De Stijl, Bauhaus, Pop Art and CoBrA and, more recently, Neo-Impressionism, the collection represents virtually every significant movement in art and design of the 20th and 21st centuries. The Stedelijk also has a comprehensive collection of drawings and paintings by Kazimir Malevich. Key pieces by Post-Impressionists Paul C\\u00e9zanne and Vincent van Gogh exemplify art from the late 19th century. The collection is sub-divided into the following disciplines:</p>\\n<ul><li>Painting</li>\\n<li>Sculpture</li>\\n<li>Installation</li>\\n<li>Moving image and sound</li>\\n<li>Prints and drawings</li>\\n<li>Posters</li>\\n<li>Photography</li>\\n<li>Graphic design</li>\\n<li>Industrial design</li>\\n<li>Artist books</li>\\n<li>Lucebert archive</li>\\n</ul><p>In early 2010, the Stedelijk Museum partnered up with design agency Fabrique and augmented reality firm Layar to develop virtual art tours called \\\"ARtours\\\". Using smartphone technology, visitors are treated to additional stories and images about the collection both inside the museum and outside around the city. In the final phase of this project at the end of 2011, the public was invited to add their own stories, images, and other information through the open source platform.</p>\\n<h3>Digitization</h3>\\n<p>In November 2009, the museum started a project to digitize the historical archive, which spans from 1895 to 1980. The archive contains around 1.5 million documents in around 7,000 folders, and includes correspondence letters of the director and buyer records. Ownership of the documents has been officially transferred to the Amsterdam City Archive, but the documents will remain in the Stedelijk Museum until the digitization project is completed.</p>\\n<h2>Weissman Building</h2>\\n\\n<p>Dutch architect Adriaan Willem Weissman designed the building for the Stedelijk in 1895. The design of the upper fa\\u00e7ade and tower in a combination of pale stone and red brick give the exterior of the building a 16th-century Dutch Neo-Renaissance look. In 1938, director Willem Sandberg had the interior walls painted white, creating 'white cube' gallery spaces. Some years later, in 1954, Sandberg had the opportunity to build a largely glass extension flanking the Van Baerlestraat, which came to be referred to as the \\\"Sandberg Wing\\\". Sandberg also replaced the museum's heavy, rather uninviting doors with a glass entrance. In 1934, Baard turned the loggia above the museum's main entrance into an exhibition space and had several galleries repainted in light colors. When R\\u00f6ell took over in 1936, he installed light wall coverings inside some of the galleries and had new doorways put in on the upper-floor galleries. Then, in 1938, R\\u00f6ell had the polychrome staircase whitewashed and replaced the yellow glass in the skylight with lime-washed glass.</p>\\n<p>Due to poor maintenance and lack of modern facilities, including climate control, the building was deemed unable to meet modern standards. Additionally, it did not have the space to feature the highlights of the collection on permanent display. Since its beginnings, over a century ago, the collection had vastly increased. The art depots and workshops had also become far too cramped. In 1993, a leak in the roof of the museum damaged several large paintings, among them pieces by Ellsworth Kelly and Julian Schnabel. A competition to renovate the museum was first held in the early 1990s, with Robert Venturi beating Rem Koolhaas, Wim Quist, and Carel Weeber to the job. Venturi was replaced by \\u00c1lvaro Siza Vieira in 1996.</p>\\n<h2>Relocation and addition</h2>\\n<p>The old building was forced to close in January 2004 when it no longer complied with fire regulations. The Stedelijk was temporarily relocated to the Post-CS building, an old building of the Postal Service close to the Amsterdam Central Station. When the Post-CS location was closed in 2008, a book called \\\"Stedelijk Museum CS \\u2013 Prospect/Retrospect\\\" was published to commemorate some of the successful expositions and artists during this period, like Andy Warhol and Rineke Dijkstra.</p>\\n<h3>Benthem Crouwel Wing</h3>\\n\\n<p>After further discussions about whether to relocate the contemporary art museum to an Amsterdam park, a new jury eventually awarded Benthem Crouwel Architects the renovation and construction contract for their design for the new building, referred to as \\\"The Bathtub\\\". The new Stedelijk has an exhibition surface area of 8,000 square meters, which is double its previous gallery space. Michael Kimmelman, architecture critic for <i>The New York Times</i>, wrote of the museum's addition, \\\"I can't recall seeing a more ridiculous looking building than the new Stedelijk Museum.\\\" The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> called the extension \\\"oversized, antiseptic and mismatched\\\".</p>\\n<p>When Alvaro Siza had originally designed the plans, the reopening was scheduled for 2007. In 2004, when a new competition was held, it became clear that this date was not achievable. Although the renovated original building was completed in early 2010, conditions were not suitable for exhibiting artworks because there was no climate control system, which was to be installed in the new wing. The press poured criticism on the delays. A campaign by Dutch cultural entrepreneur Otto Nan, \\\"Stedelijk Do Something\\\", urged people to text their disappointment about the delays. This drew considerable media attention and a huge response from social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook. Nan hoped that what he referred to as an \\\"amicable coup\\\" would attract political attention with an occupation of Museum Square. By sending SMS messages, people could raise money to help the museum re-launch a little sooner. With even more delays in 2011 when contractor Midreth went bankrupt, the plan to re-open in the spring of 2010 was moved to 2012. The restored original building went ahead and opened with a temporary exposition in 2010, which attracted about 223,000 visitors.</p>\\n\\n<p>Contractor VolkerWessels finished the construction in February 2012, after which the climate control system was set up. After eight years of work, the new Stedelijk opened on 23 September 2012. With the renovation and expansion, the highlights of the collection are on display in the old building in a series of changing presentations. The new wing consists of a large glassed entrance, which opens onto the Museum Square, and galleries for temporary exhibitions on the upper level and in the basement. It also houses the museum shop, restaurant and library, as well as an auditorium. The inaugural exhibition, entitled \\u201cBeyond Imagination\\u201d, was a show of work by emerging Amsterdam artists. A retrospective of the late Los Angeles artist Mike Kelley followed in December 2012.</p>\\n<p>The completion of the project cost a total of \\u20ac127m, \\u20ac20m more than estimated in 2007, which was mostly funded by Amsterdam's city council.</p>\\n<h2>Visual identity</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1963, Wim Crouwel and his design company, Total Design, began working for the Stedelijk Museum under the new director Eduard de Wilde. Crouwel designed catalogues, invitations, posters, and brochures using a consistent grid. He wanted to standardize the typography using the Univers typeface since it has the same x height on every weight. This grid-like layout became known as the SM-design style.</p>\\n<p>Armand Mevis and Linda van Deursen redesigned the logo and visual identity of the museum in 2012, which was gradually unveiled with its re-opening on 23 September 2012. Mevis and van Deursen had previously designed the graphic identity of the temporary Stedelijk program from 2010 to 2012. The main aspect of the new logo is a large sans-serif S that is composed of the letters of the museum's name in capital letters. The typeface used is Union, a hybrid of Helvetica and Arial, created by typographer Radim Pe\\u00f6ko in 2009. Union is used for all of the museum's interior and exterior signage and additional materials and resources.

Westergasfabriek was ready in 1885 and was strategically situated between the Haarlemmer trekvaart, and the first railway line in the Netherlands. In 1885 it was the largest gas extraction plant in the Netherlands. The gas was extracted from coal and was used for street lighting. Because of the higher gas prices the City of Amsterdam took over the operation in 1898 and expanded the plant. The plant was perfectly situated between the water and the railway line but gas production was very successful. The big Gasholder was built in 1902. The gas factory produced gas for the city utill the late fifties. Amsterdam went over to gas from Hoogovens in IJmuiden, so the production of coal gas from the Factory decreased. In the sixties natural gas was found in Slochteren in the North of the Netherlands. This is why in 1967 the production of gas from the Factory stopped permanently.</p>\\n<p>After the Western Gas Factory closed the Amsterdam Electricity and Gas Company (GEB) destroyed some of the buildings among them the gas plant itself and the water tower. The other buildings were used for storage and repair and as laboratories and workshops. The remaining buildings were recognised as monuments in 1989. In 1992 the GEB left the buildings and they were taken over by the District Council of Westerpark.</p>\\n<h2>Redevelopment</h2>\\n<p>Most of the thirteen buildings on site were designed by architect Isaac Gosschalk in the Dutch Neo Renaissance style, popular in the Netherlands between 1870 and 1915. Gosschalk was a famous architect in his time, as famous as [Cuypers] and [Van Gendt]. He was a Jewish architect and he mainly built factories among them the [Heineken] brewery which is unfortunately completely destroyed and the railway station of [Groningen]. Gosschalk united the functional nature of the buildings with the beauty of architecture. Symmetry played an important role in his design. Thirteen of the original buildings remain on the site (not all by Gosschalk) and are designated as national monuments. In the eighties the City of Amsterdam started to think about redevelopment but found out that the site was heavily polluted. In the nineties the District Council of Westerpark took over the responsibilities for the redevelopment. There were four main problems: remediation of the pollution, constructing a new park, finding new use for the derelict buildings and the overall problem: a lack of money.</p>\\n<h2>Culture Park</h2>\\n<p>The gas works were re-opened as the \\\"Culture Park Westergasfabriek\\\" in 2003. Its television studios host programmes like \\\"Pauw en Witteman\\\" (a late night talkshow), \\\"De wereld draait door\\\" (an early evening talk show with Matthijs van Nieuwkerk) and Eva Jinek's Sunday morning talk show. Six times per year there can be huge concerts organized on the main event field. Thousands of people visit the park and its activities every day.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n<ol class=\\\"references\\\"><li id=\\\"cite_note-1\\\"><b>^</b> Westergasfabriek</li>\\n<li id=\\\"cite_note-hist-2\\\">^ <sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup> <sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup> \\\"History\\\".

The Dutch term \\\"concertgebouw\\\" literally translates into English as \\\"concert building\\\". On 11 April 2013, on occasion of the building's 125th anniversary, Queen Beatrix bestowed the Royal Title \\\"Koninklijk\\\" upon the building, as she did previously on to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Because of its highly regarded acoustics, the Concertgebouw is considered one of the finest concert halls in the world, along with places such as Boston's Symphony Hall and the Musikverein in Vienna.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The architect of the building was Adolf Leonard van Gendt, who was inspired by the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, built two years earlier (and destroyed in 1943).</p>\\n<p>Construction began in 1883 in a pasture that was then outside the city, in Nieuwer-Amstel, a municipality that in 1964 became Amstelveen. 2,186 piles twelve to thirteen metres (40 to 43\\u00a0ft) in length were sunk into the soil.</p>\\n<p>The hall opened on 11 April 1888 with an inaugural concert, in which an orchestra of 120 musicians and a chorus of 500 singers participated, performing works of Wagner, Handel, Bach, and Beethoven. The resident orchestra of the Concertgebouw is the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (<i>Koninklijk Concertgebouworkest</i>), which gave its first concert in the hall on 3 November 1888, as the Concertgebouw Orchestra (<i>Concertgebouworkest</i>).</p>\\n<p>The Main Hall (<i>Grote Zaal</i>) seats 1,974, and is 44 metres (144\\u00a0ft) long, 28 metres (92\\u00a0ft) wide, and 17 metres (56\\u00a0ft) high. Its reverberation time is 2.8 seconds without audience, 2.2 seconds with, making it ideal for the late Romantic repertoire such as Mahler. Though this characteristic makes it largely unsuited for amplified music, groups such as Led Zeppelin, The Who and Pink Floyd performed there in the 1960s. It hosts not only orchestral and operatic performances, but also jazz and world music.</p>\\n<p>A smaller, oval-shaped venue, the Recital Hall (<i>Kleine Zaal</i>), is located behind the Main Hall. The Recital Hall is 20 metres (66\\u00a0ft) long and 15 metres (50\\u00a0ft) wide. Its more intimate space is well-suited for chamber music and Lieder. The Recital Hall has 437 seats.</p>\\n<p>When the Concertgebouw was built, acoustics were something of a <i>black art</i>. As in shipbuilding, designers drew upon what had worked in the past without entirely understanding the underlying science. When the building was completed, the acoustics were not perfect, and a lot of effort went into fine-tuning the aural ambience. During later restorations, particular care has been taken not to alter the materials used for interior decoration with this in mind. In the 1980s, the hall embarked on extensive fund-raising for renovations after the hall was found to be slowly sinking into the ground. Pi de Bruijn was the architect for the contemporary annex to the original hall.</p>\\n<p>Today, some nine hundred concerts and other events per year take place in the Concertgebouw, for a public of over 700,000, making it one of the most-visited concert halls in the world.</p>\\n<p>The current managing director of the Concertgebouw is Simon Reinink. The hall's current artistic director is Anneke Hogenstijn.</p>\\n<h2>Organ</h2>\\n\\n<p>The organ was built in 1890 by the organ builder Michael Maarschalkerweerd from Utrecht, and was renovated in the years 1990-1993 by the organ builder Flentrop. It has 60 registers on three divisions and pedal.</p>\\n<ul><li>Couplers: II/I (also as Suboktavkoppel), III/I, III/II, I/P, II/P, III/P</li>\\n</ul><h2>Names of composers in the Main Hall</h2>\\n<p>In the Main Hall, the surnames of the following 46 composers are displayed on the balcony ledges and on the walls:</p>\\n<h2>In popular culture</h2>\\n<p>The Concertgebouw is mentioned, along with Madison Square Garden and the Hollywood Bowl, in the song \\\"Rock Show\\\" from the 1975 Wings album <i>Venus and Mars</i>.</p>\\n<h2>Gallery</h2>\\n<ul class=\\\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\\\"><li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n</ul><h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra</li>\\n<li>History of Amsterdam</li>\\n<li>List of concert halls</li>\\n<li>List of tourist attractions in Amsterdam</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n<ol class=\\\"references\\\"><li id=\\\"cite_note-Concert_halls-1\\\">^ <sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup> <sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup> <sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup> \\\"Concert halls\\\".

It is part of the borough of Amsterdam-Zuid and situated west from the Leidseplein and the Museumplein. The park was opened in 1865 and originally named the \\\"Nieuwe Park\\\", but later renamed to \\\"Vondelpark\\\", after the 17th century author Joost van den Vondel. Yearly, the park has around 10 million visitors. In the park is an open air theatre, a playground and several <i>horeca</i> facilities.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>19th century</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>In 1864 a group of citizens led by Christiaan Pieter van Eeghen established the <i>Vereeniging tot Aanleg van een Rij- en Wandelpark</i> (English: Association for the Construction of a Park for Riding and Strolling). They bought several hectares of grass-land and marshes at the rim of the city of Amsterdam, in order to create the new park. They assigned the architect Jan David Zocher to design it, and in 1865 \\\"Het Nieuwe Park\\\" (English: \\\"The New Park\\\") was opened for members of the association and in exchange for a fee also for other citizens.</p>\\n<p>Two years after the park opened, in 1867, a statue of writer and playwright Joost van den Vondel was placed in the park. Sculptor Louis Royer created the sculpture and the architect Pierre Cuypers designed the stand. As a result people started to call the park \\\"Vondelspark\\\" (English: \\\"Vondel's Park\\\").</p>\\n<p>In 1873 a bandstand was built. In the same year, brewer Gerard Adriaan Heineken was denied to open a bar in the park, so he built the <i>Bierhuis Vondel</i> (English: \\\"Beer House Vondel\\\") in the street next to the park, what is now Vondelstraat 41.</p>\\n<p>The last part of the park was designed by Louis Paul Zocher, Jan David Zocher's son, and was realized from 1875 to 1877. The park now became its current size of 47 hectares. Also the English garden style design of the Zochers has been roughly maintained up to now, although in the late 19th century the elongated park had a stream of water from the beginning to the end and contained many small paths and small bushes.</p>\\n<p>In 1878 the <i>Pavillon</i> (English: \\\"Pavilion\\\") was built as a replacement of a wooden chalet built by Louis Paul Zocher. The <i>Pavillon</i> is currently known as the <i>Vondelparkpaviljoen</i> (English: \\\"Vondelpark Pavilion\\\"). The park's name was officially changed into \\\"Vondelpark\\\" (English: \\\"Vondel Park\\\") in 1880.</p>\\n<p>Already in the 1880s and 1890s the cycling in the park caused hindrance. First the park management tried to resolve this with restrictive measurements against cyclists, such as special bike paths, limited opening hours, and fines for cyclists that were going faster than a horse's trot. It was only after mediation of the <i>Algemene Nederlandsche Wielrijders-Bond</i> (English: \\\"General Dutch Cyclists Union\\\"), that helped fund the park, that a park guard was installed and cyclists were again permitted to cycle normally.</p>\\n<h3>20th century</h3>\\n\\n<p>In 1936, a rose garden was created in the center of the park.</p>\\n<p>One year later in 1937, the <i>Blauwe Theehuis</i> (English: \\\"Blue Tearoom\\\") was opened. This tearoom is a round modernist building, designed by the architectural office Baanders.</p>\\n<p>In the following years the overall maintenance of the park became too expensive for the <i>Vereniging tot aanleg van een rij- en wandelpark</i> (English: \\\"Association for the creation of a park for riding and strolling\\\"), due to an intensified use, and in 1953 the association donated the park to the city of Amsterdam. The landscape architect Egbert Mos renovated the Vondelpark for the city in the 1950s. The purpose was improve the park for both usage and maintenance. Small bushes were grouped into larger bushes, superfluous paths were removed, and the rose garden was renovated. Also the stream of water in the \\\"trunk\\\" near the northern entrance of the park was removed.</p>\\n<p>In the 1960s children's playgrounds were created. During the flower power era in the 1960s/1970s the Vondelpark became a symbol of a place where \\\"everything is possible and (almost) everything is allowed\\\". In the 1980s an open air theatre was built.</p>\\n<p>The Vondelpark received the status of <i>rijksmonument</i> (English: \\\"state monument\\\") in 1996.</p>\\n<h3>21st century</h3>\\n\\n<p>In the 1990s the number of visitors grew to approximately 10 million visitors annually. The grass is used as sports field and the paths as bike paths. This caused the city to start a new renovation that takes place from 1999 to 2010. The purpose is to intensify the monumental value of the park and furthermore to improve the park's durability. The renovation takes more than ten years in order to decrease the hindrance for visitors and for brooding animals.</p>\\n<p>Starting in September 2008, adults were planned to be legally allowed to have sex in the park, as long as they \\\"take their garbage with them afterwards and never have intercourse near the playground. The sex must be limited to the evening hours and night.\\\", in the words of current Amsterdam Alderman Paul Van Grieken. However, Amsterdam Police announced that they would not in fact tolerate this as the law required them to prevent it.</p>\\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\\n<h3>Open air theatre</h3>\\n\\n<p>The Vondelpark Openluchttheater is an open air theatre with shows from June until August. There are performances of classical music, pop music, world music, dance, musical theatre, and cabaret. The theatre receives a subsidy from the city government.

It consists of the four largest Dutch cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht), and the surrounding areas. With a population of 7,100,000 it is one of the largest conurbations in Europe,<sup class=\\\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\\\">[b]</sup> comparable in size to Milan or the San Francisco Bay Area and covers an area of approximately 8,287\\u00a0km\\u00b2.<sup class=\\\"reference plainlinks nourlexpansion\\\" id=\\\"ref_area\\\">[a]</sup></p>\\n<p>It contains the largest European seaport in Rotterdam and one of the largest European airports near Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p>The Randstad's main cities are Almere, Amersfoort, Amsterdam, Delft, Dordrecht, Gouda, Haarlem, Leiden, Rotterdam, The Hague (Den Haag in Dutch), Utrecht, and Zoetermeer. Other centres include Alphen aan den Rijn, Amstelveen, Barendrecht, Capelle aan den IJssel, Hilversum, Hoofddorp, Hoek van Holland, Houten, Katwijk, Leidschendam, Maassluis, Nieuwegein, Oostzaan, Purmerend, Rijswijk, Schiedam, Spijkenisse, Vlaardingen, Voorburg, Zeist and Zaanstad.</p>\\n<p>The name Randstad means edge or border city. It is an industrial and metropolitan conurbation occupying an area of peat and clay lowlands in west-central Netherlands. Randstad consists of major Dutch industrial cities extending in a crescent (open to the south-east) from Utrecht in the east to Dordrecht in the south and to Lelystad in the north. Randstad is one of the most important economic and densely populated areas in the northwest of Europe. The regions form a ring of four large urban agglomerations (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht), as well as a number of medium-sized and smaller towns, such Almere, Delft, Leiden and Haarlem. These closely linked agglomerations are situated around the green heart of Holland; a green area, which provides the region not only healthy fresh air but also, room for agricultural activity and for rest and recreation. This combination of space for business activity, residential areas and recreation makes Randstad Region an attractive region both in which to live and to locate businesses.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Controversy</h2>\\n\\n<p>Over the last few decades, a major topic in the Randstad is the conflict between the cities and the towns in between. These towns and the surrounding countryside, known as the <i>Groene Hart</i> (<i>Green Heart</i>), are usually much greener than the cities, they house many commuters that work in the cities and the former strongly depend on the latter for facilities such as hospitals and large scale entertainment. Cities need more space to expand, yet the towns fear losing their identity and autonomy.</p>\\n<p>An issue regarding the Randstad is the question of its borders. The Randstad's borders have never been officially specified. Some consider only the four biggest cities of the Netherlands (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht) part of it, others would say that areas such as Alkmaar (which is representing itself as being part of it), Hoorn and Lelystad are also part of this conurbation. The publication \\\"Randstad 2040\\\", released by the Dutch government, reveals that the Noordvleugel (<i>North Wing</i>, Amsterdam and Utrecht region) is already growing parallel to the A1, A2, and A4 motorways, as well as into the northern part of North Holland (Alkmaar region) and Flevoland (Lelystad region). There is also a trend shown that the Noordvleugel are expanding parallel to the A2 (Amsterdam towards Eindhoven) and A12 (Utrecht towards the WERV (Wageningen-Ede-Rhenen-Veenendaal)) motorways. This region is called the 'Zuidoostflank' (Southeastside).</p>\\n\\n<h2>Culture</h2>\\n\\n<p>The Randstad has a history of competition. For instance, Rotterdam and Amsterdam, the two main cities, compete in many ways, from football to art. Lately, the cultural sector has tried to limit this rivalry and look for mutual strength. Major cultural organisations in Amsterdam, such as the Concertgebouw and Holland Festival, have joined forces with similar organisations in Rotterdam via A'R'dam. In 2007, these organisations published a manifesto with plans for co-operation. One of the goals is to strengthen the international position of culture and art in the Netherlands in the international context.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n\\n<p>Recently, Dutch planners have started to refer to the Randstad as <i>Deltametropool</i>. Deltametropolis actually consists of two large metropolitan areas:</p>\\n<p>1. The <b>Noordvleugel</b> (<i>North Wing</i>, with a population of around 3.6 million people), consisting of the Haarlem and IJmuiden conurbations in the west, Amsterdam at the centre and Almere and the Gooi area in the east. The conurbation of Utrecht (pop. around an extra 1 million) could also be considered to be part of this wing. Its cultural centre, however, is notably centered around Amsterdam, which could \\u2013 as such \\u2013 be considered a classical centralistic metropole. Amsterdam recently started to present itself as the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (<i>Metropoolregio Amsterdam</i>). The expectation is that the use of the Noordvleugel and the Randstad will become less as a result. This part of the Randstad is expected to grow more in population than the Zuidvleugel and the Groene Hart/Green Heart areas, with the growth of population also being in effect for a longer period of time, compared to the other two areas.</p>\\n<p>2. The <b>Zuidvleugel</b> (<i>South Wing</i>, with a population of around 3.5 million people), stretching some 60 kilometers from Dordrecht in the South East to Leiden in the North. The main conurbations are the Rotterdam and The Hague areas. The virtual centre of the Zuidvleugel lies in between these two major cities, near Delft. The first steps toward this development are currently being taken with the construction of a new fast light-rail connection between Rotterdam and The Hague: RandstadRail. A long delayed extension of the western A4-motorway from the south of Delft to Rotterdam has also been put back on the administrative agenda, creating a second connection between Rotterdam, via The Hague, to Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p>A possible new area would be the Zuidoostflank; parallel to the A2 motorway (from Amsterdam to Eindhoven) and parallel to the A12 motorway (Utrecht to WERV (Wageningen, Ede, Rhenen and Veenendaal)), as this region has much potential to strengthen the knowledge economy of the Randstad.</p>\\n<h2>Knowledge and Innovation Community</h2>\\n<p>Randstad is one of co-location centres of Knowledge and Innovation Community (Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation) of The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT).</p>\\n<p>The Governing Board of the <i>European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT)</i> met on 16 December in Budapest to designate the first three Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs).</p>\\n<ul><li>Sustainable energy \\u2013 co-location centres: Karlsruhe, Krakow, Grenoble, Eindhoven / Leuven, Barcelona, Stockholm.</li>\\n<li>Climate change mitigation and adaptation \\u2013 co-location centres: London, Z\\u00fcrich, Berlin metropolitan area, Paris metropolitan area, Randstad metropolitan area.</li>\\n<li>Future information and communication society \\u2013 co-location centres: Berlin, Eindhoven, Helsinki, Paris and Stockholm.</li>\\n</ul><h2>Transport</h2>\\n\\n<p>The Randstad possesses a large infrastructure system, with many railways, motorways, trams and subways in various cities. It is possible to cycle on reasonably safe and pleasant routes almost everywhere and cycling is a major mode of transport. The port of Rotterdam, and Schiphol airport, are both major international gateways. There are various smaller ports and airports in the Randstad, like the ports of IJmuiden, Amsterdam and Dordrecht, as well as Rotterdam-The Hague Airport.</p>\\n<h3>Motorways</h3>\\n<p>The Randstad has various motorways, most of them starting around Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Many international corridors start in the Randstad, including the A1, A2, A4, A7, A12, A15, A16 and A20 motorways, as well as various commuter routes.</p>\\n<p>The Randstad network of motorways carry some of the highest traffic volumes in Europe. Until about 10 years ago most motorways used to be no wider than 2x2 or 2x3 lanes, but in recent years capacity of most major highways has been expanded to six or eight and on some parts even ten lanes. A 14-lane highway is projected near Utrecht. Some hard shoulders are in use as peak hour lanes \\u2013 traffic is allowed to use the hard shoulder as a third or fourth lane during periods of congestion, when traffic management signs indicate. Since these expansions traffic jams (which used to be quite intense) have been reduced by up to 25%. Traffic on the highway still is quite heavy, though.</p>\\n<p>Because of the many obstructions in minor roads, such as one-way or circular routes (often created to make living neighbourhoods safer), a lot of local traffic also uses the motorways. There are a few missing links in the motorway network of the Randstad, especially on the A4 motorway, where construction has been a topic of debate since the 1960s. This results in quite heavy traffic on the alternative A13 highway between Rotterdam and the Hague.</p>\\n<p>Another growing issue is the number of trucks on the radiating motorways from the Randstad; truck volumes can be as high as 20,000 trucks per day, occupying the entire right lane on some motorways.</p>\\n<h3>Railways</h3>\\n<p>The Randstad is the keystone of the Dutch railway network; most intercity connections terminate in one of the key cities in the Randstad. The railway network in the area is dense and heavily used. Delays used to be common. Together with the Swiss Federal Railways (#1), and the Belgian railways (#3), the Dutch Railways is in the top 3 of Europe. Larger cities in the Randstad have many railway stations, as well as light rail, subway and/or tram networks.</p>\\n<h3>Cycling</h3>\\n<p>Much effort is being expended in increasing the cycling rate of the Randstad. The campaign Fietsfilevrij exists to encourage cycling as an alternative to waiting in traffic jams on the motorway. Bicycle superhighways have been built on which cyclists have priority for long distance, high speed cycle commuting. For instance, one of these stretches the 50\\u00a0km distance between Amsterdam and Utrecht.</p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>List of metropolitan areas in the European Union by GDP</li>\\n<li>BrabantStad</li>\\n<li>Blue Banana</li>\\n<li>Global city</li>\\n<li>Urban agglomeration</li>\\n</ul><h2>Notes</h2>\\n<dl><dd>\\n<ol><li><b>^</b> Randstad is not an official statistical area.

It is located in the eastern corner of the Randstad conurbation, and is the fourth largest city in the Netherlands with a population of 330,772 in 2014.</p>\\n<p>Utrecht's ancient city centre features many buildings and structures several dating as far back as the Early Middle Ages. It has been the religious centre of the Netherlands since the 8th century. Currently it is the see of the Archbishop of Utrecht, the most important Dutch Roman Catholic leader. Utrecht is also the see of the archbishop of the Old Catholic church, titular head of the Union of Utrecht, and the location of the offices of the main Protestant church. Utrecht was the most important city in the Netherlands until the Dutch Golden Age, when it was succeeded by Amsterdam as the country's cultural centre and most populous city.</p>\\n<p>Utrecht is host to Utrecht University, the largest university in the Netherlands, as well as several other institutes for higher education. Due to its central position within the country, it is an important transport hub for both rail and road transport. It has the second highest number of cultural events in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>Origins (until 650)</h3>\\n\\n<p>Although there is some evidence of earlier inhabitation in the region of Utrecht, dating back to the Stone Age (app. 2200 BCE) and settling in the Bronze Age (app. 1800\\u2013800\\u00a0BCE), the founding date of the city is usually related to the construction of a Roman fortification (<i>castellum</i>), probably built in around 50 CE. A series of such fortresses was built after the Roman emperor Claudius decided the empire should not expand north. To consolidate the border the limes Germanicus defense line was constructed. along the main branch of the river Rhine, which at that time flowed through a more northern bed compared to today (what is now the Kromme Rijn). These fortresses were designed to house a cohort of about 500 Roman soldiers. Near the fort settlements would grow housing artisans, traders and soldiers' wives and children.</p>\\n<p>In Roman times, the name of the Utrecht fortress was simply <i>Traiectum</i>, denoting its location at a possible Rhine crossing. Traiectum became Dutch Trecht; with the U from Old Dutch \\\"uut\\\" (downriver) added to distinguish U-trecht from Maas-tricht. In 11th-century official documents it was Latinized as Ultra Traiectum. Around the year 200, the wooden walls of the fortification were replaced by sturdier tuff stone walls, remnants of which are still to be found below the buildings around Dom Square.</p>\\n<p>From the middle of the 3rd century Germanic tribes regularly invaded the Roman territories. Around 275 the Romans could no longer maintain the northern border and Utrecht was abandoned. Little is known about the next period 270\\u2013650. Utrecht is first spoken of again several centuries after the Romans left. Under the influence of the growing realms of the Franks, during Dagobert I's reign in the 7th century, a church was built within the walls of the Roman fortress. In ongoing border conflicts with the Frisians this first church was destroyed.</p>\\n<h3>Centre of Christianity in the Netherlands (650\\u20131579)</h3>\\n\\n<p>By the mid-7th century, English and Irish missionaries set out to convert the Frisians. The pope appointed their leader, Willibrordus, bishop of the Frisians. The tnure of Willibrordus is generally considered to be the beginning of the Bishopric of Utrecht. In 723, the Frankish leader Charles Martel bestowed the fortress in Utrecht and the surrounding lands as the base of the bishops. From then on Utrecht became one of the most influential seats of power for the Roman Catholic Church in the Netherlands. The archbishops of Utrecht were based at the uneasy northern border of the Carolingian Empire. In addition, the city of Utrecht had competition from the nearby trading centre Dorestad. After the fall of Dorestad around 850, Utrecht became one of the most important cities in the Netherlands. The importance of Utrecht as a centre of Christianity is illustrated by the election of the Utrecht-born Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens as pope in 1522 (the last non-Italian pope before John Paul II).</p>\\n<h4>Prince-bishops</h4>\\n\\n<p>When the Frankish rulers established the system of feudalism, the Bishops of Utrecht came to exercise worldly power as prince-bishops. The territory of the bishopric not only included the modern province of Utrecht (Nedersticht, 'lower Sticht'), but also extended to the northeast. The feudal conflict of the Middle Ages heavily affected Utrecht. The prince-bishopric was involved in almost continuous conflicts with the Counts of Holland and the Dukes of Guelders. The Veluwe region was seized by Guelders, but large areas in the modern province of Overijssel remained as the Oversticht.</p>\\n<h4>Clerical buildings</h4>\\n<p>Several churches and monasteries were built inside, or close to, the city of Utrecht. The most dominant of these was the Cathedral of Saint Martin, inside the old Roman fortress. The construction of the present Gothic building was begun in 1254 after an earlier romanesque construction had been badly damaged by fire. The choir and transept were finished from 1320 and were followed then by the ambitious Dom tower. The last part to be constructed was the central nave, from 1420. By that time, however, the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished, the construction of the central nave being suspended before the planned flying buttresses could be finished. Besides the cathedral there were four collegiate churches in Utrecht: St. Salvator's Church (demolished in the 16th century), on the Dom square, dating back to the early 8th century. Saint John (Janskerk), originating in 1040; Saint Peter, building started in 1039 and Saint Mary's church building started around 1090 (demolished in the early 19th century, cloister survives). Besides these churches the city housed Saint Paul's Abbey. The 15th-century beguine monastery of Saint Nicholas, and a 14th-century chapter house of the Teutonic Knights.</p>\\n<p>Besides these buildings which belonged to the bishopric; an additional four parish churches were constructed in the city: the Jacobikerk (dedicated to Saint James), founded in the 11th century, with the current Gothic church dating back to the 14th century; the Buurkerk (Neighbourhood-church) of the 11th-century parish in the centre of the city; Nicolaichurch (dedicated to Saint Nicholas), from the 12th century and the 13th-century Geertekerk (dedicated to Saint Gertrude of Nivelles).</p>\\n<h4>City of Utrecht</h4>\\n<p>The location on the banks of the river Rhine allowed Utrecht to become an important trade centre in the Northern Netherlands. The growing town Utrecht was granted city rights by Henry V. in 1122. When the main flow of the Rhine moved south, the old bed, which still flowed through the heart of the town became evermore canalized; and the wharf system was built as an inner city harbour system. On the wharfs storage facilities (<i>werfkelders</i>) were built, on top of which the main street, including houses was constructed. The wharfs and the cellars are accessible from a platform at water level with stairs descending from the street level to form a unique structure. The relations between the bishop, who controlled many lands outside of the city, and the citizens of Utrecht was not always easy. The bishop, for example dammed the Kromme Rijn at Wijk bij Duurstede to protect his estates from flooding. This threatened shipping for the city and led the city of Utrecht to commission a canal to ensure access to the town for shipping trade: the Vaartse Rijn, connecting Utrecht to the Hollandse IJssel at IJsselstein.</p>\\n<h4>The end of independence</h4>\\n<p>In 1528 the bishop lost secular power over both Neder- and Oversticht \\u2013 which included the city of Utrecht \\u2013 to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Charles V combined the Seventeen Provinces (the current Benelux and the northern parts of France) as a personal union. This ended the prince-bishopric Utrecht, as the secular rule was now the lordship of Utrecht, with the religious power remaining with the bishop, although Charles V had gained the right to appoint new bishops. In 1559 the bishopric of Utrecht was raised to archbishopric to make it the religious center of the Northern ecclesiastical province in the Seventeen provinces.</p>\\n<p>The transition from independence to a relatively minor part of a larger union was not easily accepted. To quell uprisings Charles V was struggling to exert his power over the citizens of the city, who had struggled to gain a certain level of independence from the bishops and were not willing to cede this to their new lord. The heavily fortified castle Vredenburg was built to house a large garrison whose main task was to maintain order in the city. The castle would last less than 50\\u00a0years before it was demolished in an uprising in the early stages of the Dutch Revolt.</p>\\n<h3>Republic of the Netherlands (1579\\u20131806)</h3>\\n\\n<p>In 1579 the northern seven provinces signed the Union of Utrecht, in which they decided to join forces against Spanish rule. The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the Dutch Republic. In 1580 the new and predominantly Protestant state abolished the bishoprics, including the archbishopric of Utrecht. The stadtholders disapproved of the independent course of the Utrecht bourgeoisie and brought the city under much more direct control of the republic; which shifted the power towards its dominant province Holland. This was the start of a long period of stagnation of trade and development in Utrecht. Utrecht remained an atypical city in the new republic with about 40% Catholic in the mid-17th century, and even more among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.</p>\\n<p>The fortified city temporarily fell to the French invasion in 1672 (the Disaster Year); where the French invasion was only stopped west of Utrecht at the Old Hollandic Waterline. In 1674, only two years after the French left, the centre of Utrecht was struck by a tornado. The halt to building before construction of flying buttresses in the 15th century now proved to be the undoing of the central section of the cathedral of St Martin church which collapsed; creating the current Dom square between the tower and choir. In 1713, Utrecht hosted one of the first international peace negotiations when the Treaty of Utrecht settled the War of the Spanish Succession. Since 1723 Utrecht became the centre of the non-Roman Old Catholic Churches in the world.</p>\\n<h3>Modern history (1815\\u2013present)</h3>\\n\\n<p>In the early 19th century, the role of Utrecht as a fortified town had become obsolete. The fortifications of the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie were moved east of Utrecht. The town walls could now be demolished to allow for expansion. The moats remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an English style landscape park that remains largely intact today. Growth of the city increased when, in 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the Dutch railway network. With the industrial revolution finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht began to grow far beyond the medieval centre. In 1853, the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by Rome, and Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism once more. From the 1880s onward neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, Wittevrouwen, Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West were developed. New middle class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built in the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, several Jugendstil houses and office buildings were built, followed by Rietveld who built the Rietveld Schr\\u00f6der House (1924), and Dudok's construction of the city theater (1941).</p>\\n<p>During World War II, Utrecht was held by the Germans until the general German surrender of the Netherlands on 5 May 1945. Canadian troops that surrounded the city entered it after that surrender, on 7 May 1945. After the end of World War II, the city has grown considerably when new neighbourhoods such as Overvecht\\u00a0(nl), Kanaleneiland, Hoograven\\u00a0(nl) and Lunetten were built. Around 2000 the city the Leidsche Rijn housing area was developed as the next extension of the city to the west.</p>\\n<p>The area surrounding Utrecht Centraal railway station and the station itself were developed following modernist ideas of the 1960s, in a brutalist style. This led to the construction of the shopping mall Hoog Catharijne\\u00a0(nl), music centre Vredenburg (Hertzberger, 1979), and conversion of part of the ancient canal structure into a highway (Catherijnebaan). Protest against further modernisation of the city centre followed even before the last buildings were finalised. In the early 21st century the whole area is being redeveloped. The music redeveloped music centre opened in 2014 where the original Vredenburg concert and rock and jazz halls are brought together in a single building.<br style=\\\"clear:both;\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n<h3>Topography</h3>\\n<p></p>\\n<h3>Climate</h3>\\n<p>Utrecht experiences a temperate oceanic climate (K\\u00f6ppen climate classification <i>Cfb</i>) similar to almost all of the Netherlands.</p>\\n<h2>Demographics</h2>\\n<p>Inhabitants of Utrecht are called <i>\\u2018Utrechter\\u2019</i> or more rarely <i>\\u2018Utrechtenaar\\u2019</i> as the latter is also Utrecht slang for homosexual.</p>\\n<p>Utrecht city had a population of 296,305 in 2007. Utrecht is a growing municipality and projections are that the city's population will surpass 392,000 by 2025.</p>\\n<p>Utrecht has a young population, with many inhabitants in the age category from 20 and 30\\u00a0years, due to the presence of a large university. About 52% of the population is female, 48% is male. The majority of households (52.5%) in Utrecht are single person households. About 29% of people living in Utrecht are either married, or have another legal partnership. About 3% of the population of Utrecht is divorced.</p>\\n<p>About 69% of the population is of Dutch ancestry. Approximately 10% of the population consists of immigrants from Western countries, while 21% of the population is of non-Western origin (9% Moroccan, 5% Turkish, 3% Surinamese and Dutch Caribbean and 5% of other countries). Some of the city's boroughs have a relatively high percentage of originally non-Dutch inhabitants \\u2013 i.e. Kanaleneiland 83% and Overvecht 57%. Like Rotterdam, Amsterdam, The Hague and other large Dutch cities, Utrecht faces some socio-economic problems. About 38% percent of its population either earns a minimum income or is dependent on social welfare (17% of all households). Boroughs such as Kanaleneiland, Overvecht and Hoograven consist primarily of high-rise housing developments, and are known for relatively high poverty and crime rate.</p>\\n<h3>Population centres and agglomeration</h3>\\n<p>The city of Utrecht is subdivided into 10 city parts which all have their own neighbourhood council and service center for civil affairs.</p>\\n<ul><li>(1) Binnenstad \\u2013 (2) Oost \\u2013 (3) Leidsche Rijn \\u2013 (4) West \\u2013 (5) Overvecht \\u2013 (6) Zuid \\u2013 (7) Noordoost \\u2013 (8) Zuidwest \\u2013 (9) Noordwest \\u2013 (10) Vleuten-De Meern</li>\\n</ul><p>Utrecht is the centre of a densely populated area, which makes concise definitions of its agglomeration difficult, and somewhat arbitrary. The smaller Utrecht agglomeration of continuously built up areas counts some 420,000 inhabitants and includes Nieuwegein, IJsselstein and Maarssen. It is sometimes argued that the close by municipalities De Bilt, Zeist, Houten, Vianen, Driebergen-Rijsenburg (Utrechtse Heuvelrug), and Bunnik should also be counted towards the Utrecht agglomeration, bringing the total to 640,000 inhabitants. The larger region, including slightly more remote towns such as Woerden and Amersfoort counts up to 820,000 inhabitants.</p>\\n<h2>Cityscape</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Utrecht's cityscape is dominated by the Dom Tower, the tallest belfry in the Netherlands and originally part of the Cathedral of Saint Martin. An ongoing debate is if any building in or near the centre of town may surpass the Dom Tower in height (112\\u00a0m). Nevertheless, some tall buildings are now being constructed that will become part of the skyline of Utrecht. The second highest building of the city, the Rabobank-tower, completed in 2010 and standing 105\\u00a0m (344.49\\u00a0ft) tall. Two antennas will increase that height to 120\\u00a0m (393.70\\u00a0ft). Two other buildings were constructed around the Nieuw Galgenwaard stadium (2007). These buildings, the 'Kantoortoren Galghenwert' and 'Apollo Residence', stand 85.5 and 64.5\\u00a0metres high respectively.</p>\\n<p>Another landmark is the old centre and the canal structure in the inner city. The Oudegracht is a curved canal, partly following the ancient main branch of the Rhine. It is lined with the unique wharf-basement structures that create a two-level street along the canals. The inner city has largely retained its Medieval structure, and the moat ringing the old town is largely intact. Because of the role of Utrecht as a fortified city construction outside the medieval centre and its city walls was restricted until the 19th century. Surrounding the medieval core there is a ring of late 19th- and early 20th-century neighbourhoods, with newer neighbourhoods positioned farther out. The eastern part of Utrecht remains fairly open. The Dutch Water Line, moved east of the city in the early 19th century required open lines of fire thus prohibiting all permanent constructions until the middle of the 20th century on the east side of the city.</p>\\n<p>Due to the past importance of Utrecht as a religious centre, several monumental churches were erected, many of which have survived. Most prominent is the Dom Church. Other notable churches include the romanesque St Peter's and St John's churches, the gothic churches of St James and St Nicholas, and the Buurkerk, now converted into a museum for automatically playing musical instruments .</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<h3>Public transport</h3>\\n<p>Because of its central location, Utrecht is well connected to the rest of the Netherlands and has a well-developed public transport network.</p>\\n<h4>Heavy and light rail</h4>\\n\\n<p>Utrecht Centraal is the main railway station of Utrecht. There are regular intercity services to all major Dutch cities; direct services to Schiphol Airport. Utrecht Centraal is a station on the night service, providing 7 days a week an all night service to (among others) Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam and Rotterdam. International InterCityExpress (ICE) services to Germany (and further) through Arnhem call at Utrecht Centraal. Regular local trains to all areas surrounding Utrecht also depart from Utrecht Centraal; and service several smaller stations: Utrecht Lunetten, Utrecht Vaartsche Rijn, Utrecht Overvecht, Utrecht Leidsche Rijn, Utrecht Terwijde, Utrecht Zuilen and Vleuten. A former station Utrecht Maliebaan closed in 1939 and has since been converted into the Dutch Railway Museum.</p>\\n<p>The Utrecht sneltram is a light rail scheme running southwards from Utrecht Centraal to the suburbs of IJsselstein, Kanaleneiland, Lombok and Nieuwegein. The sneltram began operations in 1983 and is currently operated by the private transport company Qbuzz. In 2018 the new extension to the Uithof will start operating creating a direct mass transit connection from the central station to the main Utrecht university campus.</p>\\n<p>Utrecht is the location of the headquarters of Nederlandse Spoorwegen (English: <i>Dutch Railways</i>) \\u2013 the largest rail operator in the Netherlands \\u2013 and ProRail \\u2013 the state-owned company responsible for the construction and maintenance of the country's rail infrastructure.</p>\\n<h4>Bus transport</h4>\\n<p>The main local and regional bus station of Utrecht is located adjacent to Utrecht Centraal railway station, at the East and West entrances. Due to large scale renovation and construction works at the railway station, the station's bus stops are changing frequently. As a general rule, westbound buses depart from the bus station on the west entrance, other buses from the east side station. Local buses in Utrecht are operated by Qbuzz \\u2013 its services include a high-frequency service to the Uithof university district. The local bus fleet is one of Europe's cleanest, using only buses compliant with the Euro-VI standard as well as electric buses for inner city transport. Regional buses from the city are operated by Arriva, Connexxion, Qliner and Veolia.</p>\\n<p>The Utrecht Centraal railway station is also served by the pan-European services of Eurolines. Furthermore, it acts as departure and arrival place of many coach companies serving holiday resorts in Spain and France \\u2013 and during winter in Austria and Switzerland.</p>\\n<h3>Cycling</h3>\\n<p>Like most Dutch cities, Utrecht has an extensive network of cycle paths, making cycling safe and popular. 33% of journeys within the city are by bicycle, more than any other mode of transport. (Cars, for example, account for 19% of trips). Bicycles are used by young and old people, and by individuals and families. They are mostly traditional, upright, steel-framed bicycles, with few or no gears. There are also barrow bikes, for carrying shopping or small children. As thousands of bicycles are parked haphazardly in town, creating an eyesore but also impeding pedestrians, the City Council decided in 2014 to build the world's largest bicycle parking station, near the Central Railway Station. This 3-floor construction will cost an estimated 48 million Euro and will hold 12,500 bicycles. Completion is foreseen in 2018.</p>\\n<h3>Road transport</h3>\\n<p>Utrecht is well-connected to the Dutch road network. Two of the most important major roads serve the city of Utrecht: the A12 and A2 motorways connect Amsterdam, Arnhem, The Hague and Maastricht, as well as Belgium and Germany. Other major motorways in the area are the Almere\\u2013Breda A27 and the Utrecht\\u2013Groningen A28. Due to the increasing traffic and the ancient city plan, traffic congestion is a common phenomenon in and around Utrecht, causing elevated levels of air pollutants. This has led to a passionate debate in the city about the best way to improve the city's air quality.</p>\\n<h3>Shipping</h3>\\n<p>Utrecht has an industrial port located on the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal. The container terminal has a capacity of 80,000 containers a year. In 2003, the port facilitated the transport of four million tons of cargo; mostly sand, gravel, fertilizer and fodder. Additionally, some tourist boat trips are organised from various places on the Oudegracht; and the city is connected to touristic shipping routes through sluices.</p>\\n<h2>Economy</h2>\\n\\n<p>Production industry constitutes as small part of the economy of Utrecht. The economy of Utrecht depends for a large part on the several large institutions located in the city. It is the centre of the Dutch railroad network and the location of the head office of Nederlandse Spoorwegen. ProRail. is headquartered in The <i>De Inktpot\\u00a0(nl)</i> (The Inkpot) \\u2013 the largest brick building in the Netherlands (the \\\"UFO\\\" featured on its fa\\u00e7ade stems from an art program in 2000). Rabobank, a large bank, has its headquarters in Utrecht.</p>\\n<p>A large indoor shopping centre Hoog Catharijne\\u00a0(nl) is located between Utrecht Centraal railway station and the city centre. The corridors are treated as public places like streets, and the route between the station and the city centre is open all night. In 20\\u00a0years from 2004, parts of Hoog Catharijne will be redeveloped as part of the renovation of the larger station area. Parts of the city's network of canals, which were filled to create the shopping center and central station area, will be recreated. The Jaarbeurs, one of the largest convention centres in the Netherlands, is located at the west side of the central railway station.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>Utrecht host several large institutions of higher education. The most prominent of these is Utrecht University (est. 1636), the largest university of the Netherlands with 29,927 students (as of 2009). The university is partially based in the inner city as well as in the Uithof campus area, on the east of the city. According to Shanghai Jiaotong University's university ranking in 2010 it is the 50th best university in the world. Utrecht also houses the much smaller University of Humanistic Studies, which houses about 400 students.</p>\\n<p>Utrecht is home of one of the locations of TIAS School for Business and Society, focused on post-experience management education and the largest management school of its kind in the Netherlands. In 2008, its executive MBA program was rated the 24th best program in the world by the <i>Financial Times</i>.</p>\\n<p>Utrecht is also home to two other large institutions of higher education: the Hogeschool Utrecht (37,000 students), with locations in the city and the Uithof campus, and the HKU Utrecht School of the Arts (3,000 students).</p>\\n<p>There are many schools for primary and secondary education; allowing parent to select from different philosophies and religions in the school as is inherent in the Dutch school system.</p>\\n<h2>Culture</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>Utrecht city has an active cultural life, and in the Netherlands is second only to Amsterdam. There are several theatres and theatre companies. The 1941 main city theatre was built by Dudok. Besides theatres there is a large number of cinemas including three arthouse cinemas. Utrecht is host to the international Early Music Festival (Festival Oude Muziek, for music before 1800) and the Netherlands Film Festival. The city has an important classical music hall Vredenburg (1979 by Herman Hertzberger). Its acoustics are considered among the best of the 20th-century original music halls. The original Vredenburg music hall has been redeveloped as part of the larger station area redevelopment plan and has gained additional halls that allowed its merger with the rock club Tivoli, and the SJU jazzpodium. There are several other venues for music throughout the city. Young musicians are educated in the conservatory (a department of the Utrecht School of the Arts). There is a specialised museum of automatically playing musical instruments.</p>\\n<p>There are many art galleries in Utrecht. There are also several foundations to support art, and artists. Training of artists is done at the Utrecht School of the Arts. The Centraal Museum has many exhibitions on the arts, including a permanent exhibition on the works of Utrecht resident illustrator Dick Bruna, who is best known for creating Miffy (\\\"Nijntje\\\", in Dutch). Utrecht also houses one of the landmarks of modern architecture, the 1924 Rietveld Schr\\u00f6der House, which is listed on UNESCO's world heritage sites.</p>\\n<p>Every Saturday a paviour adds another letter to The Letters of Utrecht, an endless poem in the cobblestones of the Oude Gracht in Utrecht. With the <i>Letters</i>, Utrecht has a social sculpture as a growing monument created for the benefit of future people.</p>\\n<p>To promote the larger the city population as a whole Utrecht city organizes cultural Sundays. During a thematic Sunday several organisations create a program, which is open to everyone without, or with a very much reduced, admission fee. Furthermore there are many initiatives for amateur artists. The city subsidises an organisation for amateur education in arts aimed at all inhabitants (Utrechts Centrum voor de Kunsten), as does the university for its staff and students. Additionally there are also several private initiatives. The city council provides coupons for discounts to inhabitants who receive welfare to be used with many of the initiatives.</p>\\n<h3>Sports</h3>\\n\\n<p>Utrecht is home to the premier league (professional) football club FC Utrecht, which plays in Stadium Nieuw Galgenwaard. It is also the home of Kampong, the largest (amateur) sportsclub in the Netherlands (4,500 members), SV Kampong. Kampong features fieldhockey, soccer, cricket, tennis, squash and jeu de boules. Kampong's men and women top hockey squads play in the highest Dutch hockey league, the Rabohoofdklasse. Utrecht's waterways are used by several rowing clubs. Viking is a large club open to the general public, and the student clubs Orca and Triton compete in the Varsity each year.</p>\\n<p>In the summer of 2013, Utrecht hosted the European Youth Olympic Festival, in which more than 2,000 young athletes competed in nine different olympic sports. In July 2015 Utrecht will host the Grand D\\u00e9part and first stage the Tour de France.</p>\\n<h3>Museums</h3>\\n\\n<p>Utrecht has several smaller and larger museums.

The older parts date to a monastery of the Bailiwick of Utrecht of the Teutonic Knights founded in 1348. Originally Catholic, the order became Protestant during the Reformation. A military hospital was added in 1823 after the knights had sold the property. The property was sold back to the Bailiwick of Utrecht and a major renovation started in 1992. Some of the older buildings are again the headquarters of the Bailiwick of Utrecht, now a charity, and hold an important collection of medieval manuscripts, coins and pictures. Other buildings, including the former hospital, have been converted into a five-star hotel, the Grand Hotel Karel V.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Teutonic Order</h2>\\n<p>The Teutonic Order was one of the great Christian military orders, along with the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller. It was mainly active in the Holy Land and the Baltic region, but had many branches in the west to provide sources of funds and of recruits. The Bailiwick of Utrecht of the Teutonic Order (<i>Ridderlijke Duitse Orde Balije van Utrecht</i>) was founded in 1231, initially focused mainly on the spiritual development of its own members. The order held agricultural lands, called commanderies, in different areas of the Netherlands, The knights and priests had taken the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. In 1348 the order built the <i>Duitse Huis</i> as a monastery and headquarters between the city wall and Springweg in Utrecht.</p>\\n<p>The Emperor Charles V (1500-1558) visited Utrecht between 30 December 1545 and 3 February 1546. A meeting of the chapter of the order of the Golden Fleece began on 2 January 1546, attended by Charles V and his sister Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands). Kings Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France, both knights of the order, were present at this important event. The meetings of the chapter and the feasts took place in the <i>Duitse Huis</i>.</p>\\n<p>By 1580 the States of Utrecht were demanding that Catholic institutions such as the Bailiwick be dissolved and their goods used for charity. The land commander in 1579\\u20131612, Jacob Taets van Amerongen, resisted on the basis that the goods \\\"belonged to our Lord the German Master\\\", and that the Bailiwick was a knightly institution that served \\\"where necessary to fight with weapons for the defence of the Empire against our common arch enemy, the Turk...\\\" However, in 1637 the knights formally accepted the protection of the United Provinces of the Netherlands. They remained an order of Teutonic Knights, but were no longer Catholic.</p>\\n<ul class=\\\"gallery mw-gallery-packed\\\"><li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 134.66666666667px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 181.33333333333px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 181.33333333333px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 154px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n</ul><h2>Buildings</h2>\\n\\n<p>From 17th century drawings it appears that the church was a large building, standing high over its surroundings. Most of the land commanders of the order were buried there, as were prominent citizens of Utrecht. One bay has survived, just over 5.5 metres (18\\u00a0ft) wide. There were probably seven or eight such bays, and perhaps a small transept. The main building contained the chapter room and the refectory, sometimes called the \\\"Queens room\\\", where the knights ate. Many dignitaries were entertained with elaborate feasts in the refectory. The commander's house, at right angles to the main building, was closed to the public. The commander's room was on the west side of the first floor, and there were two smaller reception rooms to the east of this floor.</p>\\n<p>The chapter room was renovated in the second half of the 16th century. The work was probably done between 1550 and 1580 to accommodate growing numbers of visiting dignitaries, but may have been undertaken after 1580 due to the ban on public Catholic worship, or in preparation for the 1586 visit by the Calvinist governor-general of the United Provinces, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. The joists above the hall were raised and new corbels were put in. The former Gothic windows were raised and converted to bay windows. The wall posts were moved to give a symmetrical layout with a stone mantelpiece in the center of the north wall. From that date the walls may have been hung with tapestries.</p>\\n<p>In 1674 the monastery was badly damaged by a windstorm. The church was ruined, and it was demolished. The sacristy, main building, kitchen with outbuildings and Commander's house remained standing. The \\\"knights room\\\" in the commander's house was used as a replacement church. In 1700 the 14th-century facade was truncated.</p>\\n<h2>Hospital</h2>\\n<p>Napoleon's brother Louis Bonaparte bought the property in 1807. The French government planned to convert the complex into a military hospital, and the Teutonic Order had to move to a new building on the canal. On 27 February 1811 the Teutonic Order was abolished in the Kingdom of Holland and its estates were confiscated. After the fall of Napoleon and the restoration of the House of Orange, on 8 August 1815 the Bailiwick was revived by royal decree of William I of the Netherlands. During the reign of King William I a very modern hospital building (for the time) was built on the property along the Geertebolwerk. The hospital was completed in 1823, and remained military property until 1990. The <i>Duitse Huis</i> was registered as a national monument on 20 June 1967. The complex was poorly maintained, and for a few years was occupied by squatters. In 1990 the Military Hospital moved to the Uithof.</p>\\n<ul class=\\\"gallery mw-gallery-packed\\\"><li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 154.66666666667px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 121.33333333333px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 120.66666666667px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 120.66666666667px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 122.66666666667px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n</ul><h2>Recent years</h2>\\n<h3>Bailiwick of Utrecht</h3>\\n<p>When the military hospital became vacant in the late 1980s the Bailiwick of Utrecht was able to repurchase the property due to an agreement dating back to 1808. A major renovation was started in 1992. The 14th century facade was restored during the renovation. In 1995 the Bailiwick of Utrecht moved back into the 15th century Commander's house on the corner of Springweg and Walsteeg. The order has become a charity that assists people with disabilities, the homeless and drug addicts.</p>\\n<p>The Teutonic Order in the Netherlands converted to Calvinism in time, so they were able to preserve their property, including archival records dating back to the start of the 13th century. The Bailiwick of Utrecht has a collection of historical items in the <i>Duitse Huis</i> including many old charters with seals and a collection of medieval coins. The well-preserved archive is open to researchers. The <i>Duitse Huis</i> has several impressive rooms, including the meeting room for the officers of the Bailiwick. The walls have portraits of every <i>Landcommandeur</i> from the order's foundation. All but the most recent are depicted in armor with a mantle over their shoulders. The old buildings, surrounded by tall trees in a fenced area, are an oasis of tranquility in the center of modern Utrecht.</p>\\n<ul class=\\\"gallery mw-gallery-packed\\\"><li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 295.33333333333px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 302.66666666667px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n</ul><h3>Hotel</h3>\\n\\n<p>Further renovations converted much of the complex into a hotel. The hospital's wards were converted into hotel rooms and suites. The Grand Hotel Karel V, a five-star hotel, opened in part of the building complex in 1999. The hotel has 121 rooms, conference rooms, a health center, bar, brasserie and restaurant. The former chapter room and former refectory are now dining areas. The remains of a fireplace were found during the renovation on which the double-headed eagle, the emblem of Charles V, was engraved in sandstone. A new fireplace has been built in the same place in the former refectory as the old fireplace with the coat of arms and motto of Charles V.</p>\\n<p>During the restoration archaeologists discovered the remains of a Roman cemetery dating to between 40 BC and 275 AD. This may be associated with the Roman fort of Traiectum. The garden wing was renovated and extended in 2007 and renamed the Roman wing after this discovery. There are traces of the past history of the complex including objects, photographs and historical drawings displayed in locations throughout the hotel.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<p><b>Citations</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Sources</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Further reading</b></p>\"},{\"dim\":1250,\"dist\":1327.3,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":1191676,\"title\":\"Geert Wilders\",\"text\":\"<p>In 1997, Wilders was elected for the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) to the municipal council of Utrecht, the fourth largest city of the Netherlands.

The tower was part of the Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht, also known as Dom Church, and was built between 1321 and 1382, to a design by John of Hainaut. The cathedral was never fully completed due to lack of money. Since the unfinished nave collapsed in 1674 the Dom tower became a free standing tower.</p>\\n<p>The tower stands at the spot where the city of Utrecht originated almost 2,000 years ago.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Design and construction</h2>\\n<p>The Dom Tower was one of the largest towers constructed in Europe during the fourteenth century, and it was planned to show the power of the church of Utrecht. Its construction led preacher Geert Groote to protest against the vanity of such an immense project, suggesting it was too tall, too expensive and all but aesthetic.</p>\\n<p>The tower consists of two square blocks, topped by a much lighter lantern. One of the most striking features is the absence of visible buttresses. Its particular shape and original architecture had a large influence on many other towers in the Netherlands, including the Martinitoren in Groningen. Upon completion in 1382 the tower stood 109 metres tall. However this height was increased during the restorations in 1910, to its present height of 112.5 metres.</p>\\n<p>The Dom tower was a multifunctional building. In addition to being a belfry, it contained a private chapel of the bishop of Utrecht on the first floor. It also served as the watchtower; the tower guard was housed on the second floor of the lower square block.</p>\\n<h2>Bells</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Dom Tower has an exceptional peal of fourteen ringing bells, weighing 32,000\\u00a0kg. In 1505 Geert van Wou, in his time the most famous bell-founder of the Netherlands, made a harmonious peal of thirteen bells. The seven smallest bells, sold in 1664 to finance the new carillion, were recast in 1982 by Eijsbouts. The largest bell, the <i>Salvator</i>, has a weight of 8,200\\u00a0kg and a diameter of 227\\u00a0cm. Together with the fourteenth bell, they form the largest existing homogeneous group of medieval bells. Today the bells are set in motion by the members of the Utrecht Klokkenluiders Gilde.</p>\\n<p>In 1625, Jacob van Eyck became carillon player of the Dom Tower. In 1664, a new carillon was installed by Juriaan Sprakel of Zutphen, with a mechanism consisting of 35 chimes, made by the brothers Pieter and Fran\\u00e7ois Hemony. In 1972 the carillon was restored and extended to 50 bells.</p>\\n<h2>Storm Damage</h2>\\n<p>The cathedral's nave was never completely finished, and in 1674 a tornado destroyed this part of the cathedral, but the tower was undamaged.</p>\\n<p>The remaining section of the church and the tower were never reconnected, and a street and Domplein square now separate the two structures. In the summer of 2004, however, a mock nave was constructed out of scaffolding to commemorate the missing link. The floorplan of the missing section is shown by the multicoloured paving of the square.</p>\\n<p>In 1836 the top floor of the tower was heavily damaged in a storm. Demolition of the tower was seriously considered, however it was subsequently restored, which took five years.</p>\\n<h2>Tourism and weddings</h2>\\n<p>The tower has its own visitor centre, RonDom (a Portmanteau of 'Rond' -around- and 'Dom'), which is located in the square. As well as stocking a range of souvenirs, they organise a number of activities centred on the tower, including regular guided tours which allow people to climb the 465 steps to the top of the Dom Tower. On a clear day it is possible to see both Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The booking office for guided tours is located in the square at the foot of the tower. It is also possible to get married in the tower.</p>\\n<h2>Radio DOM (1999)</h2>\\n<p>Radio DOM was an automatic radio-station located on the Dom tower in Utrecht, which from June 4, 1999 until October 3, 1999 broadcast an audio 'soundscape' based on the sounds of the city of Utrecht. Radio DOM got its inputs from six computer-controlled surveillance microphones installed at a height of 80 metres on the Dom tower, which constantly scanned the central area of the city. The sound signals picked up by these microphones were algorithmically combined into a continuously varying soundscape which was broadcast 24 hours a day by an FM radio transmitter installed on the Dom tower.</p>\\n<p>Broadcast on 102.3\\u00a0MHz FM, Radio DOM was part of the exhibition Panorama 2000, organised by the Centraal Museum in Utrecht.</p>\\n<h2>Local planning restrictions</h2>\\n<p>Until recently, the unwritten rule in evaluating planning applications in the city of Utrecht was that no building could be built that exceeded the Dom Tower in height. This restriction seems to have been dispensed for plans in the developing suburban area in the west of Utrecht (Leidsche Rijn) and a skyscraper of 262 metres in height has been proposed, challenging this long-standing tradition. The plans for this tower, however, have been cancelled due to the economic crisis.</p>\\n<h2>Panoramas</h2>\\n\\n\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Utrechts Klokkenluiders Gilde</li>\\n<li>Utrechtse Klokkenspel Vereniging</li>\\n<li>Webcam Live Domtoren Utrecht</li>\\n<li>How the tower was built (Dutch, but with useful illustrations)</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":1529.9,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":141558,\"title\":\"Princess Christina of the Netherlands\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Princess Maria Christina of the Netherlands</b> (born 18 February 1947) is the youngest of four daughters born to Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Princess_Christina_of_the_Netherlands_1968.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q435324\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":0}],\"type\":\"landmark\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Dom_voor_storm.jpg\",\"title\":\"St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht\",\"lon\":5.1216666666667,\"wikidata\":\"Q936545\",\"lat\":52.090833333333,\"pageid\":210179,\"ns\":0,\"extract\":\"<p><b>St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht</b>, or <b>Dom Church</b> (Dutch: <i>Domkerk</i>) was the cathedral of the Diocese of Utrecht during the Middle Ages. Once the Netherlands' largest church, dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours, it is one of the country's two pre-Reformation cathedrals, along with the cathedral in Middelburg, Zeeland. It has been a Protestant church since 1580. The building is the one church in the Netherlands that closely resembles the style of classic Gothic architecture as developed in France. All other Gothic churches in the Netherlands belong to one of the many regional variants. Unlike most of its French predecessors, the building has only one tower, the 112-metre-high (367\\u00a0ft) Dom Tower, which is the hallmark of the city.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The first chapel in Utrecht was founded around 630 by Frankish clergy under the patronage of the Merovingian kings but was destroyed during an attack of the Frisians on Utrecht shortly thereafter. The site of this first chapel within Utrecht is unknown. Saint Willibrord (died 739), the Apostle to the Frisians, established a second chapel devoted to Saint Martin on (or close to) the site of the current building. This church was destroyed by the Normans in the 9th century during one of their many raids on Utrecht, but was reconstructed by Bishop Balderic in the 10th century. During this period St. Martin's came to be the principal church of Utrecht, see of the bishop. The church had its own small territorial close (known as an \\\"immunity\\\") and was led by a cathedral chapter of canons, who generally belonged to the nobility.</p>\\n<p>The church was repeatedly destroyed by fires and then rebuilt. A Romanesque style church was built by Bishop Adalbold and consecrated in 1023. It is thought to have been the center of a cross-shaped conglomeration of 5 churches, called a <i>Kerkenkruis</i>, built to commemorate Conrad II. This building, also known as Adalbold's Dom, was partially destroyed in the fire of 1253 which ravaged much of Utrecht, leading Bishop Henry van Vianen to initiate the construction of the current Gothic structure in 1254. The construction of the Gothic cathedral continued into the 16th century. The first part to be built was the choir. The Dom Tower was started in 1321 and finished in 1382. After 1515, steadily diminishing financing prevented completion of this building project, of which an almost complete series of building accounts exists. In 1566, the <i>Beeldenstorm</i> or Iconoclast Fury swept across much of the Low Countries, justified by the Calvinist belief that statues in a house of God were idolatrous images which must be destroyed. As a result, many of the ornaments on both the exterior and interior of the cathedral were destroyed.</p>\\n<p>In 1580 the Utrecht city government devolved the cathedral from the Diocese of Utrecht to local Calvinists. From then on Protestant services were held in the building with one brief exception, in 1672 and 1673, during the Franco-Dutch War, when Catholic masses were again held in the cathedral. A year after the French retreat, the still unfinished and insufficiently supported nave collapsed on 1 August 1674 during a massive storm that caused a tornado. Over the subsequent centuries, much of the enormous building fell into further neglect. The pitiable state of the cathedral led to some small restoration activities in the nineteenth century, followed by major renovations in the early twentieth century with the aim of returning the Cathedral to its original state. However, the nave was never rebuilt.</p>\\n<p>The Catholic Church remained strong within Utrecht following the Reformation but was legally obliged to worship discretely in clandestine churches (<i>schuilkerken</i>). One of these churches, St. Gertrude's, later became the principal cathedral of the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands.</p>\\n<p>The Catholic Church, during the 1853 reestablishment of the episcopal hierarchy in the Netherlands, designated the former St. Catherine's church of the Carmelites as the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht.</p>\\n<h2>The church today</h2>\\n<p>What remains of St. Martin's today are the choir, the transept and the Dom Tower. The central nave of the cathedral which collapsed in the storm of 1674 is now a square with large trees, the <i>Domplein\\u00a0(nl)</i>. Stones in various colours indicate in the pavement the original outlines of the church.</p>\\n<p>In 2004, 750 years after construction began, the collapsed parts were temporarily rebuilt in scaffolding material. The scaffolding has since been taken down.</p>\\n<p>In 2013 a project has started to expose archaeological artifacts of the St. Martin cathedral.</p>\\n<ul class=\\\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\\\"><li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n</ul><p>A cloister and a chapter house, which is now the main hall of Utrecht University, are also still standing. The Union of Utrecht, a founding document of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, was signed in the chapter house.</p>\\n<h2>Burials and memorials in the Dom</h2>\\n<p>Utrecht was an important city in the western Holy Roman Empire and had particularly close links to the imperial Salian dynasty. In the early Middle Ages the Holy Roman Emperor was always an honorary canon of the cathedral. The Emperor Conrad II and the Emperor Henry V both died in Utrecht in 1039 and 1125 respectively. Their bowels and hearts were interred in the cathedral. The modest \\\"Emperors' stones\\\" (<i>keizerssteentjes</i>) in the floor of the choir of the cathedral are a reminder of this fact.</p>\\n<p>The only medieval tomb of importance to remain relatively unscathed in the cathedral is that of 14th century Bishop Guy of Avesnes \\u2013 the brother of John II, Count of Holland, Hainaut , and Zeeland.</p>\\n<p>There are many other beautifully carved burial slabs and memorials in the cathedral. Of particular note is the monumental cenotaph, which contained the heart of 16th century Bishop George van Egmond.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n<ul><li>Borst, P.

The stadium was the host of two World Cup finals: the first, was the Hockey World Cup final; and the second was in 2005, for the final of the Football World Youth Championships.</p>\\n<h2>Results</h2>\\n<h3>Pool A</h3>\\n<dl><dd>\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Qualified for semifinals</dd>\\n</dl><h3>Pool B</h3>\\n<dl><dd>\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Qualified for semifinals</dd>\\n</dl><h3>Fifth to twelfth place classification</h3>\\n<h4>Ninth to twelfth qualifiers</h4>\\n<h4>Eleventh and twelfth place</h4>\\n<h4>Ninth and tenth place</h4>\\n<h4>Fifth to eighth qualifiers</h4>\\n<h4>Seventh and eighth place</h4>\\n<h4>Fifth and sixth place</h4>\\n<h3>First to fourth place classification</h3>\\n<h4>Semi-finals</h4>\\n<h4>Third and fourth place</h4>\\n<h4>Final</h4>\\n<p><br></p>\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>FIH page on the 1998 Men's Hockey World Cup</li>\\n<li>Rediff page</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":2865.4,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":9130986,\"title\":\"Bryan Reynolds\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Bryan Reynolds</b> (born 1965), Chancellor's Professor at the University of California-Irvine, is an American critical theorist, performance theorist, and Shakespeare scholar who developed the combined social theory, performance aesthetics, and research methodology known as transversal poetics.

UCU is a selective liberal arts, undergraduate college of 700 students within Utrecht University. Located between the two UU sites, Uithof and City Center, it has its own residential campus in the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands. The language of instruction is English.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Campus</h2>\\n<p>UCU's residential and educational Campus is located at the former Kromhout Kazerne, a turn of the century military base that used to be part of the Dutch Water Line. The students live in the oldest quarter of the base, the other three quarters remain in possession of the Dutch Ministry of Defense.</p>\\n<h3>Room and Board</h3>\\n<p>Students are housed in student accommodation on the Campus terrain. The Dining Hall provides two meals throughout term-time. The college also has its own student-run bar, <i>The UCSA College Bar</i>.</p>\\n<p>During the summer most students leave the campus and there is only limited accommodation to stay on campus. Upon return the next year the students move into a new room, a new 'unit', with new housemates. The houses have 2 to 12 private rooms and shared communal spaces (bathroom facilities and a living room with a kitchenette).</p>\\n<h3>Student Population</h3>\\n<p>As of 2010 University College Utrecht consisted of 723 students. Of these 723 students, 64% are of Dutch nationality. The remaining 36% are made up of a wide range of nationalities. All students are automatically members of the University College Student Association (UCSA) which organises social and creative activities and is led by the UCSA Board, which consists of six members that are annually elected. Additionally, the Academic Student Council (ASC) defends students' interests in academic matters. Like the UCSA Board, the ASC members are annually elected by the students. Finally, there are two fraternities (Disputum Primus Erectus and Onafhankelijk Heeren Genootschap Equites) and two sororities (Luna and Onafhankelijk Dames Dispuut Allure).</p>\\n<h3>Life on campus</h3>\\n<p>The 750 students at UCU form a tight community and are in constant contact with each other. This is because of the relatively small size of the campus, the wide variety of activities organised by the several dozen UCSA committees, the campus bar, several fraternities and sororities and mixed on-campus housing. The campus bar is the heart of campus life. Especially every Tuesday and Thursday and on special nights the bar is packed with a large part of the students living at UCU, as well as alumni and off-campus friends.</p>\\n<p>The student committees are also an important part of campus life. Activities include such things as sports, music and politics. To emphasize the international character of the college, UCU organises a much appraised Model United Nations every year; UNISUN.</p>\\n<h3>Academic Buildings</h3>\\n\\n<p>The classes are in three academic buildings. These stand around the central quad on both sides of the College Hall. Each is named after a famous scientist/philosopher:</p>\\n<ul><li>Voltaire houses the Humanities department which covers History, Philosophy, Religious Studies, Literature, Art History, Museum Studies, and Linguistics.</li>\\n<li>Locke houses the Social Sciences Department which covers Law, Psychology, Political Sciences, Human Geography, Economics, Anthropology and Sociology.</li>\\n<li>Newton houses the Sciences Department which covers Cognitive Neuroscience, Life Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Earth Sciences. Historically appropriate, the Newton building is endowed with a 'Leibniz room'.</li>\\n</ul><p>There is a fourth academic building, that used to be part of the UCU teaching environment, but is currently not used by UCU anymore. The building is called Descartes and it used to house the Academic Core courses. (Like languages and obligatory courses).</p>\\n<h2>Selection of Students</h2>\\n<p>Students admission policy is based on merit, broad academic interest, and motivation. The application procedure includes submission of a letter of motivation, references, an English proficiency requirement, as well as an interview: all this is highly unusual in the Netherlands. It is also still very controversial legally and socially; as a result UCU has acquired somewhat of a reputation for elitism and snobbery, which is occasionally expressed in both national and regional press. This is reflected by studies which focused on student satisfaction and overall quality by magazines like Elsevier etc. UCU's student body is largely of a comparable socio-economic background to the general university population in the Netherlands. Many Dutch and international UCU students need to find loans and jobs, which is not easy given the intensity of the College's academic programme. For this reason, UCU has established a Student Aid Fund and is actively seeking funds; the College has recently encountered difficulties securing scholarships for foreign students. An additional challenge towards UCU's aim to ensure a broad and diverse international student population have been recent government actions that have made it more difficult for some foreigners to obtain a residence permit for the Netherlands.</p>\\n<h2>Academics</h2>\\n<p>UCU is a three year undergraduate programme leading to a B.Sc. or B.A. in Liberal Arts and Sciences. The College offers no Masters courses, but students have direct access to those offered at the University of Utrecht. Students of UCU are also students of the University of Utrecht and therefore also have access to all its services, such as libraries.</p>\\n<h3>Ranking</h3>\\n<p>UCU has been on top of the national rankings in the pastIn the 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 issues of Elsevier magazine\\u2019s extensive survey among Dutch institutes of higher education, students rated UCU as the best university college in the country.</p>\\n<p>In the 2013 national student survey (Nationale Studentenenquete or NSE) UCU ranked highest among Utrecht University's bachelor programs.</p>\\n<p>The Keuzegids (study choice guide) 2014 has awarded University College Utrecht the 'Top Rated Programme' quality seal. The Keuzegids assessed about 400 bachelor programs on success rates, quality of education, quality of teaching, facilities and more. UCU scored particularly well on the scientific content of the program, teachers and communication.</p>\\n<p>The 2013 Academic Ranking of World Universities conducted by Shanghai University ranks Utrecht University as #1 in the Netherlands, #13 in Europe and #52 in the world. The research focused Shanghai ranking is an influential index of universities worldwide.</p>\\n<p>The World University Rankings 2011-12 conducted by British magazine Times Higher Education ranks Utrecht University as #1 in the Netherlands, #18 in Europe and #68 in the world.</p>\\n<p>UCU is accredited by the NVAO, the Accreditation Organization of the Netherlands and Flanders.</p>\\n<h3>Academic calendar</h3>\\n<p>The academic year begins in the last week of August or first week of September and it is divided in two semesters of 15 weeks (including one week Mid-term Break). And each semester a student takes 4 courses. There is an optional 5 week Summer or Third Term, during which a student takes one course that can be used to acquire extra credit, to do a special course (such as a Laboratory Course), or to compensate for a failed course.</p>\\n<h3>Courses</h3>\\n<p>After their first year students elect a major in either Humanities, Social Sciences, Sciences, a double major in any two of these or an interdepartmental major in a combination of these. In the latter cases a student will have to make a convincing argument to the Director of Education.</p>\\n<p>Students are encouraged to experiment in combining courses, thereby encouraging multidisciplinary research and interests. In any major a student needs to take 10 courses, of which three at the advanced level and in at least two different fields of study. This will lead to the BA degree (Bachelor of Arts). A BSc degree (Bachelor of Science) requires 12 courses in the Sciences department, the extra two courses being two lab courses to be taken in the Summer or Third term. Furthermore, a student is required to take at least one course in each department, learn one new foreign language, and pass the core courses Academic English &amp; Introduction to academia, and one course appropriate to the major.</p>\\n<p>Each course is worth 4 UCU credits (or 7.5 ECTS). There is continuous assessment based on papers/essays, presentations, class participation and exams. Grades are on the A-F scale (A being 4.0). First year courses are not factored into the students overall grade point average. Therefore, students are only accounted for their second and third courses when applying to graduate programs.</p>\\n<h3>Exchange programmes</h3>\\n<p>Apart from taking courses at other universities in the Netherlands, UCU students have the opportunity to go on exchange to a wide variety of highly respected universities worldwide from the University of California to Kyoto University.</p>\\n<h3><i>Eidos</i></h3>\\n<p>The College also publishes its own academic magazine <i>Eidos</i> with an editorial board consisting of both staff and students. The editors are usually students. Every summer it combines the 10 most interesting and best of the student papers produced during the last academic year with a specially themed photography series, commissioned by one of the students.</p>\\n<h2>History and Philosophy</h2>\\n<p>Founded in 1998 by Hans Adriaansens and formally founded in 1999, UCU was the first honors college of the Netherlands. Subsequently an honors program was initiated in Maastricht, University College Maastricht, and recently Hans Adriaansens founded the Roosevelt Academy in Middelburg which was elected as the best university college in the Netherlands by The Keuzegids Onderwijs 2011 and is also a part of Utrecht University. In 2009, the University of Amsterdam opened a similar style college.</p>\\n<p>Hans Adriaansens wanted to offer students an alternative to the great 'education factories' that are, in his opinion, the Dutch universities: impersonal, inefficient, and one-size-fits-all. He started UCU amongst others to get the discussion on Higher Education in the Netherlands going: there should be more attention to the highest performers if the Netherlands wanted to keep competitive in the world market.</p>\\n<p>Hans Adriaansens' selective colleges are still highly controversial in the Netherlands. There is still some doubt as to the legality of UCU's practices, as the Dutch law guarantees access to Higher Education to all in the possession of a <i>VWO</i>-diploma (Cf. English A-levels) and university education cannot be denied. UCU exploits a loophole in this law by having students apply to a programme at Utrecht University and only afterwards 'inviting' them to come and study at UCU, which is a 'master-class' of several of Utrecht University's other departments. Hence the title 'Honors College'.</p>\\n<h2>Alumni</h2>\\n<p>Alumni of UCU have been accepted into programmes at universities worldwide, such as Princeton University, the Technical University of Munich, University of Oxford, Leiden University, University of Cambridge, the London School of Economics, the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, University of Amsterdam, University of Edinburgh, University of Nottingham, Stockholm University, University of Gothenburg, University of Geneva, Xiamen University, INSEAD, Harvard University, and into the University of California System, while some have continued their studies at UCU's mother university Utrecht University. UCU's alumni are represented by the University College Alumni Association (UCAA).</p>\\n<p>In June 2007, University College Utrecht was evaluated on many facets by a unique joint commission consisting of both a council from QANU, an independent assessor of higher education programs in the Netherlands, as well as delegates from the American Higher Learning Commission. The report graded the quality of its education and the level achieved as \\\"excellent\\\". It praised UCU's ambitious international mission and found the college to be in an outstanding position to develop its own brand of Liberal Arts and Sciences to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</p>\\n<h2>Fees</h2>\\n<p>The following figures apply to the academic year 2013-2014. Students pay \\u20ac 7800 for 10 months Room &amp; Board service. Students from within the European Economic Area pay a tuition fee of \\u20ac 3500, Non-EEA students pay \\u20ac 8900. All students pay a contribution of \\u20ac 60 to the UCSA (University College Students Association).</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Official website University College Utrecht</li>\\n</ul>\"}]",

The design emphasizes the importance of a void, which opens a panorama towards the city skyline. It was open to the public in 1996.</p>\\n<h2>About the design</h2>\\n<p>The layout of the square is based on the expected use at different times of the day and its relationship to the sun. These sunlight-zones are reflected in the mosaic of the different materials used on the floor. The West side of the square is a poured epoxy floor containing silver leaves. The East side (with more sunlight) has a wooden bench over the entire length and warm materials including rubber and timber decking on the ground plane. <i>Pelargonium</i> geraniums are also placed seasonally within this warm zone.</p>\\n<p>Fifteen-meter high ventilation towers from the underground parking are strong vertical elements on the square. Each of these lightweight steel structures is activated with LED displays. Together the three towers form a digital clock. At night, the towers are lit from the inside spreading a soft filtered light. The centre of the square is finished with a deck of perforated metal panels and a wooden play area. The perforated metal panels are lit from below with white, green and black fluorescent tubes. Connections for electricity and water, as well as facilities to build tents and fencing for temporary events, are built into the floor.</p>\\n<p>Fluorescent lights form a radiant Milky Way at night. The whole square seems to be floating because of the linear lights that are mounted under the edge of the raised deck. The last major features of the square are the four hydraulic lighting elements. Their configuration can be interactively altered by the inhabitants of the city.</p>\\n<h2>Background</h2>\\n<p>Despite its prime location, the Theatre Square was formerly a dead urban space, infrequently used, and dilapidated. It was featureless byproduct of commercial development. This situation did not change until West 8 came to the square.</p>\\n<h2>External links and references</h2>\\n<ul><li>West 8 Urban Design and Landscape Architecture</li>\\n<li><i>Square dance - Schouwburgplein, Rotterdam, the Netherlands</i>, by Connie Van Cleef, Jan. 1998.</li>\\n<li>PAYSAGES (PDF file).</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\"},{\"dim\":10000,\"dist\":1418.9,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":10510,\"title\":\"Elvis Costello\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Elvis Costello</b> (born <b>Declan Patrick MacManus</b>, 25 August 1954) is an English singer-songwriter.

At the invitation of opera director Peter Sellars, he created video sequences to be shown as a backdrop to the action on stage during the performance of Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde. Using his trademark extreme slow motion, Viola's pieces used actors to portray the metaphorical story behind Wagner's story, seeing for example the first act as an extended ritual of purification in which the characters disrobe and wash themselves before finally plunging headlong into water together (in Wagner's story, the two characters maintain the facade of being indifferent to each other (necessary because Isolde is betrothed to Tristan's uncle) before, mistakenly believing they are going to die anyway, and reveal their true feelings). Viola trademarks such as fire and water are much in evidence here. The piece was first performed in Los Angeles at Disney Hall on 3 separate evenings in 2004, one act at a time, then given complete performances at the Bastille Opera in Paris in April and November 2005. The video pieces were later shown in London without Wagner's music in June to September 2006, at the Haunch of Venison Gallery and St Olave's College, London.

His half-siblings are Cornellia (born 13 February 1936), Antonia (born 22 August 1937) and Ferdinand (born 13 November 1944). Their father was still in Indonesia until Young was two years old. The family migrated to Western Australia and settled in the Perth Hills suburb of Kalamunda, in the early 1950s. Fokke worked as a welder on industrial projects including Kwinana Oil Refinery. His mother was in a choir and inspired his early interest in music.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Johnny_Young.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q6267945\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":69125,\"title\":\"Jan Timman\",\"text\":\"<p>By 1982 Timman was ranked second in the world, behind only Anatoly Karpov.

Starting as a dam constructed in 1270 on the Rotte River, Rotterdam has grown into a major international commercial centre. Its strategic location at the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta on the North Sea and at the heart of a massive rail, road, air and inland waterway distribution system extending throughout Europe is the reason that Rotterdam is often called the \\\"Gateway to Europe\\\".</p>\\n<p>Located in the province of South Holland, Rotterdam is in the west of Netherlands and the south of the Randstad. The population of the city was 619,879 in 2014. The population of the greater Rotterdam area, called \\\"Rotterdam-Rijnmond\\\" or just \\\"Rijnmond\\\", is approximately 1.3 million. The combined urban area of Rotterdam and The Hague with a population of approximately 2.9 million is the 206th largest urban area in the world and the most populous in the Netherlands. Rotterdam is known for its university (Erasmus), cutting-edge architecture, lively cultural life, striking riverside setting and maritime heritage. It is also known for the Rotterdam Blitz.</p>\\n<p>The largest port in Europe and one of the busiest ports in the world, the port of Rotterdam was the world's busiest port from 1962 to 2004, when it was surpassed by Shanghai. Rotterdam's commercial and strategic importance is based on its location near the mouth of the Nieuwe Maas (New Meuse), a channel in the delta formed by the Rhine and Meuse on the North Sea. These rivers lead directly into the centre of Europe, including the industrial Ruhr region.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>The settlement at the lower end of the fen stream <i>Rotte</i> (or <i>Rotta</i>, as it was then known, from <i>rot</i>, 'muddy' and <i>a</i>, 'water', thus 'muddy water') dates from at least 900 CE. Around <i>1150</i>, large floods in the area ended development, leading to the construction of protective dikes and dams, including <i>Schielands Hoge Zeedijk</i> ('Schieland\\u2019s High Sea Dike') along the northern banks of the present-day Nieuwe Maas. A dam on the Rotte or 'Rotterdam' was built in the 1260s and was located at the present-day <i>Hoogstraat</i> ('High Street').</p>\\n<p>On 7 July 1340, Count Willem IV of Holland granted city rights to Rotterdam, which then had approximately 2,000 inhabitants. Around the year 1350 a shipping canal, the <i>Rotterdamse Schie</i> was completed, which provided Rotterdam access to the larger towns in the north, allowing it to become a local trans-shipment centre between Holland, England and Germany, and to urbanize.</p>\\n\\n<p>The port of Rotterdam grew slowly but steadily into a port of importance, becoming the seat of one of the six 'chambers' of the <i>Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie</i> (VOC), the Dutch East India Company.</p>\\n<p>The greatest spurt of growth, both in port activity and population, followed the completion of the Nieuwe Waterweg in 1872. The city and harbor started to expand on the south bank of the river. The <i>Witte Huis</i> or <i>White House</i> skyscraper, inspired by American office buildings and built in 1898 in the French Chateau-style, is evidence of Rotterdam's rapid growth and success. When completed, it was the tallest office building in Europe, with a height of 45\\u00a0m (147.64\\u00a0ft).</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>During World War I the city was the world's largest spy centre because of Dutch neutrality and its location in between England, Germany and occupied Belgium.</p>\\n<p>During World War II, the German army invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. Adolf Hitler had hoped to conquer the country in just one day, but his forces met unexpectedly fierce resistance. The Dutch army was finally forced to capitulate on 15 May 1940, following Hitler's bombing Rotterdam on 14 May and threatening to bomb other Dutch cities. The heart of Rotterdam was almost completely destroyed by the Luftwaffe. 80,000 Civilians were made homeless and 900 were killed; a relatively low number because many had fled the city because of the warfare and bombing going on in Rotterdam since the start of the invasion three days earlier. The City Hall survived the bombing. Ossip Zadkine later attempted to capture the event with his statue <i>De Verwoeste Stad</i> ('The Destroyed City'). The statue stands near the <i>Leuvehaven</i>, not far from the Erasmusbrug in the centre of the city, on the north shore of the river <i>Nieuwe Maas</i>.</p>\\n<p>Rotterdam was gradually rebuilt from the 1950s through the 1970s. It remained quite windy and open until the city councils from the 1980s on began developing an active architectural policy. Daring and new styles of apartments, office buildings and recreation facilities resulted in a more 'livable' city centre with a new skyline. In the 1990s, the Kop van Zuid was built on the south bank of the river as a new business centre.</p>\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n\\n<p>'Rotterdam' is divided into a northern and a southern part by the river Nieuwe Maas, connected by (from west to east): the Beneluxtunnel; the Maastunnel; the <i>Erasmusbrug</i> ('Erasmus Bridge'); a subway tunnel; the <i>Willemsspoortunnel</i> ('Willems railway tunnel'); the <i>Willemsbrug</i> ('Willems Bridge'); the <i>Koninginnebrug</i> ('Queen's Bridge'); and the <i>Van Brienenoordbrug</i> ('Van Brienenoord Bridge'). The former railway lift bridge <i>De Hef</i> ('the Lift') is preserved as a monument in lifted position between the <i>Noordereiland</i> ('North Island') and the south of Rotterdam.</p>\\n<p>The city centre is located on the northern bank of the Nieuwe Maas, although recent urban development has extended the center to parts of southern Rotterdam known as <i>De Kop van Zuid</i> ('the Head of South', i.e. the northern part of southern Rotterdam). From its inland core, Rotterdam reaches the North Sea by a swathe of predominantly harbour area.</p>\\n<p>Built mostly behind dikes, large parts of the Rotterdam are below sea level. For instance, the Prins Alexander Polder in the northeast of Rotterdam extends 6 metres (20\\u00a0ft) below sea level, or rather below Normaal Amsterdams Peil (NAP) or 'Amsterdam Ordnance Datum'. The lowest point in the Netherlands (6.76 metres (22.2\\u00a0ft) below NAP) is situated just to the east of Rotterdam, in the municipality of Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Rotte river no longer joins the Nieuwe Maas directly. Since the early 1980s, when the construction of Rotterdam\\u2019s second subway line interfered with the Rotte\\u2019s course, its waters have been pumped through a pipe into the Nieuwe Maas via the Boerengat.</p>\\n\\n<p>Between the summers of 2003 and 2008 an artificial beach was created at the Boompjeskade along the Nieuwe Maas, between the Erasmus Bridge and the Willems Bridge. Swimming was not possible, digging pits was limited to the height of the layer of sand, about 50\\u00a0cm (20\\u00a0in). Alternatively people go the beach of Hoek van Holland (which is a Rotterdam district) or one of the beaches in Zeeland: Renesse or the Zuid Hollandse Eilanden: Ouddorp, Oostvoorne.</p>\\n<p>Rotterdam forms the centre of the Rijnmond conurbation, bordering the conurbation surrounding The Hague to the north-west. The two conurbations are close enough to be a single conurbation. They share the Rotterdam The Hague Airport and a light rail system called RandstadRail. Consideration is being given to creating an official Metropolitan region Rotterdam The Hague (<i>Metropoolregio Rotterdam Den Haag</i>), which would have a combined population approaching 2.5 million.</p>\\n<p>On its turn, the Rijnmond conurbation is part of the southern wing (the Zuidvleugel) of the Randstad, which is one of the most important economic and densely populated areas in the north-west of Europe. Having a population of 7.1 million, the Randstad is the sixth-largest metropolitan area in Europe (after Moscow, London, the Ruhr Area, Istanbul, and Paris). The Zuidvleugel, situated in the province of South Holland, has a population of around 3 million.</p>\\n<h3>Climate</h3>\\n<p>Rotterdam experiences a temperate oceanic climate (K\\u00f6ppen climate classification <i>Cfb</i>) similar to almost all of the Netherlands. With its location near the coast its climate is slightly milder than locations further inland.</p>\\n<h2>Demographics</h2>\\n<p>Overall the demographics differ per city area. According to a recent area analysis, the city centre has a singles population of 70%, between the ages of 20 and 40, considerably more than other city areas. Also the city centre has a much larger population of people with higher education and higher income. Nonetheless, 80% of the homes are rented, not owned. City centre also has a higher percentage (51% vs 45%) of foreign-born citizens (Dutch: allochtonen). The majority (70%) of shops are also run by foreign-born citizens.</p>\\n<h3>Composition</h3>\\n<p>On 1 January 2007 (source: Statistics Netherlands), the municipality covered an area of 319\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (206.44\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> of which is land) with a population of 603,425. It is part of a larger metropolitan area with a total population (including Dordrecht and surrounding cities) of approximately 1.6 million. In 1965, the municipal population of Rotterdam reached its peak of 731,000, but by 1984 it had decreased to 555,000 as a result of suburbanization.</p>\\n<p>Rotterdam consists of 14 submunicipalities: Centrum ('Center'), Charlois (including Heijplaat), Delfshaven, Feijenoord, Hillegersberg-Schiebroek, Hoek van Holland, Hoogvliet, IJsselmonde, Kralingen-Crooswijk, Noord, Overschie, Prins Alexander (the most populous submunicipality with around 85,000 inhabitants), and Rozenburg. One other area, Pernis, does have an official submunicipality status since 3 March 2010.</p>\\n<p>The current size of the municipality of Rotterdam is the result of the amalgamation of the following former municipalities, some of which now are a submunicipality:</p>\\n<ul><li>Delfshaven (added on 30 January 1886)</li>\\n<li>Charlois (added on 28 February 1895)</li>\\n<li>Kralingen (added on 28 February 1895)</li>\\n<li>Hoogvliet (added on 1 May 1934)</li>\\n<li>Pernis (added on 1 May 1934)</li>\\n<li>Hillegersberg (added on 1 August 1941)</li>\\n<li>IJsselmonde (added on 1 August 1941)</li>\\n<li>Overschie (added on 1 August 1941)</li>\\n<li>Schiebroek (added on 1 August 1941)</li>\\n<li>Rozenburg (added on 18 March 2010)</li>\\n</ul><h3>Ethnic make-up</h3>\\n<p>Figures are from 2011:</p>\\n<ul><li>Total: 610,386</li>\\n<li>Dutch: 319,265 (52.3%)</li>\\n<li>Surinamese: 51,885 (8.7%)</li>\\n<li>Turkish: 45,699 (7.8%)</li>\\n<li>Moroccan: 37,476 (6.5%)</li>\\n<li>Antillean / Aruban: 19,562 (3.6%)</li>\\n<li>Cape Verdean: 14.971 (3.4%)</li>\\n<li>Former Yugoslavs: 13,137 (3.1%)</li>\\n<li>Serbs: 7.000</li>\\n<li>Croats: 4.000</li>\\n<li>Bosniaks: 2.000</li>\\n<li>European immigrants: 67,371 (11.0%)</li>\\n<li>Other: 61,504 (10.1%)</li>\\n</ul><p>In the Netherlands, Rotterdam has the highest percentage of foreigners from non-industrialised nations. They form a large part of Rotterdam's multi ethnic and multicultural diversity. 47.7% of the population are of non Dutch origins or have at least one parent born outside the country. There are 80,000 Muslims, constituting 13% of the population. The mayor of Rotterdam, Ahmed Aboutaleb, is of Moroccan descent and is a practicing Muslim. The city is home to the largest Dutch Antillean community. The city also has its own China Town at the (West-) Kruiskade, close to the central railway station.</p>\\n<h2>Economy</h2>\\n\\n<p>Rotterdam has always been one of the main centers of the shipping industry in the Netherlands. From the Rotterdam Chamber of the VOC, the world's first multinational, established in 1602, to the merchant shipping leader Royal Nedlloyd established in 1970, with its corporate headquarters located in the landmark building the 'Willemswerf' in 1988. In 1997 Nedlloyd merged with the British shipping industry leader P&amp;O forming the third largest merchant shipping company in the world. The Anglo-Dutch P&amp;O Nedlloyd was bought by the Danish giant corporation 'AP Moller Maersk' in 2005 and its Dutch operations are still headquartered in the 'Willemswerf'. Rotterdam is also home to the Dutch half of the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever, and Mittal Steel Company N.V., subsidiary of Luxembourg-based Arcelor Mittal, the world's largest steel company.</p>\\n<p>The Erasmus University has a strong focus on research and education in management and economics. The University is located on the east side of the city and is surrounded by numerous multinational firms. On Brainpark I, Brainpark II, Brainpark III and <i>Het Rivium</i> are located offices of major multinationals. In the center of the city are the above-mentioned Unilever offices, but also Robeco, Fortis (including Mees Pierson and Stad Rotterdam Verzekeringen), ABN AMRO, ING (Nationale Nederlanden), the Rotterdam WTC, and the before mentioned Maersk Line who incorporates the Dutch merchant marine legacy.</p>\\n<p>The City of Rotterdam makes use of the services of semi-government companies Roteb (to take care of sanitation, waste management and assorted services) and the Port of Rotterdam Authority (to maintain the Port of Rotterdam). Both these companies were once municipal bodies, now they are autonomous entities, owned by the City.</p>\\n<p>Being the largest port and one of the largest cities of the country, Rotterdam attracts many seeking jobs, especially in the cheap labour segment. The city's unemployment rate is 8.5%, twice the national average.</p>\\n<p>Together with Eindhoven (Brainport) and Amsterdam (Airport), Rotterdam (Seaport) forms the foundation of the Dutch economy.</p>\\n<h3>Ports</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rotterdam has the largest port in Europe, with the rivers Meuse and Rhine providing excellent access to the hinterland upstream reaching to Basel, Switzerland and into France. In 2004 Shanghai took over as the world's busiest port. In 2006, Rotterdam was the world's seventh largest container port in terms of twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) handled.</p>\\n<p>The port's main activities are petrochemical industries and general cargo handling and transshipment. The harbour functions as an important transit point for bulk materials and between the European continent and overseas. From Rotterdam goods are transported by ship, river barge, train or road. In 2007, the <i>Betuweroute</i>, a new fast freight railway from Rotterdam to Germany, was completed.</p>\\n<p>In 1872, the Nieuwe Waterweg ('New Waterway') opened, a ship canal constructed to keep the city and port of Rotterdam accessible to seafaring vessels as the natural Meuse-Rhine channels silted up. The canal proper measures approximately 6.5 kilometres (4.0\\u00a0mi) from the western tips of its protruding dams to the Maeslantkering ('Maeslant Barrier'). Many maps, however, include the Scheur as part of the Nieuwe Waterweg, leading to a length of approximately 19.5 kilometres (12.1\\u00a0mi).</p>\\n<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, the port's center of gravity shifted westward towards the North Sea. Covering 105 square kilometres (41\\u00a0sq\\u00a0mi), the port of Rotterdam now stretches over a distance of 40 kilometres (25\\u00a0mi). It consists of the city center's historic harbor area, including Delfshaven; the Lloydkwartier; the Maashaven/Rijnhaven/Feijenoord complex; the harbors around Nieuw-Mathenesse; Waalhaven; Vondelingenplaat; Eemhaven; Botlek; Europoort, situated along the Calandkanaal, Nieuwe Waterweg and Scheur (the latter two being continuations of the Nieuwe Maas); and the reclaimed Maasvlakte area, which projects into the North Sea.</p>\\n<p>The construction of a second Maasvlakte received initial political approval in 2004, but was stopped by the Raad van State (the Dutch Council of State, which advises the government and parliament on legislation and governance) in 2005, because the plans did not take enough account of environmental issues. On 10 October 2006, however, approval was acquired to start construction in 2008, aiming for the first ship to anchor in 2013.</p>\\n<h3>Shopping</h3>\\n<p>Well-known streets in Rotterdam are the shopping center the Lijnbaan (the first set of pedestrian streets of the country, opened in 1953), the Hoogstraat, the Coolsingel with the city hall, and the Weena, which runs from the Central Station to the Hofplein (square). A modern shopping venue is the Beurstraverse (\\\"Stock Exchange Traverse\\\"), better known by its informal name 'Koopgoot' ('Buying/Shopping Gutter', after its subterranean position), which crosses the Coolsingel below street level).</p>\\n<p>The main shopping venue in the south of Rotterdam is Zuidplein, which lies close to Ahoy' Rotterdam, an accommodation center for shows, exhibitions, sporting events, concerts and congresses. Another prominent shopping center, called Alexandrium (sometimes still called by its former name <i>Oosterhof</i>), lies in the east of Rotterdam. It includes a large kitchen and furniture center.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>Rotterdam has one major university, the Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR), named after one of the city's famous former inhabitants, Desiderius Erasmus. The Woudestein campus houses (among others) Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University. In Financial Times' 2005 rankings it placed 29th globally and 7th in Europe. In the 2009 rankings of Masters of Management, the school reached first place with the CEMS Master in Management and a tenth place with its RSM Master in Management. The university is also home to Europe's largest student association, STAR Study Association Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University and the world's largest student association, AIESEC, has its international office in the city.</p>\\n<p>The Willem de Kooning Academy Rotterdam's main art school, which is part of the Hogeschool Rotterdam. It is regarded as one of the most prestigious art schools in the Netherlands and the number 1 in Advertising and Copywriting. Part of the Willem de Kooning Academy is the Piet Zwart Institute for postgraduate studies and research in Fine Art, Media Design and Retail Design. The Piet Zwart Institute boasts a selective roster of emerging international artists.</p>\\n<p>The Hoboken campus of EUR houses the Dijkzigt (general) hospital, the Sophia Hospital (for children) and the Medical Department of the University. These are known collectively as the Erasmus Medical Center, which is ranked third worldwide for medical research, behind the Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University. The Erasmus Medical Center ranks as the top European institution in clinical medicine according to the Times Higher Education rankings. As a combined medical treatment and research center it is particularly noted for its patient cohort studies in which large numbers of patients are followed for long periods of time.</p>\\n<p>There are also three <i>Hogescholen</i> (Universities of applied sciences) in Rotterdam. These schools award their students a professional Bachelor's degree and postgraduate or Master's degree. The three <i>Hogescholen</i> are Hogeschool Rotterdam, Hogeschool INHOLLAND and Hogeschool voor Muziek en Dans (uni for music and dance) which is also known as CodArts.</p>\\n<p>As there are many international and American schools scattered across Europe such as ASH (American International School of the Hague) Rotterdam also has its own international/American school by the name AISR (American International School of Rotterdam). At AISR children receive a multicultural education in a culturally diverse community and it offers the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program.</p>\\n<p>Unique to the city is the Shipping &amp; Transport College which offers masters, bachelors and vocational diplomas on all levels.</p>\\n<h2>Culture</h2>\\n\\n<p>Alongside Porto, Rotterdam was European Capital of Culture in 2001. The city has its own orchestra, the Rotterdam Philharmonic, with its well-regarded young music director Yannick N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin; a large congress and concert building called <i>De Doelen</i>; several theaters (including the new <i>Luxor</i>) and movie theatres; and the Ahoy Rotterdam complex in the south of the city, which is used for pop concerts, exhibitions, tennis tournaments, and other activities. A major zoo called Diergaarde Blijdorp is situated at the northwest side of Rotterdam, complete with a walkthrough sea aquarium called the Oceanium. The city is home to the Willem de Kooning Academy and Piet Zwart Institute.</p>\\n<p>Rotterdam is currently going through a sort of renaissance, with some urban architecture projects, a nightlife, and many summer festivals celebrating the city's multicultural population and identity, such as the Caribbean-inspired \\\"Summer Carnival\\\", the Dance Parade, Rotterdam 666, the Metropolis pop festival and the World Port days. In the years 2005-2011 the city struggled with venues for popmusic. Many of the venues suffered severe financial problems. This resulted in the disappearance of the major music venues Nighttown and WATT and smaller stages such as Waterfront, Exit, and Heidegger. Currently the city has a few venues for pop music like Rotown, Poortgebouw. The venue WORM focuses on experimental music and related cutting edge subcultural music. There are also the International Film Festival in January, the Poetry International Festival in June, the North Sea Jazz Festival in July, the Valery Gergiev Festival in September, September in Rotterdam and the World of the Witte de With. In June 1970, The Holland Pop Festival (which featured Jefferson Airplane, The Byrds, Canned Heat, It's a Beautiful Day, and Santana) was held and filmed at the Stamping Grounds in Rotterdam.</p>\\n<p>The self-image of the city is that of a no-nonsense workers' city. In that sense, there is a healthy competition with Amsterdam, which is often viewed as the cultural capital of the Netherlands. There is a saying: \\\"Amsterdam to party, Den Haag (The Hague) to live, Rotterdam to work\\\". Another one, more popular by Rotterdammers, is \\\"Money is earned in Rotterdam, distributed in The Hague and spent in Amsterdam\\\". Another saying that reflects both the rivalry between Rotterdam and Amsterdam is \\\"Amsterdam has it, Rotterdam doesn't need it\\\".</p>\\n<p>Rotterdam has had a rich hiphop music scene since the early 1980s. It is also the home of Gabber, a type of hardcore electronic music popular in the mid-1990s, with hard beats and samples. Groups like Neophyte and Rotterdam Terror Corps (RTC) started in Rotterdam.</p>\\n<p>The main cultural organisations in Amsterdam, such as the Concertgebouw and Holland Festival, have joint forces with similar organisations in Rotterdam, via A'R'dam. In 2007 these organisations published with plans for co-operation. One of the goals is to strengthen the international position of culture and art in the Netherlands in the international context.</p>\\n<h3>Museums</h3>\\n<p>Rotterdam has many museums. Well known museums are the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, the Netherlands Architecture Institute, the Wereldmuseum, the Kunsthal, Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art and the Maritime Museum Rotterdam. The <i>Historisch Museum</i> [1](Historical museum) has two buildings: the Dubbelde Palmboom and the Schielandshuis.</p>\\n<p>Other museums include the tax museum and the nature historical museum. At the historical shipyard and museum Scheepswerf 'De Delft' the reconstruction of ship of the line <i>Delft</i> can be visited.</p>\\n<h2>Architecture and skyline</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In 1898, the 45 meter high-rise office building the White House (in Dutch Witte Huis) was completed, at that time the tallest office building in Europe. In the first decades of the 20th century, some influential architecture in the modern style was built in Rotterdam. Notable are the Van Nelle fabriek (1929) a monument of modern factory design by Brinkman en Van der Vlugt, the Jugendstil clubhouse of the Royal Maas Yacht Club designed by Hooijkaas jr. en Brinkman (1909), and Feyenoord's football stadium De Kuip (1936) also by Brinkman en Van der Vlugt. The architect J. J. P. Oud was a famous Rotterdammer in those days. During the early stages of World War II the center of Rotterdam was bombed by the Germans, destroying many of the older buildings in the center of the city. After initial crisis re-construction the center of Rotterdam has become the site of ambitious new architecture.</p>\\n<p>Rotterdam is also famous for its Kubuswoningen or cube houses built by architect Piet Blom in 1984. In addition to that there are many international well known architects based in Rotterdam like O.M.A (Rem Koolhaas), MVRDV, Neutelings &amp; Riedijk and Erick van Egeraat to name a few.</p>\\n<p>Rotterdam houses several of the tallest structures in the Netherlands.</p>\\n<ul><li>The Erasmusbrug (1996) is a 790-meter (2,600\\u00a0ft) cable stayed bridge linking the north and south of Rotterdam. It is held up by a 138 metres (453\\u00a0ft) tall pylon with a characteristic bend, earning the bridge its nickname 'De Zwaan' ('the Swan').</li>\\n<li>Rotterdam has the tallest residential building in the Netherlands: the New Orleans Tower (158.35 metres (519.5\\u00a0ft)).</li>\\n<li>Rotterdam is also home to the tallest office building 'Maastoren' (164.75\\u00a0m or 540.5\\u00a0ft) which houses Deloitte. This office tower surpassed the 'Delftse Poort' (160\\u00a0m or 520\\u00a0ft) which houses Nationale-Nederlanden insurance company, part of ING Group as tallest office tower in 2009.</li>\\n<li>The city also houses the 186 metres (610\\u00a0ft) tall Euromast, which has long been a major tourist attraction. It was built in 1960, initially reaching a height of 101 metres (331\\u00a0ft); in 1970, the Euromast was extended by 85 metres (279\\u00a0ft) to its current height.</li>\\n</ul><p>Rotterdam has a reputation in being a platform for architectural development and education through the Berlage Institute, a postgraduate laboratory of architecture, and the NAi (Netherlands Architecture Institute), which is open to the public and has a variety of good exhibitions on architecture and urban planning issues.</p>\\n<p>Rotterdam is standing in the best European SkylineTop together with Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Paris, Warsaw and Moscow. Over 30 new highrise projects are being developed at the moment.</p>\\n<p>Highrise buildings that are currently being built:</p>\\n<ul><li>First Rotterdam, a large building with a height of 130 metres at Weena. It is expected to be completed in 2015.</li>\\n<li>Boston &amp; Seattle, two buildings with a height of 70 metres each are being built at Kop van Zuid. They are expected to be completed in 2017.</li>\\n</ul><p>Two architectural landmarks are located in the Lloydkwartier: the STC college building and the Schiecentrale 4b.</p>\\n<h2>Sports</h2>\\n<p>Rotterdam calls itself <i>Sportstad</i> (City of Sports). The city annually organises several world renowned sporting events. Some examples are the Rotterdam Marathon, the World Port Tournament, and the Rotterdam World Tennis Tournament. Rotterdam also organises one race of the Red Bull Air Race World Championship and the car racing event Monaco aan de Maas (Monaco at the Meuse).</p>\\n<p>The city is also the home of many sports clubs and some historic and iconic athletes.</p>\\n<h3>Football</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>Rotterdam is the home of three professional football clubs; two first tier clubs Feyenoord and Excelsior, and one second tier club Sparta.</p>\\n<p>Feyenoord, founded in 1908 and the dominant of the three professional clubs, has won fourteen national titles since the introduction of professional football in the Netherlands. It won the European Cup (current Champions league) as the first Dutch club in 1970, and won the World Cup for club teams in the same year. In 1974, they were the first Dutch club to win the UEFA Cup and in 2002, Feyenoord won the UEFA Cup again. In 2008, the year of their 100-year-anniversary, Feyenoord won the KNVB-cup.</p>\\n<p>Seating 51,480, its 1931 stadium, called <i>Stadion Feyenoord</i> but popularly known as De Kuip ('the Tub'), is the second largest in the country, after the Amsterdam ArenA. De Kuip, located in the southeast of the city, has hosted many international football games, including the final of Euro 2000 and has been awarded a FIFA 5 star ranking. There are concrete plans to build a new stadium with a capacity of at least 80,000 seats.</p>\\n<p>Sparta, founded in 1888 and situated in the northwest of Rotterdam, won the national title six times; Excelsior (founded 1902), in the northeast, has never won any.</p>\\n<p>Rotterdam also has three fourth tier clubs, SC Feijenoord (Feyenoord Amateurs), PVV DOTO and TOGR.

Rotterdam won the selection over the Dutch city of Utrecht. Germany's D\\u00fcsseldorf had previously also expressed interest in hosting. The Amaury Sport Organization (ASO), organizer of the Tour de France, said in a statement on its web site that it chose Rotterdam because, in addition to it being another big city, like London, to showcase the use of bikes for urban transportation, it provided a location well positioned considering the rest of the route envisioned for the 2010 event.</p>\\n<p>The start in Rotterdam was the fifth in the Netherlands. The prologue was a 7\\u00a0km (4.35\\u00a0mi) individual time trial crossing the centre of the city.

Students receive about seven hours of music lessons each week or fifteen hours of dance. It is a small school with an enrollment of about 200 students from across the country. The course prepares them for study at a conservatory or dance academy, but graduates must still pass entrance examinations to continue at the conservatory. Standard classroom subjects are taught using a fairly conservative or traditional approach, but exam results are above the national average. The school has two bridging classes - music and dance - and a bridging year.</p>\\n<p>The school organizes regular performances and shows so the students gain stage experience. For example, for two days in June 2010 the students put on the show <i>Talent On The Move 2010</i> at the Isala Theater, featuring choreography by Sara Erens, Ji\\u0159\\u00ed Kyli\\u00e1n, Adriaan Luteijn, Hans van Manen and Stuart Thom as well as original solos by the fifth year students.</p>\\n<h2>Facilities and staff</h2>\\n\\n<p>The Havo voor Muziek en Dans is co-located in the same modern building as Codarts, the Conservatory of Music and Dance Academy, and music and dance are taught by Codarts teachers. There are about 25 regular teachers and a large number of teachers from the Conservatory. The school is operated by the LMC Secondary Education Foundation, which operates several independent schools in the Rotterdam area. The school is unique in the Netherlands, with no competitors.</p>\\n<p>A formal review of the school in October 2005 found that the building had excellent facilities for dance and music training. The regular classrooms are rather cramped, but generally the school's accommodation is very good. The staff are cheerful and have considerable autonomy. Students are motivated and parents are involved. On a less positive note, the lack of competition is not conducive to improvements in quality. The relatively small, stable team of teachers is a positive factor, but gives little incentive for innovation, and the complex management structure involving LMC and Codarts sometimes causes delays in decision making.</p>\\n<h2>People</h2>\\n<p>The trumpeter John Floore served as director of the school between 1983 and 1997. Two former students received a Corrie Hartong scholarship for the 2011-2012 academic year, Joris Bergmans for an internship at Introdans in Arnhem and Christopher Renfurm at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in New York. In the documentary <i>De Droomfabriek</i> (the Dream Factory, 2006) Netty van Hoorn depicts the passion of the students and the teachers, as well as their daily lives. To make the documentary, van Hoorn and her cameraman Onno van der Wal visited the Academy intermittently over ten months and filmed pupils from a wide range of backgrounds.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Official website</li>\\n<li>Photograph of the building</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":1436.1,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":1858295,\"title\":\"Mirella Simoncini\",\"text\":\"<p>After leaving the radio and television scene, she became a balletteacher for Codarts Rotterdam Dance Academy, Rambert Dance Company, Danshuis Station Zuid and Danstraining Brabant.

It was established in its present location in 2000.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>Codarts can trace its origins to the Rotterdam Conservatorium voor Muziek (Rotterdam Conservatory of Music), popularly known as the Conservatorium Holthaus after its director, Jos Holthaus (1879-1943). In 1930 the alternative Rotterdamsch Toonkunst Conservatorium (Rotterdam Musical Arts Conservatory) was founded with the composer Willem Pijper as director. The Rotterdamse Dansschool (Rotterdam Dance School) was established in 1931 by Corrie Hartong as director and the German dancer Gertrud Leistikow as a teacher. At first the dance school was part of the Conservatorium Holthaus. In 1935 the dance school transferred to Pijper's conservatory. Hartong remained as director. She was to stay in this position until 1961, and continued to teach until 1967.</p>\\n<p>World War II broke out in 1939 and the Netherlands were invaded in May 1940. On 14 May 1940 the buildings of the dance school and the main building of Pijper's conservatory were destroyed by bombs. It was decided to merge Pijper's and Holthaus's conservatories into one building on Mathenesserlaan, where Holthaus had a branch. Soon they moved again to a big old house that had somehow been spared, totally surrounded by rubble, and managed to continue day classes and early evening classes before curfew throughout the remainder of the war. Until Holthaus died in 1943 the combined conservatory had two directors.</p>\\n<p>The Rotterdamse Dansschool was renamed the Rotterdamse Dansacademie (Rotterdam Dance Academy) in 1954. In 1986 the Conservatory and Dance Academy became the Hogeschool voor Muziek en Theater Rotterdam (Rotterdam University of Music and Theatre). The school moved into its present modern building next to the Doelen concert hall in 2000 under the name Codarts - hogeschool voor de kunsten (Codarts - University of the Arts). The Circus arts program was launched in September 2006.</p>\\n<h2>Schools</h2>\\n\\n<p>Codarts has three divisions: the Rotterdam Conservatory, Rotterdam Dance Academy, and Rotterdam Circus Arts.</p>\\n<p>The Rotterdam Conservatory is one of the largest conservatories in the Netherlands, with over 900 pupils. It offers courses through which students may obtain a bachelor's degree in any of several disciplines: Music Theater, Pop, Jazz, Composition/arranging, Music Production, Argentinean tango, Indian music, Flamenco, Latin/Latin jazz/Brazilian, Turkish music, Classical music, and Music in Education. The school puts on public performances, at times using the adjacent De Doelen concert hall. Thus in April 2011 guest conductor Arie van Beek led the Codarts Orchestra and Codarts Chamber Choir in a performance in the Jurriaanse Hall. In September 2011 the Codarts Ensemble performed a program that explored the boundary between classical music and jazz, with works by Stravinsky, Gershwin, Shostakovich, Antheil and Harvey. The Codarts Ensemble played again at De Doelen in March 2012 with the Codarts Chamber Choir, performing a major work by Arthur Honegger. They were conducted by Wiecher Mandemaker.</p>\\n<p>The Dance Academy teaches dancers and arranges for students to appear in performances and tours. Codarts helps students gain practical experience with internships with noted dance companies, and participates in student exchange programs with other European and American dance schools. In May 2011 the Rotterdam Dance Academy performed at the Venice Biennale with a show called <i>Talent on the Move</i>. The program included works by established choreographers such as Ji\\u0159\\u00ed Kyli\\u00e1n, Nacho Duato and Mauro Bigonzetti and by younger artists including graduates of the academy.</p>\\n<p>The Circus Arts school began offering a bachelor's course in September 2006, training students for careers in contemporary and traditional circus, in variety shows and in local or street theater. Circus students learn dance and drama as well as a wide range of circus techniques to prepare for a professional career.</p>\\n<p>The Havo voor Muziek en Dans (High School for Music and Dance) provides a secondary school education in which music and dance are part of the daily curriculum. It is co-located in the Codarts building and Codarts teachers teach the music and dance classes.  The school prepares students for higher music education, but graduates must still pass entrance examinations to continue at Codarts. The high school was the subject of the 2007 documentary <i>De Droomfabriek</i> (The Dream Factory) directed by Netty van Hoorn<i>.</i></p>\\n<h2>Building</h2>\\n<p>The building abuts the 1966 De Doelen concert and conference building, home of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra. It was built as part of an overall plan for an extension to De Doelen defined in 1993 by Jan Hoogstad. A new building site beside the Kruisplein was created by reducing the size of Karel Doormanstraat, and this was used for the Doelen extension and the Codarts building. The building was developed by the architectural firm of Ector Hoogstad, and was completed in 2000. The plinth is mainly used for commercial purposes. The building is relatively high to accommodate all the demands of the school, and has a total floor space of 10,500 square metres (113,000\\u00a0sq\\u00a0ft). Visually, the Codarts building appears to reach over the end of the conference center.</p>\\n<p>The building's steel skeleton supports a \\\"box in box\\\" design for the interior spaces, including several tall spaces with variable lighting. A long escalator connects the entrance lobby to the fifth floor. This is the main floor for Codarts, holding the restaurant, library and several performance rooms, and opening onto a terrace on the roof of the Doelen extension. Codarts occupies classrooms and offices below this floor. The conservatory is above it and the large dance studios are at the top of the building. The building is clad in brick to give an appearance consistent with nearby apartment buildings.</p>\\n<h2>Notable alumni</h2>\\n<ul><li>Henk van der Vliet (1950), Dutch composer and flautist</li>\\n<li>Willemijn Verkaik, Dutch theatre actress, best known for playing Elphaba from the musical Wicked in the Netherlands, Germany, New York and London.</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>\\\"Codarts Ensemble - Abel Marcel Calderon Arias/ Sin Despedida\\\".

It was built in 1879 and experienced a range of uses until it was squatted October 3, 1980. It had been standing empty for 2 years and was squatted as a protest intended to highlight the lack of affordable residential housing in Rotterdam.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The Poortgebouw was originally planned as one of two identical buildings separated by water and guarding the narrow entrance to the Binnenhaven, part of the original port of Rotterdam. It was intended to be the administrative headquarters of Rotterdamsche Handelsvereniging, but when the owner went bankrupt and fled to the United States of America the second building was not built. Later a smaller version was constructed, only to be demolished in 1937. When the Poortgebouw was squatted, the intention was to use the building as living space and a youth centre. After much negotiation with the city council, it was agreed in 1982 that the squatters could stay as a housing association (the <i>Vereniging Poortgebouw</i>). They would pay a low rent and undertook to maintain the inside of the building. The first rent contract was signed in May 1984. The Poortgebouw became home to a group of international artists, musicians and activists. Many grassroots, not-for-profit activities were held or planned at the Poortgebouw. It was used for music concerts (punk, ska, rock, acoustic), comedy nights, spoken word events, discussions and film nights.</p>\\n<h2>Location</h2>\\n<p>The address of the Poortgebouw is Stieltjesstraat 38, 3071 JX, Rotterdam.</p>\\n<h2>Activities</h2>\\n<p>Currently (2010) the Poortgebouw has a \\\"\\u00c9\\u00e9tcaf\\u00e9\\\" every Sunday evening (not in August) with vegetarian and sometimes vegan food. There are a free shop and a <i>voko</i> selling organic food at wholesale prices both of which are open to the public during the cafe from 18:00 - 21:00. There are regular open days, and also the Poortgebouw hosts occasional free concerts, discussions and film nights. Since July 2008 there is an infoshop called the Autonomous Library, which is open during the cafe and other events.</p>\\n<h2>Recent problems</h2>\\n<p>In July 2001 the Poortgebouw was sold by <i>Woning Bedrijf Rotterdam</i> (WBR), a semi-privatized company maintaining council-owned buildings, to <i>de Groene Groep</i>, a development company. The building was sold for 350,000 euro, which is approximately the price of a large single-family home. It was sold without the consultation of the Vereniging Poortgebouw (the Poortgebouw housing association). Since October 2004, the Vereniging Poortgebouw has been fighting in court the decision by de Groene Groep to cancel the rental contract, evict the tenants and renovate the Poortgebouw for office space. On February 17, 2006 the Rotterdam Court of Justice gave the verdict that the rental contract is ended and no alternative housing should be offered. The judge agreed with de Groene Groep that the only means to renovate the Poortgebouw building would be by redeveloping it as office space, supporting the contention of the developers that the outside of the building needs much work. The Vereniging Poortgebouw had argued that this work was needed because both Woning Bedrijf Rotterdam and de Groene Groep had neglected their contractual obligations to ensure the outside of the building was in a good condition. The Vereniging Poortgebouw has appealed this decision at a higher court in Den Haag and in 2010 that court judged that de Groene Groep was not permitted to evict the current tenants.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>Squatting</li>\\n<li>Social centre</li>\\n</ul><h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Poortgebouw official website</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":2045.7,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":37870500,\"title\":\"Igor de Vetyemy\",\"text\":\"<p>In 2010, de Vetyemy moved to The Netherlands, where he got married with the Dutch fashion designer Arno Smedinga.

The NAI was established in 1988 and has been based in Rotterdam since 1993.</p>\\n<p>The NAI is a private organisation with a government brief, which is to manage the collection of archives that document the history of Dutch architecture. Moreover, as a sector institute for architecture it is also tasked with supporting the professional field. The building also houses a bookshop and a cafe.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The idea of establishing a national architecture museum came about in 1912 when the Amsterdam architects\\u2019 association Architectura et Amicitia was obliged to rent an extra room in Hotel Parkzicht in Amsterdam to store its archive of drawings and models. Architect J.H.W. Leliman was a key advocate of an architecture museum. A committee comprising J. Ingenohl, J.H. de Groot and W.A.E. van der Pluym as members was set up to look into the possibilities of such a museum. In 1915, A et A members suggested storing the collection at the Rijksacademie in Amsterdam, and housing it in an independent museum at a later date. These ideas did not come to fruition, however.</p>\\n<p>In the 1980s, three cultural institutes collaborated to form the NAI. These were the Netherlands Architecture Documentation Centre (NDB), the Architecture Museum Foundation (SAM) and Stichting Wonen foundation. Following this, a controversy ensued between Amsterdam and Rotterdam as to where an architecture museum/institute would have to be based. Minister Brinkman opted for Rotterdam. Previous plans to set up the NAI in the vacant library at Botersloot were abandoned. The NAI found temporary accommodation in a building at Westersingel before the construction of a new building started.</p>\\n<h2>The building</h2>\\n<p>In 1988, a competition was held among six architects to find an architect for a new building. These were: Jo Coenen, Rem Koolhaas, Benthem Crouwel Architekten, Wim Quist, Luigi Snozzi and Ralph Erskine. Koolhaas\\u2019s design was the favourite among the specialist press and was also favoured by Riek Bakker, the director of Rotterdam\\u2019s Department of Urban Development. However, the NAI awarded Jo Coenen the commission, the decisive factors being the blending of the design into the surroundings and the references to the history of architecture.</p>\\n<p>After an intensive period of renovation, the NAI opened its doors on 1 July 2011. The most salient part of the renovation was moving the entrance to the pond level. The restaurant was extended. An exhibition room and additional space for educational activities were also added. At the site of the original entrance is now the DoeDek, a hands-on area where visitors can experiment with Lego, large blocks and cut-outs. As the original building\\u2019s architect, Jo Coenen was also responsible for its renovation.</p>\\n<h2>Sonneveld House Museum</h2>\\n<p>Sonneveld House Museum is a house built in the Nieuwe Bouwen style, the Dutch branch of the International School of Modernism. It was furnished with furniture and materials made by W.H. Gispen, B. van der Leck and others. The house was designed in 1933 by architects\\u2019 firm Brinkman and Van der Vlugt for the Sonneveld family. Albertus Sonneveld was one of the directors of the Van Nelle factory.</p>\\n<p>The Rotterdam Stichting Bevordering van Volkskracht (a foundation for the enhancement of popular health, welfare and culture in the city) bought the museum house in 1977. A form of collaboration has existed between Volkskracht and the NAI since February 1999. The house was restored and opened to the public in 2001. The restoration work was done by architects\\u2019 firm Molenaar &amp; Van Winden, with the NAI taking on the refurnishing work.</p>\\n<ul class=\\\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 1458px;_width: 1458px;\\\"><li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 235px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 235px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 235px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 235px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 235px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n</ul><h2>The collection</h2>\\n<p>Private individuals started collecting architectural archives as early as the end of the nineteenth century. One of these was the Architecture Museum Foundation (SAM). In the 1970s, the government became interested in these archives, setting up the Netherlands Architecture Documentation Centre (NDB) as part of the Rijksdienst voor de Monumentenzorg, the Netherlands Department for Conservation. When the archives were transferred to the NDB, they officially became state property. The NAI\\u2019s archive collection is still a national collection.</p>\\n<p>The libraries of the Academie van Bouwkunst Amsterdam (Amsterdam Academy of Architecture), the Bond van Nederlandse Architecten BNA (the Royal Institute of Dutch Architects) and Stichting Wonen, a consumer organisation for information on sustainable living, were added to the NDB\\u2019s collection. The collection now houses some 18 kilometres of archive material. It also contains over 500 archives and collections of Dutch architects, organisations and educational institutes in the field of architecture and urban development, and comprises drawings, sketches, models, documentation, correspondence and photos. The internationally focused library contains about 60,000 volumes.</p>\\n<p>The NAI houses the Stichting BONAS foundation, (Stichting Bibliografie\\u00ebn en Oeuvrelijsten Nederlandse Architecten en Stedebouwkundigen, which translates as Bibliographies and Lists of Works of Dutch Architects and Urban Designers). Working on the basis of archive and literature study, this organisation reconstructs the work of Dutch designers from 1790 to the present and publishes it in book form.</p>\\n<ul class=\\\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 1458px;_width: 1458px;\\\"><li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 235px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 235px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 235px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 235px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n</ul><h2>Exhibitions</h2>\\n<p>The NAI organises exhibitions about the designed environment: about architecture, urban development, design and spatial planning. These are some of the exhibitions that were held in recent years: Polders (2005), China Contemporary (2006), Wijdeveld: plan the impossible (2006), From Cuypers to Coenen (2007), Le Corbusier (2007), Shape our country (2009), Disputed City (2010) and Architecture of Consequence (2011). In addition to temporary exhibitions there are two (semi)permanent exhibitions: Stad van Nederland (Dutchville) and De Schatkamer (Treasury). Dutchville is about how the city is perceived and about its beautiful and slightly less appealing aspects. Opened in September 2011, the Treasury displays masterpieces from the collection in an exhibition space designed by Rem Koolhaas, which was opened in September 2011.</p>\\n<h2>Platform</h2>\\n<p>To promote its innovation agenda \\u2018Architecture of Consequence\\u2019, the NAI organises platform activities such as lectures and debates both in the Netherlands and abroad. What role can architecture play in solving social problems? This concerns topics such as food production, the social climate, renewable energy, alternative use of space, social cohesion and value creation. A \\u2018matchmaking\\u2019 programme brings together expertise on these subjects so as to find approaches to spatial tasks such as environmental issues or housing shortages. Studying and discussing these tasks puts them onto local and international agendas. The matchmaking programme focuses primarily on India and China.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n<p>The NAI offers programmes for primary and secondary education. It also works with various universities and universities of applied sciences on enhancing various subjects, study assignments, excursions and guided tours. Everyone can work hands-on on the DoeDek using large building blocks, Lego and cut-outs. Classes for children, supervised by architects and scientists, are to be held from February 2012.</p>\\n<h2>UAR (Urban Augmented Reality)</h2>\\n<p>The NAI introduced UAR on 30 June 2010. UAR is an acronym for Urban Augmented Reality. It is a free-of-charge 3D architecture application that uses Augmented reality. This means that a layer of information has been added to reality. In UAR, the existing, built environment is supplemented by a historical, a future or an alternative layer using 3D models. UAR shows us what is not there, what the city used to look like, by showing us buildings that have since disappeared. The city as it could have been, using models and drawings to display alternative designs that never made it. And the city as it will become, using artist\\u2019s impressions of future projects. The collections of various institutes and heritage organisations including the NAI\\u2019s own collection are used for this. UAR users can also add information to the application themselves. At present, UAR covers the cities of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Utrecht, The Hague, Breda, Haarlem and Gouda.</p>\\n<h2>NAiM | Bureau Europa</h2>\\n<p>On 2 September 2006, the NAI opened an annexe in Maastricht, in the Wiebengahal, which adjoins the Bonnefanten Museum, in the C\\u00e9ramique district. As of April 2009, this NAiM/Bureau Europa acquired independent status. Since 2013 the new name is Bureau Europa.</p>\\n<h2>NAI Publishers</h2>\\n<p>NAI Publishers originated from the NAI\\u2019s publication department but has been an independent company for 15 years now. The company specialises in publishing books on architecture, urban development, spatial planning, visual arts, photography and design. NAI Publishers\\u2019 bookshop was located in the NAI building. July 2012 NAI Publishers merged with 010 Publishers, a similar publisher, on a new location in Rotterdam. The name of the merger is nai010 publishers.</p>\\n<h2>Merger</h2>\\n<p>State Secretary Halbe Zijlstra designated the NAI as one of the organisations that were going to form the new institute for the Creative Industry on 1 January 2013. That date the NAI merged with Stichting Premsela, the Netherlands Institute for Design and Fashion (Design sector institute) and Virtueel Platform (E-culture knowledge institute). The name of the merger is <i>Het Nieuwe Instituut</i>, The New Institute.</p>\\n<h2>Board of Management and Supervisory Board</h2>\\n<p>The last management of the NAI comprised Ole Bouman (general director) and Peter Haasbroek (business director). The members of the Supervisory Board were: Hans Andersson (chairman), Karin Laglas (treasurer), Jeanne van Heeswijk, Leon Ramakers, Dirk Sijmons, Nathalie de Vries and Joop van der Leeuw.</p>\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Website Het Nieuwe Instituut, including NAI</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":2125.5,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":31190151,\"title\":\"Matthijs Huizing\",\"text\":\"<p>From 1980 to 1984 he was a member and also VVD fraction leader of the municipal council of the ward Kralingen-Crooswijk and from 2002 to 2008 and also till 2007 VVD fraction leader of the municipal council of Oegstgeest.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q2154693\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":31039255,\"title\":\"Mark Harbers\",\"text\":\"<p>Harbers was a member of the municipality of the ward Kralingen-Crooswijk (Rotterdam) from 1992 to 1998 and a member of the municipality of Rotterdam from 2002 to 2007.

The range of exhibitions presented at the Kunsthal ranges from 20th century masters to current contemporary art movements. Recently the museum had exhibitions featuring artists such as Chuck Close, Andy Warhol and Arne Quinze.</p>\\n<h2>Art theft</h2>\\n<p>On October 16, 2012, seven paintings were stolen from the museum.

At the time the museum was showing avant-garde art work by more than 150 artists from the Triton Foundation as part of their 20th anniversary celebrations. The robbery took place that morning at around 3:00 AM. Even though the alarms had gone off the thieves had left premises by the time police arrived. According to Rotterdam police, \\\"The alarm system in the Kunsthal is supposed to be state of the art. We've got no reason to believe that it's not but somehow the people responsible for this found a way in and a way out.\\\" Director of Art Loss Register suspects that the most valuable paintings were targeted and that they could be worth \\\"hundreds of millions of euros\\\" if legally sold at an auction. However, the paintings had been registered as stolen in their database.</p>\\n<p>Police have acknowledged the exceptional skill of the thieves.</p>\\n<p>The alleged thieves were arrested in Romania in July 2013. It is unclear what happened to the paintings: Olda Dogaru, whose son, Radu, has confessed to his involvement in the theft, initially claimed that she had burned them all in an effort to protect him; however, she subsequently denied this in a court hearing. However, investigators found pigments and nails of the correct age for the stolen paintings in her fireplace.</p>\\n<ul class=\\\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\\\"><li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"gallerybox\\\" style=\\\"width: 155px\\\">\\n\\n</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Official website</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":2270.3,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":44040718,\"title\":\"Kees Moeliker\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Cornelis W.

The privilege to found a Latin school was granted to the town of Rotterdam before Rotterdam received full city rights and therefore the school predates the birth of the city itself by nearly twenty years. It was renamed in 1842, after the famous Rotterdam theologian and humanist Desiderius Erasmus (1466\\u20131536). The school is more than a century older than its namesake, and it is unclear whether he attended it.</p>\\n<p>The school was located at the corner of the Coolsingel and the Laurensstraat until 1937, nowadays C&amp;A, a clothing store, is located at that place, and the school at the Wytemaweg. In May 1940, Rotterdam was heavily bombed by the German aggressor, but the school building survived miraculously. During the war, the occupying German troops used the building as one of their headquarters.</p>\\n<h2>Profile</h2>\\n<p>In the Netherlands, there are several levels of secondary education, the highest being the vwo, pre-university secondary education. In the past decades, many schools have merged with schools of higher or lower levels to form wide-scope community schools. Some gymnasiums, such as the Gymnasium Erasmianum are among the few remaining high-level-only schools, and has managed to avoid merging because of its high number of students. Another special property of Gymnasia is that they offer compulsory classes in the ancient languages Latin and Ancient Greek.</p>\\n<p>The school is widely known for its great number of foreign students. There are more foreign students at the Gymnasium Erasmianum than at any other Gymnasium in the Netherlands.</p>\\n<p>The school serves 1,045 students and 80 teachers. The school's motto is \\\"Ex Pluribus Unum\\\", meaning \\\"unity through diversity\\\".</p>\\n<h2>Notable people</h2>\\n<h3>Teachers</h3>\\n<ul><li>J. H. Leopold, Dutch poet</li>\\n<li>H.B.G.

In addition to individual members, seventy national Esperanto organizations are affiliated with UEA. Its current president is the Canadian professor Mark Fettes.</p>\\n<p>UEA was founded in 1908 by the Swiss journalist Hector Hodler and others, and is now headquartered in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The organization has an office at the United Nations building in New York City.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Structure and affiliated organizations</h2>\\n\\n<p>According to its 1980 statutes (Statuto de UEA), the World Esperanto Association has two kinds of members:</p>\\n<ul><li>individual members join the association directly, paying a fee to the Rotterdam headquarters or to the chief delegate in their country. These members receive the UEA Yearbook and receive the UEA services.</li>\\n<li><i>asociaj membroj</i>, those members of the organizations that joined UEA. These members are administered by their respective organizations. It can be a national or a specialist organization. This kind of membership is for the person in question a mere symbolical membership.</li>\\n</ul><p>The highest organ of UEA, the Komitato, has members (<i>komitatanoj</i>) elected in three different ways:</p>\\n<ul><li>An organization sends one <i>komitatano</i> for every 1,000 national members to the Komitato, but at least one. Most national organizations have only one <i>komitatano</i>.</li>\\n<li>Per 1,000 individual members, the individual members can choose one member to the Komitato.</li>\\n<li>Both previous groups by-elect more <i>komitatanoj</i>, up to one third of their numbers.</li>\\n</ul><p>The Komitato elects a board, the <i>Estraro</i>. The <i>Estraro</i> installs a general director and sometimes additionally a director. The general director and his staff work at the UEA headquarters, <i>Oficejo de UEA</i>, in Rotterdam.</p>\\n<p>An individual member can become a <i>delegito</i>, a 'delegate'. This means that he serves as a local contact person for Esperanto and UEA members in his town. A <i>\\u0109efdelegito</i> (chief delegate) is someone installed also by the UEA headquarters, but with the task to collect the member fees in a given country.</p>\\n<h3>Youth section</h3>\\n<p>TEJO, the World Esperanto Youth Organization, is the youth section of the UEA. Similar to the World Congress, TEJO organizes an International Youth Congress of Esperanto (<i>Internacia Junulara Kongreso</i>) each year in a different location. The IJK is a week-long event of concerts, presentations, excursions attended by hundreds of young people from all over the world.</p>\\n<p>The youth section has a Komitato and national and specialist affiliated organizations, just as UEA itself. A TEJO volunteer works at the Rotterdam headquarters.</p>\\n<h3>National organizations</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>The first national Esperanto organization was founded in 1898 in France, originally as a potential international association. In 1903 followed the second one, in Switzerland. Within a couple of years, many of the now still existing national organizations came into existence. Since 1933/1934 they send representatives into the UEA Komitato (a kind of parliament), making it a federation of national organizations. The term in Esperanto was initially mostly <i>Naciaj Societoj</i> (national societies), since 1933 <i>Landaj Asocioj</i> (country associations).</p>\\n<p>When UEA accepted national organizations in 1933/1934 for the first time, it required them to</p>\\n<ul><li>have at least 100 national members,</li>\\n<li>be 'organized in an orderly manner',</li>\\n<li>be neutral, meaning having no political or religious aims, and being open to all citizens of the country.</li>\\n</ul><p>Especially the last prerequisite caused serious problems, e.g. to the German national association coming in those months under national socialist rule. Later, for example, the Cuban association was refused because its statutes claimed to respect the leading role of the communist party in Cuba. In 1980, the UEA statutes were altered. Since then, a national organization need not be neutral itself, but must respect the neutrality of UEA.</p>\\n<h3>Specialist organizations</h3>\\n<p>Specialist organizations are similar to the national organizations. They are divided into two groups:</p>\\n<ul><li>neutral organizations, that can join UEA in the same way as a national organizations. In Esperanto they are called <i>ali\\u011dintaj fakaj asocioj</i> (affiliated specialist associations). Examples are the Esperanto physicians and the Esperanto teachers.</li>\\n<li>other organizations in (official) collaboration with UEA. They do not send representatives to the Komitato but are mentioned in the Yearbook and can have a room at the World Congress. Some of them refuse to be affiliated because of financial reasons, others because they are non-neutral and cannot join UEA. Examples are the Esperanto vegetarians, the Esperanto Catholics and the Esperanto communists.</li>\\n</ul><p>The youth section TEJO has two affiliated specialist groups, the cyclists and the lovers of rock music.</p>\\n<h2>Activities</h2>\\n<h3>Publications</h3>\\n<p>UEA is the publisher of <i>Esperanto</i>, the most important Esperanto periodical. It was started in 1905 by Paul Berthelot, three years before UEA was founded. UEA founder Hector Hodler took it over in 1907 and made it the official UEA magazine in 1908. In 1920 he left the magazine to the association. Since the 1950s it has a paid editor-in-chief.</p>\\n<p>Next to <i>Esperanto</i>, the Yearbook (Jarlibro de UEA) is the oldest continuous publication of the association.</p>\\n\\n<p>UEA publishes books and has the largest mail-order Esperanto bookstore in the world (with over 6000 books, CDs and other items). It also maintains an information center and an important Esperanto library, called the Hector Hodler Library. The organisation has a network of local representatives from around the world, the <i>Delegita Reto</i>, who are available to provide information about their geographical area or professional field.</p>\\n<h3>Conventions</h3>\\n<p>The yearly World Congress of Esperanto (<i>Universala Kongreso de Esperanto</i>), which attracts 1500\\u20133000 people to a different city each year, is held under the direction of UEA. The first congress took place in 1905, and since 1933/1934 the association is in charge of it.</p>\\n<p>Twice a year, in spring and autumn, UEA headquarters in Rotterdam holds an Open Day.</p>\\n<h3>International organizations</h3>\\n<p>In addition to the UN and UNESCO, UEA also has consultative relations with UNICEF and the Council of Europe, and a general working relationship with the Organization of American States. It works in an official capacity with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an A-liaison to ISO/TC37. UEA is active in public information in the European Union and as necessary at other interstate and international organizations and conferences. The organisation is a member of the European Language Council, a common forum of universities and language associations for the awareness of languages and cultures inside and outside the European Union.</p>\\n<p>In May 2011, UEA officially became an Associate Member of the International Information Centre for Terminology (Infoterm).</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>The founding years of the Esperanto movement, 1888-1914</h3>\\n<p>Modern UEA is the result of a decades lasting process of several attempts to give the Esperanto movement a proper organization. The first Esperanto associations were local clubs, of which the one in Nuremberg, Germany, is considered the first (1888). From 1898, national Esperanto associations were found in several countries, with the French one being the first. In 1903 followed the Swiss association, in 1904 the British, in 1906 the German and Swedish etc.</p>\\n<p>The founder of Esperanto, L. L. Zamenhof, wished that an international association came to existence, but the first world congress of 1905 produced only a general manifesto about the essence (and neutrality) of the movement. The organizing team passed the torch to organizers of a next congress the year after, this created eventually a <i>Konstanta Kongresa Komitato</i> (Permanent Congress Committee). It consisted of two members representing the last congress, two for the current and two for the following congress.</p>\\n<p>The esperantists agreed that the whole movement must support two common international tasks: international documentation, propaganda in countries without smovement of their own, lobbying at international organizations, organizing the world congresses, etc. The Esperantists did disagree on which or what organization should be responsible for these tasks, how it should collect the money and how it should decide on spending the money.</p>\\n<p>In 1906, the French general Hyppolyte Sebert created his <i>Esperantista Centra Oficejo</i> (Central Office of the Esperantists) in Paris. It collected information on the movement and published an <i>Oficiala Gazeto</i>. In spite of this 'official' name, the office was a purely private enterprise of Sebert, but he tried to reach support from the national associations.</p>\\n<p>One year later, at the Geneva world congress, Zamenhof created a <i>Lingva Komitato</i> (Language Committee, the basis of the later Akademio de Esperanto). It consisted of some eminent speakers from several countries and had to guard the evolution of the language Esperanto. The members of this committee were consequently elected by cooptation.</p>\\n\\n<p>In 1908, a group of young Esperanto speakers around Hector Hodler founded an international association based on individual, direct membership: <i>Universala Esperanto-Asocio</i>, seated in Geneva. According to Hodler and his followers, an international cause such as Esperanto must be supported by a unitary, truly international association. UEA members should found organizations on national and local levels.</p>\\n<p>The national (and local) associations saw UEA as a threat, as an undesirable concurrence. They were afraid of a division in the movement between the traditional groups on the one hand and the UEA members on the other. Also, propaganda and lessons were the task of the national associations (often federations of local groups). They did not like the perspective that new Esperantists, created by the traditional groups, would be picked up by UEA.</p>\\n<p>So the national associations tried to build up an international organizational level by their own. A first attempt were the <i>rajtigitaj delegitoj</i> of the congresses in 1911 and 1912 (not to be confused with the UEA <i>delegitoj</i>); an <i>Internacia Unui\\u011do de Esperantistaj Societoj</i> (International Union of Esperanto associations, 1913/1914) was a second attempt. This string in the evolution ceased in 1914 with the breakout of World War I, which forced the movement as a whole to pause many of its activities.</p>\\n<h3>UEA in its first years</h3>\\n<p>The original UEA was purely based on individual membership. The members in a given locality, e.g. a town, were supposed to have UEA member conventions and elect a <i>delegito</i> (plural <i>delegitoj</i>), a delegate. The delegate had the task to collect the member fees and send them to the Geneva headquarters, and he represented his members on the international level. The totality of delegates held referenda, and they elected the Komitato (committee), the highest organ of the association.</p>\\n<p>The Komitato was a board with initially eight (since 1910: ten) members. It had a president and a vice president. One of the board members was the director, from 1908 to 1920 this was Hector Hodler. The director was the one who installed delegates in towns where there were less than 20 members. These were 94 percent of the delegates, so in certain way UEA was not so much a democracy but ruled by a circular co-option. (Since 1920, the Komitato became larger and a kind of parliament, and a board with the name <i>Estraro</i> was established.)</p>\\n<p>Hodler was still the owner and publisher of his magazine <i>Esperanto</i>, published every second week. From the beginning, UEA had a Yearbook - Jarlibro - with basic information about the association and with the addresses of the delegates.</p>\\n<p>Esperanto speakers are divided by different subjects they are interested in. In those early years, there came some specialist organizations into existence, for example the <i>Universala Medicina Esperanto-Asocio</i> of 1908. Hodler tried to give those 'specialists' a home in his UEA. Instead of founding associations of their own, with separate bulletins and conventions, he wanted them to be UEA members and have 'fakoj' (compartments). He also thought of partner organizations, for example hotels who would give a discount to UEA members in change for an advertisement in the UEA Yearbook.</p>\\n<p>Hodler projected an organization fit to contain ten thousands or hundreds of thousands of members, the so-called <i>esperantianoj</i> (UEA members, in opposition to the simple <i>esperantistoj</i>, Esperanto speakers). In fact, UEA had never more than 10,000 members. The association adopted several new statutes until 1920.</p>\\n<h3>Attempts of organization in the interbellum, 1920-1933</h3>\\n\\n<p>In 1920, the Esperanto movement gathered again since the war, at the Hague congress. The discussions eventually created the so-called Helsinki system, on which UEA and the national associations agreed at the congress of 1922 in the Finnish capital. This system defined the movement to consist of these 'official' entities:</p>\\n<ul><li><i>Universala Esperanto Asocio</i> (UEA), the international members' association in Geneva; it paid contributions to a common budget</li>\\n<li><i>Konstanta Komitato de la Naciaj Societoj</i> (Ko-Ro, Permanent Committee of the National Associations), a newly created organ to represent the national associations; it collected contributions from the national associations for the common budget</li>\\n<li><i>Internacia Centra Komitato de la Esperanto-Movado</i> (ICK, International Central Committee of the Esperanto Movement), a newly created organ elected by UEA and Ko-Ro together; administering the common budget and doing the operational business for the international common tasks, also representing the movement as a whole. It consisted of six persons and had a paid secretary.</li>\\n<li>the congress committee, administered and subsidized by the ICK</li>\\n<li>the language committee (later the Academy of Esperanto), subsidized by the ICK</li>\\n</ul><p>This Helsinki system lasted for only a couple of years. The heads of the movement saw that on the world congresses three organs gathered discussing essentially the same subjects: the <i>Komitato</i> of UEA, the Ko-Ro of the national associations and the six members of the ICK. From 1929, they all had a joint gathering called <i>\\u011cenerala Estraro</i> (general board). A number of proprosals came up in the movement to reform the organization.</p>\\n<p>But the final blow to the Helsinki system came in 1932 when UEA did not pay its contributions for the common budget, and the same was true for some of the national associations. The British, German and French associations, the largest ones, took up the initiative to found a new organization, <i>Universala Federacio Esperantista</i> (World Federation of Esperantists), as a federation of national associations. This new organization came hardly into existence, because in early 1933 UEA and the national organizations agreed on a complete reform of the movement.</p>\\n<h3>The 'new UEA' and the schism of 1936</h3>\\n<p>In 1933, at the Cologne congress, UEA and the national organizations made UEA the common or umbrella organization of the international Esperanto movement. In 1934 the UEA members accepted new UEA statutes. The 'new UEA', as it was called, was (and still is) a federation of national associations but also of individual members directly administered by UEA.</p>\\n<p>Highest organ of UEA was the Komitato. It gathered representatives from the national organizations, the numbers depended on the size of the national organization. Other representatives were elected by the delegates, depending on the number of delegates. A third group of representatives was elected by the two first groups, this opened the possibility to include 'experts' who were not linked to a national organization or popular among the delegates. Since 1947, one speaks of the <i>komitatanoj A</i> (from the national organizations), the <i>komitatanoj B</i> (from the delegates, later members) and the <i>komitatanoj C</i> (those by-elected).</p>\\n\\n<p>As the representatives of the national organizations by far outnumbered the others, it is right to call UEA in essence a federation. But all office holders of UEA had to be individual members, and the core services of the association such as the Yearbook were still reserved to the individual members.</p>\\n<p>UEA since then is the legal heir of the former Helsinki organizations, such as the International Central Committee. The association since then is also organizing the annual World Congress of Esperanto.</p>\\n<p>Although in 1933/1934 it first seemed that the transition could happen in harmony, at the 1934 congress in Stockholm some UEA functionaries were not re-elected. In anger, UEA president Eduard Stettler and others resigned. The new board with president Louis Bastien faced a very difficult, if not catastrophal financial situation and decided in early 1936 to leave Geneva for London. In London, the capable activist Cecil C. Goldsmith wanted to become the new director (secretary), and for certain currency reasons UEA could exist significantly more cheaply in Britain than in Switzerland.</p>\\n<p>Suddenly, a campaign secretly led by Stettler made it the Bastien board impossible to legally move the headquarters away from Switzerland. After discussions taking several months and a referendum, the Bastien board members and the Komitato members left UEA and erected in September 1936 a new association, the <i>Internacia Esperanto-Ligo</i> (IEL). Nearly all national organizations and individual members followed. In Geneva stayed a deserted UEA, in which the old leaders took power again, the so-called Genevan UEA.</p>\\n<h3>UEA after World War II</h3>\\n<p>The international Esperanto movement survived World War II with its IEL headquarters in Heronsgate, a small place in the vicinity of London. Hans Jakob from the Genevan UEA tricked the IEL board into a fusion of IEL and Genevan UEA, lying that the rich Eduard Stettler had left a huge capital to UEA.</p>\\n<p>Ivo Lapenna, a London law professor originally coming from Croatia, in the 1950s reshaped the association significantly. The office moved from Heronsgate to Rotterdam, the board since then has a <i>general secretary</i>, the <i>Esperanto</i> editor is a paid position. After 1956, the association in 1980 was again (and since then for the last time) given new statutes.</p>\\n<p>The decades after the war brought with them a notable growth of the staff. After having had usually a director and one, two employees to support him, UEA at times employed ten people or more, among them e.g. a congress manager, a book seller, a librarian.</p>\\n<p>Lapenna introduced a <i>prestige policy</i>, for which he was willing to spend considerable funds. This included signature campaigns for Esperanto and efforts to make Unesco support Esperanto in a moral way, which Lapenna accomplished in 1954 at the Unesco conference in Montevideo, Uruguay. This made him famous in the Esperanto circles as the <i>hero of Montevideo</i>. After having served for more than thirty years on the UEA board, Lapenna left the association in 1974 and created a rival organization (<i>Ne\\u016dtrala Esperanto-Movado</i>).</p>\\n<p>During the Cold War, UEA had to deal with the difficulty of having national organizations and individual members in communist countries. Also the Esperanto work in Western countries was sometimes influenced by the Cold War: in the early 50s, the American Esperanto leader George Allan Connor denounced dissenting members of his national organization as communists. His national organization and he as an individual were finally thrown out of UEA. The collapse of the Soviet Union and allied states between 1989 and 1991 completely changed the international situation.</p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>TEJO (World Esperanto Youth Organization)</li>\\n<li>Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda, the leftist global Esperanto organization</li>\\n<li>World Congress of Esperanto</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n<ol class=\\\"references\\\"><li id=\\\"cite_note-1\\\"><b>^</b> Sikosek, Marcus: <i>Die neutrale Sprache.

Erasmus for centuries has enjoyed popularity in academia, being a person who should always be remembered by Rotterdam.<br>\\nErasmus University Rotterdam has been among the best in all kinds of world rankings. In 2007, Erasmus University Rotterdam ranked top ten of the top universities in Europe by \\\" Financial Times \\\".

The University describes its principal tasks as: \\\"... the generation and transfer of knowledge proceeding from a high degree of social engagement. To this end, the university pursues knowledge in an enquiring, critical, investigative and flexible manner, with a strong international orientation and based on the values of professionalism, teamwork and fair play.\\\"</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>Erasmus University Rotterdam has existed in its present form since 1973. Its history, however, dates back to 1913, the year in which the <b>Netherlands School of Commerce</b> (Nederlandsche Handels-Hoogeschool or NHH) was founded through private initiative with broad support from the Rotterdam business community. The statutory recognition of higher education in commerce and economics as an academic discipline resulted in 1939 in a change of name. The NHH became the NEH or <b>Netherlands School of Economics</b> (Nederlandse Economische Hogeschool). The growing complexity of society led in the 1960s to the arrival of the faculties of Law and Social Sciences, followed in later decades by Philosophy, History and Arts, and Business Administration.</p>\\n<p>From 1950, the Foundation for Higher Clinical Education used its best efforts to get a full academic medical study programme established in Rotterdam, and with success: In 1966, the government established the Medical Faculty Rotterdam, housed next to Dijkzigt Hospital. Together with the Sophia Children's Hospital and the Daniel den Hoed Clinic, it forms the University Hospital Rotterdam, which as of 1 January 2003 bears the name Erasmus MC. In 1973, the Medical Faculty Rotterdam and the Netherlands School of Economics merged to become Erasmus University Rotterdam \\u2013 the first university in the Netherlands named after a person, a man to whom Rotterdam owes the reputation it has held for centuries in the academic world.</p>\\n<h2>University structure</h2>\\n<p>Erasmus University Rotterdam has bundled its education and research in four areas of expertise in which the university has a national and international reputation to maintain:</p>\\n<ul><li><b>Health</b>\\n<ul><li>Erasmus MC</li>\\n<li>Institute of Health Policy and Management</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li><b>Wealth</b>\\n<ul><li>Erasmus School of Economics</li>\\n<li>Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li><b>Governance</b>\\n<ul><li>Erasmus School of Law</li>\\n<li>Faculty of Social Sciences</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li><b>Culture</b>\\n<ul><li>Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication</li>\\n<li>Faculty of Social Sciences</li>\\n<li>Faculty of Philosophy</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n</ul><h3>Health</h3>\\n<p>This domain includes the Erasmus MC and the Institute of Health Policy and Management (iBMG).</p>\\n<p>Erasmus MC is the new name for the university medical centre in Rotterdam, which is a merger of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and the University Hospital Rotterdam (Dijkzigt, Sophia, Daniel den Hoed clinic).

IHS was founded in 1958. It offers post graduate education and training, advisory services and applied research in the field of urban management, housing and urban planning.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1958 Jan van Ettinger Snr., managing director of the Rotterdam-based Bouwcentrum  that had been set up to rebuild Rotterdam after the war, established the first International Course on Building (ICB). The objective was to acquaint planners, engineers and architects from developing countries with systematic methods to meet building requirements. In June 1972 ICB's educational activities were transferred to Bouwcentrum International Education (BIE), which remained located in the <i>round building</i> in the heart of Rotterdam. In addition to the standard course available, more and more specialised courses were added to the teaching programme, aimed at mid-career professionals.</p>\\n<p>In 1982 the BIE changed its name to the Institute for Housing Studies (IHS). The institute redesigned its courses to promote the development of skills to solve problems in their local context. In 1990 the name changed once more to the Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies, but the acronym IHS remained. At the same time the institute began linking its short courses to a new Master's programme entitled Urban Management. This programme was a collaboration with the Economic Faculty of the Erasmus University Rotterdam and was later replaced by the present Master's Urban Management and Development (UMD). The Master's programme was re-designed as a one-year Master's degree with six specializations.</p>\\n<p>During the 90s activities overseas intensified. Longer-term institutional development programmes were fostered. IHS established or strengthened more than a dozen international institutions abroad for training, research, and capacity-building. There was also a significant increase in projects involving multilateral and bilateral organizations, including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. Cooperation with UN-HABITAT and its various programmes brought the parties involved especially close.</p>\\n<p>In January 2000 IHS moved premises to a new building on the Woudestein Campus of the Erasmus University Rotterdam. Its activities were reorganized - as they are today - around research, training and education, and advisory services. Both the Municipality of Rotterdam (through the former Rotterdam Development Corporation) and the Erasmus University Rotterdam became stakeholders. Then in 2004, IHS became an independent limited company as part of the EUR Holding BV. Since June 2010 the director of IHS is Kees van Rooijen.</p>\\n<p>Today, IHS develops human and institutional capacities to reduce poverty and improve the standard of living in cities around the world. IHS has over 8,000 alumni in more than 140 countries.</p>\\n<h2>Education at IHS</h2>\\n<p>IHS offers a range of post-graduate programmes from post-graduate certificate and diploma programmes to Master's degree programmes. But also short courses, for example on Housing Policies and Finance, Land Management and Informal Settlement Regularisation (in cooperation with the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy) and Climate Change. In recent years IHS has offered tailor-made training programmes combining in-country modules and modules in Rotterdam for organisations in South Africa, Cuba, Albania, Brazil, Argentina, Uganda, Indonesia, China, and Yemen.</p>\\n<h2>Publications</h2>\\n<p>The IHS publishes three series, the Working Paper Seriesin Urban Management, the IHS Project Papers Series and the IHS Thesis Series. The IHS Thesis Series was set up in 2006 as a new publication. Working Papers are preliminary scientific papers and pre-publication versions of academic articles and book chapters. The IHS Project Paper Series allows staff involved in advisory projects to publish project outputs. This series aims to highlight key experiences from projects and innovative methods used on work executed. With the IHS Thesis Series the objective is to publish the best theses of the Master Programme in Urban Management and Development (UMD). The abstracts of the theses are also placed on the IHS website and the full text of the theses are available through the EUR\\u2019s Institutional Repository: RePub (see http://repub.eur.nl).</p>\\n<h2>Achievements</h2>\\n<p>IHS was selected as the winner for the 2007 UN-Habitat Scroll of Honour Award \\\"for leading the way as a global center of excellence and knowledge through its high quality training programmes in housing, urban management and urban environmental management and planning.\\\"</p>\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>website IHS</li>\\n<li>website Erasmus University Rotterdam</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<p></p>\"},{\"dim\":400,\"dist\":2900.9,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":27381106,\"title\":\"Adolph Cornelis van Bruggen\",\"text\":\"<p>&#8216;Dear Dolf, it is time to return to Holland and to educate the students here with the many insights you have learnt in Africa.&#8217; That was essentially the message that Prof. Dr Van der Vecht, chairing Systematic Zoology at Leiden University, sent to Dolf in the beginning of 1966.

The original zoo had been heavily damaged in a bombing two days prior to the Blitz but it had not been touched by the main bombardment on May 10, 1940. Some streetnames, such as Diergaardesingel (<i>Zoolane</i>), still recall the old zoo. <i>Blijdorp</i> was rebuilt slightly to the north, where it opened to the public in its current location on December 7, 1940. The new zoo was designed by Dutch architect Sybold van Ravesteyn, who designed the central railway station in Rotterdam, as well. In 2001, Blijdorp became almost twice as large when it opened a new western part, which includes the aquarium <i>Oceanium</i>. In 2007, the zoo was declared a rijksmonument.</p>\\n<p>In May 2007 the zoo appeared in the news when Bokito, Blijdorp's silverback gorilla, escaped from his enclosure and seriously injured a female visitor. Before the attack, the woman was a regular visitor of the zoo (on average 4 times per week) and claimed to have a special bond with Bokito, regularly touching the glass between her and the gorilla, making eye contact and smiling to him.</p>\\n<p>In October 2010, the city of Rotterdam decided to reduce its yearly funding of Blijdorp from nearly 4.5 to about 0.8 million Euro until 2015. The zoo and its supporters protested the decision, claiming it is unclear if the zoo can continue to operate with the reduced budget.</p>\\n<p>In March of 2014, the zoo made headlines when a zoo worker in the giraffe exhibit dying of terminal brain cancer was taken to the exhibit and was licked by one of the giraffes he had worked with; the video went viral worldwide quickly.</p>\\n<h2>Breeding programs</h2>\\n\\n<p>Diergaarde Blijdorp participates in about 70 breeding programs and studbooks, and coordinates a number of these, including the international breeding program for Red Pandas, EEPs for Asian Elephant, Komodo Dragon, Red-crowned and Siberian Crane, Visayan Warty Pig and Egyptian Tortoise, and the ESB for the Crowned Pigeons.</p>\\n<h2>Botanical garden</h2>\\n<p>Blijdorp also houses a botanical garden and manages both the Dutch National Bromelia Collection and the Dutch National <i>Primula</i> Collection.</p>\\n<h2>Oceanium</h2>\\n\\n<p>The Oceanium is an aquarium that opened in the zoo in 2001. The Oceanium lies in the expansion area of the zoo, which includes a new entrance and parking area, and was the biggest project to date for the zoo. The area around the Oceanium is home to projects depicting the Americas.</p>\\n<h2>Animal list</h2>\\n<h3>Asia</h3>\\n<p><b>Chinese garden</b></p>\\n<ul><li>Tufted Deer (<i>Elaphodus
