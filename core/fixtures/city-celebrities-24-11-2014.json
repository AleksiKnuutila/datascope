It borders on Stoke Newington to the west and Shacklewell to the south. Although part of Clapton, as a distinct area, it can be said to be bounded by Amhurst Road to the south, Kenninghall Road to the north, Cricketfield Road to the east and the railway to the west, thus occupying most of the western half of Lower Clapton and some of the shrinking district of Shacklewell. The streets north and south of the park are dominated by social housing \\u2013 these areas were largely rebuilt during the 1930s and 1960s.</p>\\n<p>The Downs open space was originally common land, preserved from the 1860s as parkland as a result of pressure by the Commons Preservation Society. At 16 hectares (40 acres), the park is one of the larger open spaces wholly within the London Borough of Hackney. It has a play area, basketball courts, football pitches and a bowling green.</p>\\n<p>Occupying, as it does, a fairly central place in Hackney, the park used to be the yearly venue for the popular Hackney Show, but this event \\u2014 which helped to give a sense of community and identity to an often-troubled borough \\u2014 has been discontinued in recent times as a cost-cutting measure, as have the regular Fireworks Night shows.

On its transfer to the London County Council in 1906 the school was renamed Hackney Downs School (formerly the Grocers' Company's School).</p>\\n<h3>Grammar school</h3>\\n<p>As a grammar school, it won an excellent reputation, with alumni including Nobel prize-winning playwright the late Harold Pinter, fellow playwright and actor Steven Berkoff, 1960s tycoon John Bloom, and athletics administrator Sir Arthur Gold. Many famous medical men attended including kidney transplant pioneer Ralph Shackman and pioneering nutritionist John Yudkin. Four current members of the House of Lords are former pupils: (Lord Levy, Baron Peston, Lord Feldman, and Lord Clinton-Davis). It had 600 boys with a sixth-form entry by the early 1970s.</p>\\n<h3>Comprehensive</h3>\\n<p>In September 1974, it became a comprehensive school, and inherited more than its share of the problems of this deprived inner-city borough. It had voted to become comprehensive in 1969. Just before its closure, over 70 percent of the boys spoke English as a second language, half came from households with no-one in employment, and half the intake had reading ages three years below average.</p>\\n<h3>Decline and closure</h3>\\n<p>Things came to a head in the 1990s, when the school made national news by being described by the then Conservative government as the 'worst school in Britain'. Eventually, as a result of direct government pressure, the school was forced to close in 1995.</p>\\n<p>The decision remains controversial to this day, opponents of the closure pointing out that Hackney Downs was singled out for special treatment by the government (presumably <i>pour encourager les autres</i>) and that its academic results were not significantly worse than many other inner-city comprehensives, especially considering the problems it had inherited, including the steady 'decanting' of problem pupils\\u2014who had frequently been expelled from their original schools\\u2014to Hackney Downs.</p>\\n<h3>Later use of the building</h3>\\n<p>The site of the old school is now occupied by Mossbourne Community Academy, founded by Sir Clive Bourne, which opened in 2004.</p>\\n<p>While the school buildings of both the original Grocers' Company's School and Hackney Downs School have been replaced by the new Mossbourne Academy, the Old Boys of Hackney Downs continue their interactions as alumni through The Clove Club, which meets regularly, has its own website, and sponsors a very active email group called <i>The Clove eGroup</i> (on Yahoo), and featured on The Clove Club website.</p>\\n<h3>Histories of the School</h3>\\n<p>An official history of the school, written by the historian Professor Geoffrey Alderman (who was a pupil there 1955-62) was published by the Clove Club in 1972. In 2012 Alderman published an updated history: <i>Hackney Downs 1876-1995: The Life and Death of a School,</i> in which he took the story to the school's demise, using hitherto unpublished material.</p>\\n<h3>Headmasters</h3>\\n<ul><li>John Kemp 1974-89</li>\\n</ul><h2>Notable alumni</h2>\\n<h3>Hackney Downs School (1974-95)</h3>\\n<ul><li>Dalton Grant, high jumper</li>\\n</ul><h3>Boys' grammar school (1906-74)</h3>\\n<ul><li>Geoffrey Alderman, historian</li>\\n<li>Arnold Allen CBE, Chief Executive from 1982-4 of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)</li>\\n<li>Alexander Baron, writer</li>\\n<li>Morris Beckman</li>\\n<li>Steven Berkoff, actor, playwright, director</li>\\n<li>Prof Gerald Bernbaum, Vice-Chancellor from 1993-2001 of London South Bank University, and Professor of Education from 1974-93 at the University of Leicester</li>\\n<li>John Bloom, 1960s tycoon</li>\\n<li>Eric Bristow, World Champion darts player</li>\\n<li>Air Vice-Marshal Reggie Bullen CB GM</li>\\n<li>Sir Stanley Burnton, Lord Justice of Appeal and Fellow of St Edmund Hall, Oxford</li>\\n<li>Sir Michael Caine (Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, Jr.), CBE, actor (attended in 1944-1945, when he was evacuated to King's Lynn during World War II)</li>\\n<li>Roland Camberton, writer</li>\\n<li>Frank Cass, publisher</li>\\n<li>Stanley Clinton Davis, Baron Clinton-Davis, Labour MP from 1970-83 for Hackney Central</li>\\n<li>Ivor Compton, founder of the Hall of Cards chain which later merged with Hallmark Cards</li>\\n<li>Dr Paul Dean CB, Director from 1977-90 of the National Physical Laboratory</li>\\n<li>Prof Cyril Domb, physicist, Professor of Theoretical Physics from 1954-81 at King's College London</li>\\n<li>Maurice Evans (actor)</li>\\n<li>Basil Feldman, Baron Feldman</li>\\n<li>Frederic Sutherland Ferguson, bibliographer</li>\\n<li>Prof Maurice Freedman, Professor of Social Anthropology from 1970-5 at the University of Oxford</li>\\n<li>Abram Games OBE, graphic designer</li>\\n<li>Norman Ginsbury, playwright</li>\\n<li>Sir Arthur Gold CBE, Chairman from 1988-92 of the British Olympic Association</li>\\n<li>Dr Michael Goldstein CBE, Vice-Chancellor from 1992-2004 of Coventry University, and Director from 1987-1992 of Coventry Polytechnic</li>\\n<li>Arnold Goodman, Baron Goodman, Master from 1976-86 of University College, Oxford</li>\\n<li>Prof Douglas Gough, Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics since 1993 at the University of Cambridge, and Director from 1999-2004 of the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge</li>\\n<li>Prof Abraham Guz, Professor of Medicine from 1981-94 at the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School</li>\\n<li>Efraim Halevy, former head of Mossad</li>\\n<li>Prof William Harold Hutt, economist, and Professor of Commerce and Dean of the Faculty of Commerce from 1931-64 at the University of Cape Town</li>\\n<li>Frank Cyril James, Principal and Vice-Chancellor from 1939-62 of McGill University, Canada</li>\\n<li>Brigadier Sam Janikoun OBE</li>\\n<li>Maj-Gen Stanley Joslin CB CBE, Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations from 1959-64 at the Ministry of Power</li>\\n<li>Leon Kossoff, painter</li>\\n<li>Stephen Latner, Managing Director from 1998-9 of Warburg Dillon Read</li>\\n<li>Dr Gerald Levene, dermatologist</li>\\n<li>Michael Levy, Baron Levy</li>\\n<li>John Lewis, Labour MP from 1945-50 for Bolton and from 1950-1 for Bolton West</li>\\n<li>Sir Ben Lockspeiser, cancelled the ground-breaking Miles M.52 supersonic project (its important features later re-incarnated as the Bell X-1), and first President of CERN</li>\\n<li>Dennis Lyons CB, Director from 1965-71 of the Road Research Laboratory</li>\\n<li>Sir Leonard Millis CBE, Director from 1939-74 of the British Waterworks Association</li>\\n<li>Prof Cyril Offord, Professor of Mathematics from 1966-73 at the London School of Economics (LSE)</li>\\n<li>Stamley Orman, Director of Missiles from 1978-81 at the AWRE, and Chief Weapon System Engineer of Polaris from 1981-2</li>\\n<li>Fuller Osborn, (the first) Chief Executive from 1965-78 of Northern Rock Building Society</li>\\n<li>Jerry Pam, Hollywood Agent and Member of the Finance Committee of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences; publicist of Sir Michael Caine</li>\\n<li>Prof Keith Pavitt, of the Science and Technology Policy Research</li>\\n<li>Maurice Peston, Baron Peston of Mile End, English economist, Professor of Economics from 1965-88 at Queen Mary College, and father of Robert Peston</li>\\n<li>Harold Pinter, CBE, CH, and 2005 Nobel Laureate (attended from 1944 to 1948; evacuated to Cornwall during World War II)</li>\\n<li>Lt Col F.

The parish church of St John-at-Hackney was built in 1789, replacing the nearby former 16th-century parish church dedicated to St Augustine (pulled down in 1798). The original tower of that church was retained to hold the bells until the new church could be strengthened; the bells were finally removed to the new St John's in 1854. See details of other, more modern, churches within the original parish boundaries below.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Ancient parish</h2>\\n<p>The vestry of the parish, in common with all parishes in England, was entrusted with various administrative functions from the 17th century. The parish vestry administered the Poor Law until 1837, until it became part of the Poor Law Union of Hackney. The ecclesiastical and civil roles of the parish increasingly diverged, and by the early nineteenth century they covered different areas.</p>\\n<h2>Civil parish</h2>\\n<p>A distinct civil parish dates from 1855, with the incorporation of <i>The Vestry of the Parish of Hackney in the County of Middlesex</i> by section 42 of the Metropolis Management Act. With Stoke Newington it formed part of the Hackney District, governed by the Hackney District Board of Works, within the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works. In 1894, the district and board were dissolved, with the Hackney vestry taking on its duties within the parish.</p>\\n<p>In 1889 Hackney was included in the new County of London, and in 1900 the vestry was dissolved with the parish becoming the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney. The civil parish was abolished when the borough became part of the London Borough of Hackney in 1965.</p>\\n<p>The boundaries of the civil parish were identical to the ancient parish, and it covered 3,289 acres (13.3\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>).

Its area became part of the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Formation and boundaries</h2>\\n<p>The borough was one of twenty-eight metropolitan boroughs created by the London Government Act 1899. It was the successor to the vestry of the parish of Hackney, which had been the local authority since 1855.</p>\\n<p>The boundaries of Hackney with the neighbouring boroughs were adjusted slightly in 1900: Hackney gained the east side of Bethune Road from Stoke Newington and the south side of Balls Pond Road from Islington; it lost the west side of Southgate Road to Islington. The boundary with Shoreditch was altered to run along the Regents Canal, Albion Road and Brougham Road, while the boundary with Bethnal Green, which had formed a straight line, was changed to follow the line of Gore Road. A further adjustment was made in 1908, when areas were exchanged with Tottenham Urban District, Middlesex. It had a border with Leyton Urban District (a municipal borough from 1926) in Essex to the east and to the north, from which it was divided by Hackney Marshes.</p>\\n<p>The metropolitan borough included the districts of Hackney, Upper and Lower Clapton, Homerton, Dalston and Kingsland. It also included Stoke Newington Common, and the entire eastern side of Stoke Newington High Street.</p>\\n<h2>Population and area</h2>\\n<p>The metropolitan borough was almost coterminous with the ancient parish of Hackney. Statistics were compiled by the London County Council in 1901 to show population growth in London over the preceding century.</p>\\n<p>The area of the borough in 1901 was 3,289 acres (13.3\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>). The populations recorded in National Censuses were:</p>\\n<p><b>Hackney St John's Civil Parish 1801\\u20131899</b></p>\\n<p><b>Metropolitan Borough 1900\\u20131961</b></p>\\n<p>By comparison, after amalgamation with Shoreditch and Stoke Newington, to form the modern London Borough of Hackney, the combined area became 19.06\\u00a0km\\u00b2 - approximately 4,710 acres (19.1\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>); in 2005, this had a population of 207,700, or a population density of 10,900/km\\u00b2. In 1901 Hackney the population density was 16,475/km\\u00b2.</p>\\n<h2>Borough council</h2>\\n<h3>Elections</h3>\\n<p>The Hackney Vestry was controlled by the Progressive Party, the grouping linked with the parliamentary Liberal Party. Opposition on the body was provided by the Conservative-backed Moderate Party. The vestry had 119 members, with one third elected annually. The parish was divided into eight wards for elections.</p>\\n<p>The London Government Act 1899 replaced the incorporated vestries with borough councils consisting of a mayor, aldermen and councillors. All councillors were to be elected every three years. There was one alderman for every six councillors, and these were elected by the council itself.</p>\\n<p>Boundary commissioners were appointed under the London Government Act 1899 to divide the new boroughs into wards, and to apportion councillors to each ward. It was decided to continue to use the eight vestry wards. The Moderates claimed that Stamford Hill and West Hackney wards were under-represented and should be given nine councillors, with the remaining six wards having six each. In the event, the commissioners apportioned 60 councillors between the eight wards: Clapton Park, Hackney, Homerton and Stamford Hill having nine councillors and Downs, Kingsland, South and West wards having six a piece. With 10 aldermen, the borough council thus had 70 members.</p>\\n<h4>1900\\u20131919</h4>\\n<p>The boundary changes seem to have favoured the Moderates, as at the first elections to the council on 1 November 1900 they won a majority with 37 seats to 18 won by the Liberal Party and Progressives, with 3 independent Conservative and 2 independent councillors also returned. At the next election in 1903 the Progressives won control with 49 seats to 11 Conservatives. Three years later the Conservatives ran under the Municipal Reform label. Municipal Reformers won 18 seats and independents supported by them won 20, giving them a majority over the Progressives with 22 seats. The Progressives regained the council in 1909 with a narrow majority, losing power to the Municipal Reform party again in 1912.</p>\\n<h4>1919\\u20131937</h4>\\n<p>The next elections, postponed until 1919 due to the First World War, were won by the Labour Party: Labour won 32 seats, Municipal Reform 15 and Progressives 13. At the next elections in 1922 a \\\"Progressive Reform\\\" anti-Labour alliance won all seats on the council, and held them at the subsequent polls in 1925. The 1928 election was partly run on party lines: the Municipal Reform party won control with 31 seats, other Anti-Labour candidates won 15, Labour won 12 and Progressives 1. In 1931 Municipal Reformers won all but one seat, which was held by Labour. Labour gained control of the borough council in 1934, and held power for the rest of the borough's existence. In 1934 they won 45 seats to 15 won by Municipal Reformers.</p>\\n<h4>1937\\u20131965</h4>\\n<p>In 1937 the borough's ward boundaries were redrawn: sixteen wards were created (Chatham, Culford, Dalston, Downs, Graham, Leaside, Marsh, Maury, Park, Ridley, Southwold, Springfield, Stamford, Town Hall, Tudor and Wick), each represented by three councillors. To the forty-eight councillors thus elected were added 8 aldermen. Labour won 41 seats in 1937 to Municipal Reform's 7. Local elections were postponed due to the Second World War, and from 1945 the only non-Labour councillors were Communists: 1 was elected in 1945, and 2 in 1949. At the last four elections to the council in 1953, 1956, 1959 and 1962 Labour won all the seats.</p>\\n<h3>Coat of arms</h3>\\n<p>The seal of the Hackney Vestry bore a representation of St Augustine's Tower, the remains of the 13th-century parish church. When the metropolitan borough was formed in 1900, the vestry seal was altered by the addition of the Latin motto <i>Justitia Turris Nostra</i> or <i>Justice is our tower</i>.</p>\\n<p>In January 1924 the borough council resolved to seek a formal grant of armorial bearings from the College of Arms. These were duly made by letters patent dated 31 May 1924. The arms were blazoned as follows:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Per fesse, the chief per pale gules and per fesse Sable and Argent, and the base barry wavy of six Argent and Azure, in the dexter chief a representation of the Hackney Tower proper and in the sinister chief a Maltese Cross per fesse Argent and Gules.<br>\\nCrest: On a Wreath of the Colours a representation of the Hackney Tower Or.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The \\\"Hackney Tower\\\" appeared in the upper portion of the shield, and formed the crest, placed on a helm and mantling. The 1900 motto was also retained. The Maltese Cross represented the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller. These orders successively held the manor of Hackney, until the Reformation. The Templars wore red crosses on white mantles, and the Hospitallers white crosses on black: these were combined in the design. The wavy white and blue bars at the base of the shield represented the River Lea and the many canals crossing the borough.</p>\\n<p>These arms gave much inspiration to the coat of arms of the London Borough of Hackney when the London borough was created in 1965.</p>\\n<h3>Town hall</h3>\\n\\n<p>The borough council was initially based in a \\\"French-Italian\\\" style town hall in Hackney Grove, dating from 1866. The building was extended in 1898. A new Art Deco town hall in Mare Street was begun in 1934, and opened in 1937. It is now the headquarters of the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<p><br clear=\\\"all\\\"></p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>London Government Act 1899</li>\\n<li>Metropolis Management Act 1855</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\\n<ul><li>Robert Donald, ed.

Following this successful campaign Cruddas was appointed Conservative Party co-treasurer in June 2011.[5] In January 2012 he was elevated to Treasurer of the Conservative Party, a main board member and a member of the Conservative Party Finance and Audit Committee.</p>\\n<p>In March 2012 on its front page story it was alleged by The Sunday Times that Cruddas had offered access to the Prime Minister David Cameron and the Chancellor George Osborne, in exchange for cash donations of between \\u00a3100,000 and \\u00a3250,000.[6][7] Cruddas resigned the same day.[8] The story was billed as \\u201ccash for access\\u201d In July 2013, Cruddas successfully sued the Sunday Times and its two journalists Heidi Blake and Jonathan Calvert for libel and malicious falsehood http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_falsehood over its coverage of him, which the High Court found had been defamatory. http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2013/2298.html&amp;query=cruddas&amp;method=boolean.[9] Following his victory Cruddas\\u2019s lawyers (Slater Gordon) commented \\u201cCruddas v Calvert, Blake and Times Newspapers is the most significant libel case of 2013 and one of the most significant libel cases of the last decade. http://www.slatergordon.co.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2013/07/peter-cruddas-wins-his-libel-and-malicious-falsehood-trial-against-sunday-times/</p>\\n<p>The award of \\u00a3180,000 in damages to Mr Cruddas (including \\u00a315,000 for aggravated damages) and his legal costs of \\u00a31million is one of the highest libel awards in recent years and it reflects both the seriousness of the allegations and the damage and distress they caused to Mr Cruddas.</p>\\n<p>The Sunday Times defended the action by maintaining that the articles it published were true. However, Mr Justice Tugendhat rejected the defence and castigated the journalists (Blake and Calvert) for being malicious - they knew that the articles were false, they had a dominant intention to injure Mr Cruddas and they expressed delight when learning that they had caused his resignation. The High Court and Court of Appeal both refused to grant the Defendants permission to appeal.</p>\\n<p>Following Mr Cruddas\\u2019 victory against the Sunday Times, Prime Minister David Cameron, made a public apology to him for the way he had been treated by the Conservative Party in the aftermath of the Sunday Times story. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/i-owe-outcast-peter-cruddas-an-apology-admits-david-cameron-8750049.html</p>\\n<p>In the wake of the original newspaper report Mr Cameron gave a speech condemning Mr Cruddas's alleged actions as \\\"completely unacceptable and wrong\\\". High Court judge Mr Justice Tugendhat criticised Mr Cameron's response, saying he had subjected his former colleague to a \\\"massive public humiliation\\\". \\\"The Prime Minister did not know what Mr Cruddas had said. All he knew was what the Sunday Times had reported,\\\" said the judge in his finding. Mr Cameron said he was \\\"very sorry\\\" about the treatment of Mr Cruddas, who claimed he was \\\"cut off\\\" by the party and \\\"made to feel like an outcast\\\" by the Prime Minister. \\\"I rather think I do owe him an apology,\\\" he admitted. \\\"Had I known at the time how badly the journalists had behaved, I might have been in the position to take a different approach. \\\"I am very sorry about that. I congratulate Peter Cruddas on his victory and on the verdict he has won. I think it is very deserved. \\\"He [Cruddas] has done a huge amount for this country. I look forward to meeting him after the summer.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In January 2014 Cruddas became a board member of Business for Britain, the campaign group for reform in Europe. http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/peter-cruddas-joins-business-britain-group-lobby-eu-reform-1432046.

It is protected by Acts of Parliament as a London Square. It is dominated by the Church of St John-at-Hackney built in 1792-97, and St John\\u2019s Gardens. Its made up of listed late Georgian terraces on Clapton Square. More of these terraces can be found on the south side of Sutton Place (once home to Colin Firth) and pairs of early mid-nineteenth-century houses to the north.</p>\\n<p>Clapton Square has a charming village feel, and five-storey houses with their original leaded fanlights above the doors, pilasters and roof cornicing. Their sash windows, ornamental cast-iron balconies, six panelled doors, columns and porches make them easily as impressive as any Grade II listed Georgian property in smarter south-west London, and many have stunning views of the church. Clapton Square, with its ivy-clad frontages, was laid out on Clapton Field in 1816 and is still a pocket of greenery in this busy area. Two sides of the square were demolished in the late 19th century, so today Georgian houses are only on the north and west sides. The Rectory for St Johns was relocated to Clapton Square in 2006.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Square was laid out in 1816 by wealthy citizens such as brokers from the city in the style of West End Georgian squares and terraces. It has central gardens containing a finely restored drinking fountain donated to Hackney residents by Howard Morley Esq.in 1894. The east side of the square was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War but has now been rebuilt in Georgian style by Furlong Homes. Russian revolutionary Vladimir Illyich Lenin used to visit, around 1905, his friend and comrade Theodore Rothstein at a house on the west side. 19th century Jewish writer Grace Aguilar also lived in the Square. To the north-east of the square is Holly Villas in Clapton Passage which is a fine terrace of bay-windowed Victorian villas of 1882.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\u2018On the whole I spent my life more happily at Hackney than I had ever done before\\u2019 wrote Joseph Priestley one of England\\u2019s greatest scientists who lived at a house in the 1790s (demolished in 1880) on the corner of the Passage and Lower Clapton Road. He was hounded out of his house and laboratory in Birmingham by a mob that opposed his support for the French Revolution. He was invited to come to Hackney to take up the post of Unitarian Minister at the Old Gravel Pit Chapel where he had many friends amongst the Hackney Dissenters. A plaque marks the site of his house above the existing corner building in Lower Clapton Road. He emigrated to America in 1794 fearing a repeat of his family\\u2019s persecution.</p>\\n<p>In a cottage behind Priestley\\u2019s house, in the closing years of the 18th century, lived a Huguenot widow called Louisa Perina Courtauld, a designer of gold plate who married Samuel Courtauld (goldsmith). Their son, Samuel Courtauld, founded the Courtauld dynasty of silk and artificial fibre manufacturers and a descendant founded the Courtauld Institute now in Somerset House.</p>\\n\\n<p>Clapton Square is situated near the centre of the London Borough of Hackney, at the junction of the historic north-south thoroughfares of Lower Clapton Road and Mare Street and the east-west route of Dalston Lane and Homerton High Street (Figure 1). The land slopes gently down from the north to the southern portion of the Conservation Area. Most of the Area is situated on the Hackney Gravels geological terrace created by the once wider River Thames. The Conservation Area is split amongst Chatham, Dalston, East Down and Lea Bridge Wards, and has approximately 250 dwellings yielding a population of some 1,000 people.</p>\\n<p>The Conservation Area contains two significant open spaces, Clapton Square and the Churchyard of St. John-at-Hackney, known as St. John's Gardens, an L-shaped green area with good footpaths. The serpentine form of Lower Clapton Road (together with the partly pedestrianised stretch of Mare Street, a busy shopping district) is a distinctive feature of the Area, generating a good sequence of views.</p>\\n\\n<p>The plague in 1665 and the Great Fire of London the following year did a great deal to make country life more appealing to affluent urbanites and this trend continued in the Georgian period. Daniel Defoe, who lived in Stoke Newington, described Hackney in the 1720s as comprising \\\"twelve hamlets\\\" and \\\"having so many rich citizens that it contained nearly a hundred coaches\\\". Important Hackney residents included the Governor of the Bank of England, who lived in Hackney House, Clapton in 1745 and the chief founder of the Honourable East India Company.</p>\\n\\n<p>Georgian streets have a uniformity, due to the regulations of the London Building Act of 1774. Known as the Black Act because of its impositions, it was passed in response to the Great Fire and stipulated amongst other things that houses should be brick, windows recessed and that roofs should be slate and should not overhang. Ironically it is these rigid building regulations so resented at the time that have contributed to the Georgian house being so sought after today.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are significant historic buildings around Clapton Square, ranging from the medieval St Augustine's Tower Hackney the Tudor period Sutton House, the neo-classical Church of St John-at-Hackney, and the High Victorian Round Chapel all of them listed buildings and significant local landmarks.</p>\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Hackney Conservation Zones</li>\\n<li>History, development and archeology of Clapton Square</li>\\n<li>Clapton Square on Hackney's Conservation Zone walk</li>\\n</ul>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Claptonsq3.jpg\",\"people\":[{\"pageid\":9299024,\"title\":\"Zelda Kahan\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Zelda Kahan</b> (1886 \\u2013 1969) was a British communist.</p>\\n<p>Born into a Jewish family in Russia in 1886, Kahan's family were forced to emigrate, and she moved to Britain at an early age.

It comprises the area roughly surrounding, and extending north from Mare Street. It is situated 4 miles (6.4\\u00a0km) north east of Charing Cross. It is also the name of Hackney Central ward, an electoral division for Hackney Council.</p>\\n<p>Hackney Central is the area that once would have been known as <b>Hackney Village</b>. This was a place that flourished from the Tudor period, when principal members of the Court had their houses in the surrounding area, and King Henry VIII of England had a palace (located near the modern Lee Bridge Road roundabout). Hackney Central remained a popular resort for Londoners until the end of the Georgian era, when this suburb of London began to be completely built up. Railways, trams and factories brought an end to Hackney's rural atmosphere during the Victorian era, and its fortunes declined.</p>\\n<p>The industries of nearby Homerton and the Lee Valley have largely disappeared, leaving the NHS and local council as the largest employers. Successive waves of immigrants, both from abroad and within the United Kingdom, make modern Hackney a culturally vibrant part of inner London, with both the benefits and challenges that this brings.</p>\\n<p>Extensive post-war redevelopment has replaced much of the housing stock, but the Georgian housing and Victorian terraces that remain have become popular again.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>In 1727, Daniel Defoe said of the villages of Hackney</p>\\n<h3>Early origins</h3>\\n<p>Central Hackney was largely unchanged by Roman times, with Ermine Street passing to the west. The land was covered with open oak and hazel woodlands, with marshland around the rivers and streams that crossed the area. Hackney lay in the Catevallauni tribal territory.</p>\\n<p>The name Hackney derives from a 5th or 6th century Saxon settlement known as <i>Haca's ey</i> \\u2013 or raised ground in marshland. This was due to the proximity of Hackney Brook, and was probably located on the higher ground around the later St Augustine's Tower. Hackney is not specifically mentioned in the Norman Domesday Book, as at that time it formed a part of the manor of Stepney.</p>\\n<h3>Tudor village</h3>\\n<p>Little remains of early Hackney, except the Tudor St Augustine's Tower, which survives as Hackney's oldest building; and the positively medieval road network. The churchyard, Hackney Brook, and the surrounding villages prevented Hackney's expansion, and by 1605 the village had a lower rateable value than the other divisions of the parish. In Tudor times, there were a number of fine houses along Church Street, but many Tudor courtiers lived in nearby Homerton. On the site of Brooke House college, in Clopton was sited one of Henry VIII's palaces, where his daughter Mary took the Oath of Supremacy. Her guardian was a Bryck Place Homerton resident, Ralph Sadleir who was also Henry's Principal Secretary of State.</p>\\n<p>A further cluster of houses existed in medieval times, where Well Street enters Mare Street. It was on open ground, to the north-east of here that the Loddiges family founded their extensive nursery business in the 18th century.</p>\\n<h3>Georgian period</h3>\\n<p>By 1724, while still consisting of a single street, there is an unbroken line of buildings, except by the churchyard and by the brook, with large gardens behind for the finer houses and inns. The 16th-century church, despite galleries being installed, became too small for the needs of the parish, and parliament was petitioned in 1790 for a modern larger church to be built. This began in 1791 on a field to the north east of the old church, but was bedeviled by builders' bankruptcies and not finally completed until 1812\\u201313 when the tower and porches were added. Further disaster struck in a fire of 1955.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the churchyard stands the tomb of Francis Beaufort, devisor of the Beaufort scale; and that of John Hunter, the second governor of New South Wales. The Loddiges family also has a tomb in the churchyard, and memorials within the church. The parish burial register records the death of <i>Anthony, a poore old negro, aged 105</i> in 1630. This is all that is known of Anthony, but he is the first recorded Black resident of Hackney.</p>\\n\\n<p>The villages of Hackney, Lower Clapton and Homerton remained separated by fields into the 19th century. The fine houses remained, with large gardens behind. Artisans and labourers lived in cottages established in these gardens. There was not the room, or the will, for major rebuilding in the village. By 1800, St Thomas' Square, a Georgian square was laid out on the southern end of Mare Street. By the 20th century, these buildings had declined and were replaced with public housing. An early 18th-century mansion, now the <i>New Landsdown Club</i>, but once the headquarters of Elizabeth Fry's <i>British Ladies' Society for Promoting the Reformation of Female Prisoners</i> remains at 195 Mare Street. It is Grade II* listed, but in poor condition and on the English Heritage register of buildings at risk. In neighbouring Homerton, (to the east of the churchyard) Sutton Place was built by 1806, near to Sutton House.</p>\\n<p>The rebuilding of the Church, on a field to the north of the village altered the course of the road and allowed the establishment of Clapton Square in 1816, in nearby Lower Clapton. Much of the area to the north and east of the churchyard now forms the <i>Clapton Square Conservation Area</i>, designated in 1969.</p>\\n<h3>Victorian Hackney</h3>\\n\\n<p>During the Victorian era, many of the old buildings were swept away and the estates broken up to form streets of terraced housing. The change from rural suburb to firmly urban, was marked by the arrival of the railway in 1850, with a great iron rail bridge crossing Mare Street. Trams began to make their appearance on the streets in the 1870s, and a tram depot opened in 1882 on Bohemia Place.</p>\\n<p>Increased access and the culverting of Hackney Brook in 1859\\u201360, brought about the present road layout. Many older buildings were pulled down to intensify development and to make room for street widening and the railway. In 1802, The Old Town Hall was built on the site of the vestry house, by the tower. This was re-fronted in a <i>baroque</i> style in 1900. In turn, this building was replaced as being too small for the needs of the borough, the political centre moving to the front of today's Town Hall (1937). By the turn of the 20th century, only St Johns Gardens, and Clapton Square, the areas around the 1791 church, remained as public open space.</p>\\n<h2>Governance</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n\\n<p>Hackney Central is the conventional geographical core of Hackney, and in fact, before the 1899 London County Council reorganisation, it was what many would have understood to <i>be</i> Hackney, although the term <i>Hackney Proper</i> was often used to distinguish it from other local settlements such as South Hackney, West Hackney and Hackney Wick.</p>\\n<p>However, in terms of parish boundaries, up until 1835 the areas of <i>Hackney Proper</i>, Homerton, Upper and Lower Clapton, Dalston, De Beauvoir Town, Stamford Hill, and Kingsland all constituted the Parish of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>Since then, the term has been vastly extended to mean, firstly the 1899 Metropolitan Borough, then, after 1965, the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>Hackney Town Hall is about 5 miles (8\\u00a0km) north-east of Charing Cross; and 3.8 miles (6.1\\u00a0km) from the GLA City Hall near Tower Bridge.</p>\\n<h2>Landmarks</h2>\\n\\n<p>South of Hackney Central railway station Mare Street slices through Hackney's 'cultural quarter' of Town Hall Square. Its north side is dominated by Frank Matcham's Grade II* listed 1901 Hackney Empire music hall, on whose stage appeared Charles Chaplin and Marie Lloyd \\u2013 who lived in nearby Graham Road. On the west side of Town Hall Square is the 1934-7 Grade II Hackney Town Hall in Portland Stone, fronted by an open space created when its predecessor, the Hackney Vestry Hall of 1860 was demolished. A new town hall complex is being constructed behind the existing building. Opposite on the East side, is the 2001 refurbishment of the Central Library and Methodist Hall, combined to form the Ocean Music Venue.</p>\\n\\n<p>.</p>\\n<p>The square is completed by the 2002 Learning and Technology Centre. This houses the new Hackney Central Library, the Hackney Archive, the local museum and the offices of the Hackney Learning Trust.</p>\\n<p>The Clowns' archive and museum used to be housed behind the Town Hall. It relocated to the All Saints Centre, Haggerston around 2005; but the exhibition has since moved out of the borough to Wookey Hole.</p>\\n<p>North of the railway bridge, Mare Street continues as The Narroway (originally known as Church Street). By St Augustine's Tower, a Grade I landmark, is the 'Old Town Hall' built to serve the Parish of Hackney in 1802. It is now a betting shop. To the east are St Johns' Church Gardens. In 2009, they were awarded Heritage Green Flag status. Within the gardens stands the Church of St John-at-Hackney (built 1792).</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n\\n<p>The area is 2 miles (3.2\\u00a0km) north-east of the City of London with frequent trains from Hackney Downs railway station to Liverpool Street. Hackney Central railway station is a part of London Overground with westbound trains to Richmond, via Dalston Kingsland railway station and eastbound trains to Stratford, via Homerton railway station.</p>\\n<p>The existing connection to the Victoria line at Highbury and Islington tube station and Stratford railway station will be supplemented by a link to the extended East London line at Dalston.</p>\\n<p>The nearest London Overground station is <i>Hackney Central</i>.</p>\\n<h2>Economy</h2>\\n<p>The Narrow Way (<i>Church Street</i>) remains a busy shopping area, and there is a large Tesco supermarket in nearby Morning Lane (<i>Money Lane</i>). This international store group was founded in Hackney, from a market stall in Well Street market in 1919. A planning application for a multi-storey shopping centre (with parking beneath, and housing above) on the Hackney Tesco site was refused permission in 2010, and the future of the site remains uncertain. A former Burberry factory building is also located off Morning Lane, with a 'factory outlet' that is considered to be Hackney's most visited tourist attraction. This site is currently being redeveloped, in two phases, that will see the retention of the showroom, but add housing above.</p>\\n<p>The primary local employers are the council and the NHS at Homerton University Hospital; there are also two London Transport garages, one at the foot of the Narroway, and another about 1 mile south at Ash Grove. Between Ash Grove and London Fields there is a small industrial estate.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>Schools in the area include The Urswick School (formerly known as Hackney Free and Parochial Church of England Secondary School).

He is best known musically for being co-frontman of The Libertines, which he formed with Carl Bar\\u00e2t in 1997. His other musical project is indie band Babyshambles. In 2005, Doherty became prominent in tabloids, the news media, and pop culture blogs because of his romantic relationship with model Kate Moss and his frequently-publicised drug addictions.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Doherty was born in Hexham, Northumberland to mother Jacqueline (n\\u00e9e Michels), a nurse and lance corporal, and a Catholic father, Peter John Doherty, a major in the British Army. His paternal grandfather was Irish, from Cheekpoint, County Waterford; his maternal grandfather was Jewish (the son of immigrants from France and Russia) and his maternal grandmother was of English descent. He was raised Catholic. He grew up at a number of army garrisons, due to his father's work, living at various times at garrisons in Catterick, Belfast, Wildenrath Barracks in the north west of Germany, Bedworth, Dorset, and Larnaca, along with his mother and two sisters, Amy Jo and Emily. Doherty was the second of the three children. It was while in Dorset, at the age of 11, that Doherty was first inspired to play guitar. He started playing in order to impress classmate Emily Baker whom he fancied. 18 years later they were reunited where the now Brighton based singer/songwriter won his support slot. He achieved 11 GCSEs, 7 of which were A* grades, at Nicholas Chamberlaine Comprehensive School in Bedworth and four passes at A Level, two at grade A. At the age of 16, he won a poetry competition and embarked on a tour of Russia organised by the British Council.</p>\\n<p>After his A-levels, he moved to his grandmother's flat in London \\u2013 where he said he felt 'destined' to be \\u2013 and got a job filling graves in Willesden Cemetery, although most of his time was spent reading and writing while sitting on gravestones. In a clip later made famous by YouTube, an eighteen-year old Doherty can be seen in an interview with MTV, on the day of the release of Oasis' <i>Be Here Now</i> album. He attended Queen Mary, a college of the University of London, to study English literature, but left the course after his first year. After leaving university, he moved into a London flat with friend and fellow musician Carl Bar\\u00e2t, who had been a classmate of Doherty's older sister at Brunel University.</p>\\n<h2>Career</h2>\\n<h3>The Libertines</h3>\\n\\n<p>Doherty and Bar\\u00e2t formed a band called The Libertines in the late '90s, although it was not until 2002, with the release of their debut album <i>Up the Bracket</i>, that they began to achieve widespread mainstream success.</p>\\n<p>The group achieved critical and commercial success and gained a dedicated cult following, with Doherty in particular being praised by fans and critics alike as one of the most promising songwriters to emerge on the British music scene for some time. However, Doherty's increasing drug problems led to his estrangement from the band. In 2003, he was jailed for burgling Bar\\u00e2t's flat. The two initially fell out over this incident, but made amends whilst Doherty was in prison. He was originally sentenced to 6 months, but his sentence was cut to 2 months. Upon his release, Doherty immediately reunited with Bar\\u00e2t and the rest of the band to play a gig in the Tap 'n' Tin pub in Chatham, Kent.</p>\\n<p>Following his rejoining of the band, Doherty sought treatment for his drug addiction. He attended the alternative detox centre Wat Tham Krabok, a temple in Thailand, famous for its rehabilitation program for crack and heroin users. He left after three days and returned to England. As a consequence of this, The Libertines cancelled appearances that they were due to make at the Isle of Wight and Glastonbury festivals.</p>\\n<p>However, while post-production work was taking place on the second Libertines album in June 2004, Doherty was again asked to leave the band. The band cited Doherty's continuing drug addiction as the reason for his dismissal, but emphasised their willingness to take him back once he had addressed his addiction. Although Bar\\u00e2t had previously stated that the Libertines were merely on hiatus, pending Doherty's recovery, the group effectively disbanded with Doherty's departure at the end of 2004. The remaining members became involved in other projects (see Yeti and Dirty Pretty Things). On 12 April 2007, Pete Doherty and Carl Bar\\u00e2t played 13 songs together at the second of Doherty's \\\"An Evening with Pete Doherty\\\" gigs at the Hackney Empire, London.</p>\\n<p>In 2010 The Libertines reformed for appearances at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. They performed on 27 August at Leeds Festival and on 28 August at Reading Festival. The festival appearances were preluded by two gigs at the HMV Forum on 24 and 25 August.</p>\\n<h3>Collaborations</h3>\\n<p>Prior to the disbanding of The Libertines, Doherty collaborated with local poet Wolfman. Together they recorded the single \\\"For Lovers\\\", which entered the top 10, charting at number 7, in April 2004. Despite the success of the single, which was nominated for a prestigious <i>Ivor Novello Award</i> for songwriting, Doherty and Wolfman received relatively little money, having already sold the publishing rights for a small sum in a pub.</p>\\n<p>Later in 2004, Doherty provided guest vocals to the song \\\"Down to the Underground\\\" by the British group Client. The song was released in June 2004 as a B-side to the group's single \\\"In It for the Money\\\" and appears on their second album <i>City</i>.</p>\\n<p>In 2005 Doherty collaborated with the British rock band Littl'ans on the single \\\"Their Way\\\".</p>\\n<p>In 2006, Doherty was featured on the charity single \\\"Janie Jones\\\", which was released to raise funds for Strummerville. A number of artists and bands, such as Dirty Pretty Things, We Are Scientists, The Kooks and The Holloways, also featured on the track.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Pete_doherty_2007.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q311875\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":6161920,\"title\":\"Frank Turner\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Frank Turner</b> (born 28 December 1981) is an English folk/punk singer-songwriter from Meonstoke, Hampshire. Initially the vocalist of post-hardcore band Million Dead, Turner embarked upon a primarily acoustic-based solo career following the band's split in 2005. Both in the studio and during live performances, Turner is accompanied by his backing band, <b>The Sleeping Souls</b>, which consists of Ben Lloyd (guitar, mandolin), Tarrant Anderson (bass), Matt Nasir (piano) and Nigel Powell (drums).</p>\\n<p>To date, Turner has released five solo albums, two rarities compilation albums, one split album and five EPs. Turner's fifth studio album, <i>Tape Deck Heart</i> was released on 22 April 2013.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Turner was educated on a scholarship at Eton College, where he studied alongside Prince William, and later went on to attend the London School of Economics where he read History. His father, Roger Turner, is the son of Sir Mark Turner, formerly chairman of high street retailer BHS, and had himself also attended Eton before becoming a City investment banker, while his mother, Jane, the daughter of a bishop, is a primary school head teacher.</p>\\n<h2>Musical career</h2>\\n<h3>Beginnings and Million Dead</h3>\\n<p>The first record he owned was the \\\"Killers\\\" album from Iron Maiden. Metal was the first musical direction he adored and he still does. Turner's musical career began at school, with the short-lived alternative band Kneejerk. The band released three records and played several shows around the UK. The last record, their only full-length, was entitled <i>The Half Life of Kissing</i> and was released by Yorkshire DIY hardcore label Sakari Empire after the band had actually broken up.</p>\\n<p>In 2001, Turner joined London post-hardcore band Million Dead at the invitation of former Kneejerk drummer Ben Dawson. In 2005, after four years and two albums, the band announced that they were parting ways, as \\\"irreconcilable differences within the band mean that it would be impossible to continue.\\\" Around that time Turner got a tape with Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska on it - later he claimed that \\\"that was a really big moment for me hearing that record in terms of a turn around in my music career, from hardcore punk bands to what I\\u2019m doing now.\\\"</p>\\n<h3><i>Sleep Is for the Week</i> and <i>Love Ire &amp; Song</i> (2005\\u20132008)</h3>\\n<p>Turner's first solo shows took place prior to the break-up of Million Dead, with a set at the Smalltown America all-dayer at 93 Feet East in London. After the band's split, Turner felt that \\\"it seemed like the logical thing to do to try my hand at playing these songs more publicly and more concertedly than before\\\". Turner states that \\\"when Million Dead finished, I wanted to stay on tour, but I didn\\u2019t want the hassle of putting a band together.\\\"</p>\\n<p>After a split EP with rock band Reuben, Turner's first solo EP, <i>Campfire Punkrock</i>, was released in May 2006 on Xtra Mile Recordings, with him being recorded and backed by Oxford band Dive Dive who he had met while out on tour with Reuben. Band members Tarrant Anderson, Ben Lloyd and Nigel Powell would become his backing band from this point on, with most of his subsequent UK headline tours being full band shows. After touring in support of American singer-songwriter Jonah Matranga, the two released a split EP in August 2006. In September, he was the last act to appear on Steve Lamacq's \\\"Lamacq Live\\\" show on BBC Radio 1. Turner's debut full-length studio album, <i>Sleep Is for the Week</i> was released in January 2007, again recorded at Dive Dive's studio, produced by their guitarist Ben Lloyd and featuring drummer Nigel Powell.</p>\\n<p>After an extensive tour, including dates supporting yourcodenameis:milo and Biffy Clyro, and an appearance at SXSW, Turner released an EP, <i>The Real Damage</i>, in May 2007. After a further tour with Jonah Matranga and Jacob Golden, the \\\"All About The Destination\\\" DVD was released in October, before returning to the studio in Hampshire to record his second album. The album, <i>Love Ire &amp; Song</i> again saw Ben Lloyd from Dive Dive in the producer's seat, and was released on 31 March 2008, followed by an extensive UK tour with Andy Yorke and Chris T-T. T-T also joined the live lineup on keyboards through summer 2008.</p>\\n<p>During summer 2008, Turner made several festival appearances, including sets at Y Not Festival, Two Thousand Trees Festival, the Cambridge Folk Festival, Truck, Glastonbury, Jam By The Lake (in Durham) and the Reading and Leeds Festivals.</p>\\n<p>In October/November, during his 2008 UK Tour for the <i>Love, Ire and Song</i> album, he became ill with gastroenteritis, and was forced to leave the stage in Nottingham halfway through his set. All remaining shows, which included Nottingham, Liverpool and Ireland, were cancelled - the first time that Turner had cancelled any show in ten years. He went on to reschedule all cancelled shows in January 2009.</p>\\n\\n<h3><i>Poetry of the Deed</i> (2008\\u20132010)</h3>\\n<p>In December 2008 Turner released <i>The First Three Years</i>, a compilation of demos, b-sides and covers that are not featured on either of his studio albums. In January 2009, he released a combined package of <i>The First Three Years</i> and <i>Love Ire &amp; Song</i>, and supported The Gaslight Anthem on their tour of the UK and Europe, demoing several new songs and announcing his plans to record a new album in May. The album was produced by Alex Newport, as previously suggested in interview by Turner. His band at the time still consisted of Ben Lloyd, Tarrant Anderson and Nigel Powell from Dive Dive, with keyboardist Matt Nasir having been added on the <i>Love, Ire and Song</i> tour.</p>\\n<p>Prior to recording <i>Poetry of the Deed</i>, Turner stated that:</p>\\n<p>Turner was announced as the support act on The Offspring's summer tour, during which he documented his travels with a blog on British music website <i>NME</i>. Regarding the support slot, Turner stated: \\\"<i>Smash</i> was one of the first punk records I ever bought, and I\\u2019m blown away to even be considered for the shows. From a \\\"career\\\" point of view, it\\u2019s also great - playing to many thousands of people a night across the States is an opportunity not to be sniffed at.\\\"</p>\\n<p>On 28 April, Turner signed with Epitaph Records for releases outside the UK.</p>\\n<p>Preceded by the single \\\"The Road\\\", Turner's third studio album, <i>Poetry of the Deed</i>, was released on 7 September 2009 and reached #36 in the UK album chart. The following month he embarked upon a UK tour with his band in support of the album (with singer/songwriter Beans On Toast and US band Fake Problems as support acts), culminating in a sell-out show at the O2 Shepherds Bush Empire on 29 October 2009. A live DVD/CD, entitled <i>Take to the Road</i>, documenting two shows from the tour - Shepherds Bush Empire and the Union Chapel - was released in the UK in March 2010. In November 2009, Turner toured the US alongside Chuck Ragan, Jim Ward, Tim Barry, Joey Cape, Dave Hause, and others, as part of the 2009 Revival Tour. Turner returned to Europe on 28 November and to the UK on 19 December. He completed the year with a New Year's Eve show at The Spiegeltent in Gloucester.</p>\\n<p>In early 2010, Turner played several more UK gigs, with Chuck Ragan and Crazy Arm supporting. He also accompanied Flogging Molly and The Architects on the 2010 Green 17 Tour, and announced via his Twitter that he was working on new songs. From 22 April to 1 May of the same year, Turner toured Australia with Chuck Ragan, Tim Barry, and Ben Nichols of Lucero for the 2010 Revival Tour. In May 2010 Turner travelled to China to play a six city tour with promoters Split Works.</p>\\n<p>In June, he supported Green Day on their stadium shows, and also featured as the cover star of <i>Kerrang!</i> magazine for the first time, with an article inside documenting his solo career up to that point.</p>\\n<h3><i>Rock &amp; Roll EP</i>, <i>England Keep My Bones</i> and M\\u00f6ng\\u00f6l H\\u00f6rde (2010\\u20132012)</h3>\\n<p>Turner played at many festivals throughout the summer, including his headlining appearance at the Two Thousand Trees Festival, playing his new song \\\"I Still Believe\\\". The song was released first as a single and then appeared on his <i>Rock &amp; Roll EP</i>. Turner also contributed one song, a cover of \\\"Build Me Up Buttercup\\\", to Centrepoint's 2010 charity cover album <i>1969 Key to Change</i>. On 25 January 2011, he was nominated for two Shockwaves NME Awards, for best Solo Artist and best Band Blog or Twitter.</p>\\n<p>Turner announced on his Twitter on 24 February 2011 that his fourth studio album would be called <i>England Keep My Bones</i> and that it would be released in the UK on 6 June 2011 and worldwide on 7 June 2011. He also announced details of solo tours in Australia, Germany, UK, and the US &amp; Canada. Turner started recording of this album on 10 January 2011 and finished recording on 20 January 2011, with mixing completed in February 2011. In March 2011, Turner stated that:</p>\\n<p>Turner leaked new song, \\\"I Am Disappeared\\\" to YouTube on 29 March 2011, later making it available for free download through Xtra Mile. He also announced that he would soon be releasing \\\"Peggy Sang the Blues\\\" as the first single from the album.</p>\\n<p>On 21 March 2011, it was announced that Turner would be making the step up to the main stage at Reading and Leeds in August 2011. He spoke about the \\\"perks\\\" of playing Reading in a recent interview with 6 Towns Radio. He also played Download, Blissfields and Cambridge Folk festivals, as well as many other festivals across Europe, and as a headliner at Blissfields Festival. On 21 April 2011, Turner played his 1000th solo show at the Strummerville festival in Shoreditch, London.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Frank-Turner-XFM-session.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q451028\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":293321,\"title\":\"Damien Hirst\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Damien Steven Hirst</b> (born 7 June 1965) is an English artist, entrepreneur, and art collector. He is the most prominent member of the group known as the Young British Artists (or YBAs), who dominated the art scene in the UK during the 1990s. He is internationally renowned, and is reportedly the United Kingdom's richest living artist, with his wealth valued at \\u00a3215m in the 2010 Sunday Times Rich List. During the 1990s his career was closely linked with the collector Charles Saatchi, but increasing frictions came to a head in 2003 and the relationship ended.</p>\\n<p>Death is a central theme in Hirst's works. He became famous for a series of artworks in which dead animals (including a shark, a sheep and a cow) are preserved\\u2014sometimes having been dissected\\u2014in formaldehyde. The best known of these being <i>The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living</i>, a 14-foot (4.3\\u00a0m) tiger shark immersed in formaldehyde in a vitrine (clear display case). He has also made \\\"spin paintings,\\\" created on a spinning circular surface, and \\\"spot paintings\\\", which are rows of randomly coloured circles created by his assistants.</p>\\n<p>In September 2008, he took an unprecedented move for a living artist by selling a complete show, <i>Beautiful Inside My Head Forever</i>, at Sotheby's by auction and by-passing his long-standing galleries. The auction exceeded all predictions, raising \\u00a3111\\u00a0million ($198\\u00a0million), breaking the record for a one-artist auction as well as Hirst's own record with \\u00a310.3\\u00a0million for <i>The Golden Calf</i>, an animal with 18-carat gold horns and hooves, preserved in formaldehyde.</p>\\n<p>In several instances since 1999, sources for certain of Hirst's works have been challenged and contested as plagiarised, both in written articles by journalists and artists, and, in one instance, through legal proceedings which led to an out-of-court settlement.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Life and career</h2>\\n<h3>Early life</h3>\\n\\n<p>Damien Hirst was born in Bristol and grew up in Leeds. His father was reportedly a motor mechanic, who left the family when Hirst was 12. His mother, Mary Brennan, of Irish Catholic descent, worked for the Citizens Advice Bureau, and has stated that she lost control of her son when he was young. He was arrested on two occasions for shoplifting. However, Hirst sees her as someone who would not tolerate rebellion: she cut up his bondage trousers and heated one of his Sex Pistols vinyl records on the cooker to turn it into a fruit bowl (or a plant pot). He says, \\\"If she didn't like how I was dressed, she would quickly take me away from the bus stop.\\\" She did, though, encourage his liking for drawing, which was his only successful educational subject.</p>\\n<p>His art teacher at Allerton Grange School \\\"pleaded\\\" for Hirst to be allowed to enter the sixth form, where he took two A-levels, achieving an \\\"E\\\" grade in art. He was refused admission to Jacob Kramer school of art when he first applied, but attended the college after a subsequent successful application to the Foundation Diploma course.</p>\\n\\n<p>He went to an exhibition of work by Francis Davison, staged by Julian Spalding at the Hayward Gallery in 1983. Davison created abstract collages from torn and cut coloured paper which, Hirst said, \\\"blew me away\\\", and which he modelled his own work on for the next two years.</p>\\n<p>He worked for two years on London building sites, then studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths, University of London (1986\\u201389), although again he was refused a place the first time he applied. In 2007, Hirst was quoted as saying of <i>An Oak Tree</i> by Goldsmiths' senior tutor, Michael Craig-Martin: \\\"That piece is, I think, the greatest piece of conceptual sculpture. I still can't get it out of my head.\\\" While a student, Hirst had a placement at a mortuary, an experience that influenced his later themes and materials.</p>\\n<h3>Warehouse shows</h3>\\n\\n<p>In July 1988, in his second year at Goldsmiths College, Hirst was the main organiser of an independent student exhibition, <i>Freeze</i>, in a disused London Port Authority administrative block in London's Docklands. He gained sponsorship from the London Docklands Development Corporation. The show was visited by Charles Saatchi, Norman Rosenthal and Nicholas Serota, thanks to the influence of his Goldsmiths' lecturer Michael Craig-Martin. Hirst's own contribution to the show consisted of a cluster of cardboard boxes painted with household paint. After graduating, Hirst was included in <i>New Contemporaries</i> show and in a group show at Kettles Yard Gallery in Cambridge. Seeking a gallery dealer, he first approached Karsten Schubert, but was turned down.</p>\\n<p>In 1990 Hirst, along with his friend Carl Freedman and Billee Sellman, curated two enterprising \\\"warehouse\\\" shows, <i>Modern Medicine</i> and <i>Gambler</i>, in a Bermondsey former Peek Freans biscuit factory they designated \\\"Building One\\\". Saatchi arrived at the second show in a green Rolls Royce and, according to Freedman, stood open-mouthed with astonishment in front of (and then bought) Hirst's first major \\\"animal\\\" installation, <i>A Thousand Years</i>, consisting of a large glass case containing maggots and flies feeding on a rotting cow's head. They also staged Michael Landy's <i>Market</i>. At this time, Hirst said, \\\"I can\\u2019t wait to get into a position to make really bad art and get away with it. At the moment if I did certain things people would look at it, consider it and then say 'f off'. But after a while you can get away with things.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In 1991 his first solo exhibition, organised by Tamara Chodzko \\u2013 Dial, <i>In and Out of Love</i>, was held in an unused shop on Woodstock Street in central London; he also had solo exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, and the Emmanuel Perrotin Gallery in Paris. The Serpentine Gallery presented the first survey of the new generation of artists with the exhibition <i>Broken English</i>, in part curated by Hirst. At this time Hirst met the up-and-coming art dealer, Jay Jopling, who then represented him.</p>\\n<h3>Career in contemporary art</h3>\\n<p>In 1991, Charles Saatchi had offered to fund whatever artwork Hirst wanted to make, and the result was showcased in 1992 in the first <i>Young British Artists</i> exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in North London. Hirst's work was titled <i>The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living</i> and was a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine, and sold for \\u00a350,000. The shark had been caught by a commissioned fisherman in Australia and had cost \\u00a36,000. The exhibition also included <i>In a Thousand Years</i>. As a result of the show, Hirst was nominated for that year's Turner Prize, but it was awarded to Grenville Davey.</p>\\n<p>Hirst's first major international presentation was in the Venice Biennale in 1993 with the work, <i>Mother and Child Divided</i>, a cow and a calf cut into sections and exhibited in a series of separate vitrines. He curated the show <i>Some Went Mad, Some Ran Away</i> in 1994 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, where he exhibited <i>Away from the Flock</i> (a sheep in a tank of formaldehyde). On 9 May, Mark Bridger, a 35-year-old artist from Oxford, walked into the gallery and poured black ink into the tank, and retitled the work <i>Black Sheep</i>. He was subsequently prosecuted, at Hirst's wish, and was given two years' probation. The sculpture was restored at a cost of \\u00a31,000. When a photograph of <i>Away from the Flock</i> was reproduced in the 1997 book by Hirst <i>I want to spend the rest of my life everywhere, with everyone, one-to-one, always, forever, now,</i> the vandalism was referenced by allowing the tank to be obscured by pulling a card, reproducing the effect of ink being poured into the tank; this resulted in Hirst being sued by Bridger for violating his copyright on <i>Black Sheep.</i></p>\\n<p>In 1995, Hirst won the Turner Prize. New York public health officials banned <i>Two Fucking and Two Watching</i> featuring a rotting cow and bull, because of fears of \\\"vomiting among the visitors\\\". There were solo shows in Seoul, London and Salzburg. He directed the video for the song \\\"Country House\\\" for the band Blur. <i>No Sense of Absolute Corruption</i>, his first solo show in the Gagosian Gallery in New York was staged the following year. In London the short film, <i>Hanging Around</i>, was shown\\u2014written and directed by Hirst and starring Eddie Izzard. In 1997 the <i>Sensation</i> exhibition opened at the Royal Academy in London. <i>A Thousand Years</i> and other works by Hirst were included, but the main controversy occurred over other artists' works. It was nevertheless seen as the formal acceptance of the YBAs into the establishment.</p>\\n<p>In 1997, his autobiography and art book, <i>I Want To Spend the Rest of My Life Everywhere, with Everyone, One to One, Always, Forever, Now</i>, was published. With Alex James of the band Blur and actor Keith Allen, he formed the band Fat Les, achieving a number 2 hit with a raucous football-themed song <i>Vindaloo</i>, followed up by <i>Jerusalem</i> with the London Gay Men's Chorus. Hirst also painted a simple colour pattern for the Beagle 2 probe. This pattern was to be used to calibrate the probe's cameras after it had landed on Mars. He turned down the British Council's invitation to be the UK's representative at the 1999 Venice Biennale because \\\"it didn't feel right\\\". He sued British Airways claiming a breach of copyright over an advert design with coloured spots for its low budget airline, Go.</p>\\n<h3>2000s</h3>\\n<p>In 2000, Hirst's sculpture <i>Hymn</i> (which Saatchi had bought for a reported \\u00a31m) was given pole position at the show <i>Ant Noises</i> (an anagram of \\\"sensation\\\") in the Saatchi Gallery. Hirst was then sued himself for breach of copyright over this sculpture (see Appropriation below). Hirst sold three more copies of his sculpture for similar amounts to the first. In September 2000, in New York, Larry Gagosian held the Hirst show, <i>Damien Hirst: Models, Methods, Approaches, Assumptions, Results and Findings</i>. 100,000 people visited the show in 12 weeks and all the work was sold.</p>\\n<p>On 10 September 2002, on the eve of the first anniversary of the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks, Hirst said in an interview with BBC News Online:</p>\\n<dl><dd>\\\"The thing about 9/11 is that it's kind of like an artwork in its own right. It was wicked, but it was devised in this way for this kind of impact. It was devised visually... You've got to hand it to them on some level because they've achieved something which nobody would have ever have thought possible, especially to a country as big as America. So on one level they kind of need congratulating, which a lot of people shy away from, which is a very dangerous thing.\\\"</dd>\\n</dl><p>The next week, following public outrage at his remarks, he issued a statement through his company, Science Ltd:</p>\\n<dl><dd>\\\"I apologise unreservedly for any upset I have caused, particularly to the families of the victims of the events on that terrible day.\\\"</dd>\\n</dl><p>Hirst gave up smoking and drinking in 2002, although the short-term result was that his wife Maia \\\"had to move out because I was so horrible.\\\" He had met Joe Strummer (former lead singer of The Clash) at Glastonbury in 1995, becoming good friends and going on annual family holidays with him. Just before Christmas 2002, Strummer died of a heart attack. This had a profound effect on Hirst, who said, \\\"It was the first time I felt mortal.\\\" He subsequently devoted a lot of time to founding a charity, Strummerville, to help young musicians.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/The_Future_of_Art_-_Damien_Hirst.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q294326\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":23544593,\"title\":\"Prince Blanco\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Mark Matthews</b>, (born <b>Mark Hamilton Attrill</b>, 23 March 1965 in Newport, Isle of Wight, England), known by his stage name <b>Prince Blanco</b>, is a singer and musician based in Toronto, Canada, predominantly performing and recording in the reggae, ska and dub genre.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Mark was born in Newport on the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England. His mother was a hairdresser and his father, a musician. Following his parent's divorce, his mother remarried and the family moved to southwest London where he spent most of his youth and now going by the surname 'Matthews'.</p>\\n<h2>Musical background</h2>\\n<p>Mark's earliest musical influences were Elvis Presley, The Rolling Stones, Slade, T. Rex and the 'Trojan' reggae sound of the seventies such as Ken Boothe and The Upsetters. However it was the punk rock of the late seventies followed by the ska revival of the early eighties that got him involved in music. Mark picked up the drums and made several unsuccessful attempts at forming bands that would fuse the sounds of reggae and punk together, similar to what groups such as Basement 5, The Ruts, The Specials and of course, The Clash were attempting at the time.</p>\\n<h2>Canada</h2>\\n<p>Eventually relocating to Toronto, Canada in the late eighties, Mark continued to play drums but had by this time gained recognition as a singer leading to him give up the drums and join the powerpop group Living Room as lead vocalist. After three years, a number of critically acclaimed releases and tours the band broke up and Mark left music to pursue other interests and to spend time back in England. In 1996, Matthews reappeared on the Canadian music scene as the drummer/vocalist for ska group The Skanksters who released the influential <i>Dub Cookery</i> album in the US in 1997. The group eventually made several lineup changes to become Boogiewall Soundsystem, releasing the album <i>Supermyownband</i> in 2005 which featured one of the first 'official' vocal appearances of Prince Blanco.</p>\\n<h2>Prince Blanco</h2>\\n<p>In the late nineties, Mark began 'moonlighting' as a solo reggae and ska vocalist and also as a member of ska/calypso group, The Liquidaires under the name Prince Blanco. Mark had travelled to Jamaica a number of times during the 1990s and on one of these trips was given the opportunity to sing onstage with reggae singer Jack Radics and legendary trombonist Vin Gordon. He was introduced onstage with a name given to him earlier that afternoon by a local Rasta named Super...'King Blanco'. Mark said he was \\\"not worthy of being named a king\\\" and settled for Prince Blanco \\u2013 the name stuck. Over the last ten years, Prince Blanco has performed alongside artists such as Willi Williams, Michael Rose, Freddie McGregor and others. His most recent releases include the album <i>Rebel Discoth\\u00e8que</i>, two of three singles with producer Dubmatix and the <i>Shatter The Hotel</i> project, a benefit for Strummerville featuring various artists covering Joe Strummer compositions in a dub style.

In the early days, his passport occupation read \\u201cpurveyor of good times\\u201d and he went on to be nicknamed by music magazine Mixmag as the \\\"King Of Clubs\\\". With his Leeds based club night <i>Back To Basics</i>, Dave features as one of the youngest men in Leeds City Museum\\u2019s exhibition chronicling the popular culture of Leeds.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Dave Beer was born in Wakefield, West Yorkshire and grew up in a single parent family on a council estate in Pontefract. He attended Carlton High School as a teenager but left at the age of 16 looking for a new challenge.</p>\\n<p>He found solace in art and went onto study at Wakefield Arts College where he met his best friend and, later, fellow Back To Basics promoter, Alistair Cooke. The pair wanted to make films and be in a band and went on to study multi-media, film and TV at Sheffield University.</p>\\n<h3>Punk Youth</h3>\\n<p>As a youth, Dave was a rebellious punk; he dyed his hear red, wore a kilt and listened to punk anthems like White Riot and God Save the Queen. He followed bands like The Clash and The Cure across the country and once got into a gig, climbing in through a dressing room window, too young to get past the bouncers on the door.</p>\\n<h2>Career</h2>\\n<h3>Roadie and Tour Manager</h3>\\n<p>Dave\\u2019s obsession with the punk-music scene saw him become a groupie, hitching up with punk band The Clash. As a keen photographer, he captured many exclusive shots of the bands he followed incorporating them into art projects at college. His persistence on the tour circuit led to his first proper role as a roadie and later as tour manager for bands including That Petrol Emotion, The Ramones, Ghost Dance, The Utah Saints, and The Sisters of Mercy who he lived with at the time.</p>\\n<p>During a spell with Stourbridge noisemeisters, Pop Will Eat Itself, Dave found himself working on the 1987 Def Jam tour that included Public Enemy, LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C., but life as a tour manager would soon takes its toll.</p>\\n<p>Dave travelled the world several times over with numerous bands before he became fed up with life on the road. It was the birth of acid house in 1988 that sent Dave on a new tangent entirely. He visited the Ha\\u00e7ienda and the famed illegal warehouse parties in Blackburn getting his first taste of acid house, but when the Criminal Justice Act hit in 1991, outlawing parties in disused libraries and warehouses; Dave drew inspiration in the new music scene that was taking over England and wanted to be part of it.</p>\\n<h3>Back To Basics Promoter</h3>\\n<p>Dave faced the post-warehouse party world with the DIY ethos of a punk and Back To Basics was born on 23 November 1991, named literally to represent what the club set out to do.</p>\\n<p>Dave and Alistair grew tired of the acid house scene and wanted to put on parties where they and their friends wanted to go where alternative music to the rave scene was played. Through Back To Basics, they made clubbing fashionable, and throughout the 1990s it was one of the most desirable places to go, causing road blocks in Leeds city centre. At the time, Back to Basics had a strict, sometimes controversial and inconsistent door policy which made it one of the hardest clubs to get into. Dave personally greeted all 80 clubbers on the opening night and those who were refused entry due to their dummy sucking or poor choice of trainers were encouraged to try harder next time.</p>\\n<p>Its opening night was held on the top floor of The Chocolate Factory, which was later renamed, The Music Factory. Weeks two and three of Back To Basics saw the crowds double in size until it was attracting 1,000 clubbers every week. By Nov 1992 at the end of its first year, Dave and Alistair found themselves on stage at the Royal Albert Hall, looking out to a packed auditorium as they picked up the DMC and Mixmag Award for Best Club.</p>\\n<p>Over the next 20 years from 1991 to the present day, Dave toured Back To Basics all over the world from Australia to the USA and held club residencies at Home London, and Space Ibiza. He was responsible for nurturing the talent of Daft Punk, Basement Jaxx and Groove Armada giving them some of their first gigs as unknown artists. Dave was also responsible for bringing international talent into the UK for the first time including Danny Tenaglia, Josh Wink and Frankie Knuckles.</p>\\n<p>Back To Basics holds numerous awards from the music and events industry and has gained worldwide recognition thanks to its forward thinking music policy and loyal following. Today it is considered a \\\"household name\\\" in UK clubbing and Dave Beer continues to be \\\"the life and soul\\\" of the Basics party.</p>\\n<h3>DJ</h3>\\n<p>Over the years, Dave has DJ\\u2019ed to millions of people all over the world at the Berlin Love Parade alongside Radio 1 DJs Sara Cox and Pete Tong; at Creamfields, Glastonbury, Bestival and at Homelands where in 1999 he was flown in by helicopter to play to 40,000 people. Today he remains resident DJ at Back To Basics.</p>\\n<p>On the UK club scene, Dave has been a regular at the Chuff Chuff parties, his own big beat night, Backbeat; Renaissance, Gatecrasher, and at London superclub's Ministry Of Sound, The Cross, Turnmills, Heaven, and at The Elbow Rooms in Leeds where he was a resident DJ and musical consultant for several years.</p>\\n<p>In Ibiza, Dave\\u2019s first ever gig was on the sunset strip at Caf\\u00e9 del Mar and he has gone on to play at many more clubs on the island including Caf\\u00e9 Mambo, Manumission, Privilege, Pacha and Space.</p>\\n<h3>Producer</h3>\\n<p>Dave\\u2019s career as a music producer began when he teamed up with his Basics\\u2019 partner Alistair Cooke for their debut single <i>Keep The Faith</i>, which was released under the alias <i>The God Squad</i> in 1993 on Junk Rock Records.</p>\\n<p>Many releases followed for Dave including <i>I am Miami (You\\u2019re Looking At Him)</i>, produced under the alias <i>Out of Order</i> with Kriss Needs, released in July 1998 on Creation Records offshoot, Eruption Records. It gained interest from the music press including the NME and Muzik Magazine. Featuring the vocals from Stefan Frank and engineered by Dave Hedger Dave Beer described it as, \\u201cJust an off the wall track. I was always into that early electro Hip Hop sound. So it was a chance to get away from house music and mix things up a bit\\u201d. The music video featured a cameo of one of the biggest producers around at the time, Arthur Baker who drove an open top Cadillac in one of the scenes.</p>\\n<p>Dave\\u2019s remixing history includes re-rubs for David Bowie, The Rolling Stones, Afrika Bambaataa and Intastella. Throughout time, Dave\\u2019s production has been a varied reflection of his diverse musical influences.</p>\\n<h3>Musician</h3>\\n<p>Further developments in Dave Beer\\u2019s career have come in the formation of <b>The Blessed</b> - an eclectic live musical collaboration between Dave and techno producer Gareth Whitehead, head of Bulletdodge Records. The Blessed draws influences from Dave\\u2019s punk ethos and from a collection of house, funk, new wave and electro. The band - which features guest musicians up to as many as eight musicians on stage at one time including singers, guitarists, percussionists and brass players - debuted at the o2 Academy Leeds on Thursday 1 April 2010 as the support act for Fatboy Slim. With the incorporation of live visuals, the gig showcased young break-dancers connected with the <i>Mums Against Guns</i> campaign. House music producer Robert Owens also played with The Blessed that night.</p>\\n<p>The name <i>The Blessed</i> derives from the idea that one must count one\\u2019s blessings in life, and that life is for the living and must be lived to the full by everybody regardless of creed, colour or social status before it is too late. This idealism, regardless of one\\u2019s relativist position, is the lifeblood of The Blessed\\u2019s music and is their political message to bring people together.</p>\\n<h3>Label Boss</h3>\\n<p>Dave Beer turned his hand to label management in 1995 and set up Back To Basics Recordings with co-promoter and producer, Ralph Lawson, and Michael Hirst.</p>\\n<p>The label issued some of the biggest selling compilations of the 1990s including Cut The Crap in 1996 \\u2013 a three disc box set mixed by Ralph Lawson, Derrick Carter and the only commercially available DJ mix by Andrew Weatherall. It was listed by DJ Magazine at number 38 in a list of <i>100 Best Dance Compilations Ever</i>, and to this day is still considered to be \\\"the DJs\\u2019 DJ\\\" compilation.</p>\\n<p>Published in 2002 as part of the Back To Basics 10 year celebrations, the label released <i>Back To Basics Presents Danny Tenaglia</i> on React Records, the labels\\u2019 biggest selling compilation of the time.</p>\\n<h3>Designer</h3>\\n<p>During the 1990s and in light of his expressive fashion sense, Dave Beer launched his own fashion label named <b>Damage</b>. The collection featured men and women\\u2019s t-shirts made in quality fabrics, all boasting provocative motifs and slogans, which some say pioneered the way for the t-shirt slogan boom that followed in the late nineties.</p>\\n<p>Fashion title Drapers caught onto the label and featured it as a <i>One To Watch</i> as did men\\u2019s style magazine GQ. The range was later seen on the backs of celebrities such as Sienna Miller, Jude Law and Lily Allen.</p>\\n<h3>Artist</h3>\\n<h4>Back To Basics' Flyers</h4>\\n<p>Dave Beer has been the creative mind behind the Back To Basics club flyers since the night first began. Over the years, they have featured tongue-in-cheek, controversial imagery, many of which were heavily influenced by the punk explosion of the 1970s. The most famous of all Basics\\u2019 flyers is a piece of customised iconography of the Sex Pistols <i>God Save The Queen</i> album cover embossed with the Back To Basics punk slogan: <i>Two Steps Further Than Any Other Fucker</i>.</p>\\n<p>The artist behind the original images, Jamie Reid gave Dave Beer his blessing to adopt his work. He grew a close relationship with Dave and went onto showcase some of his own art at Back To Basics in late 1992. The Back To Basics adaption has gone on to become an iconic example of club art and its culture.</p>\\n<p>Back To Basics changed the way clubs flyered their nights, adding edge and personality through the use of controversial slogans and random imagery. The Back To Basics\\u2019 flyers made their way into a number of books including <i>Highflyers \\u2013 Club Rave Party Art</i>, <i>Fly \\u2013 The Art Of The Club Flyer</i>,<i>Once In A Lifetime \\u2013 The Crazy Days Of Acid House &amp; Afterwards</i>, <i>Jam: Style + Music + Media</i> and <i>Adventures In Wonderland: Decade of Club Culture</i>. The flyers were hung as artwork in Selfridges in London, at the Barbican Art Gallery, and a lot went under the hammer at <i>Sotheby\\u2019s</i>.</p>\\n<p>In 2012, a selection of limited prints based on the flyer artwork were exhibited at the Leeds Art Gallery and at Harvey Nichols in Leeds' city centre.</p>\\n<h4>Popular Culture</h4>\\n<p>Dave Beer has regularly used his influence and the popularity of Back To Basics to get involved in work outside of clubland, giving talks on popular culture to college and university students. At the Mint Club in Leeds on 16 June 1999, Dave delivered a speech at an event called <i>Arthrob</i> in conjunction with The Arts Council of England alongside readings from novelist Irvine Welsh, Miranda Sawyer, and Biyi Bandele. Over the years, Dave and Irvine grew close, and Irvine became a regular at Back To Basics, regularly sleeping on Dave\\u2019s sofa.</p>\\n<p>Dave also staged a Back To Basics and Northern Talent Production in association with Yorkshire Arts called Millennium or Bust. The night was an audience with Irvine Welsh, Howard Marks, Wayne Hemingway, and Dave himself, held at the Leeds University conference auditorium on 9 December 1999.</p>\\n<p>Dave also became close friends with author and filmmaker Howard Marks, who DJed at the Back To Basics 20th Birthday in November 2011. More recently, alongside Dave, Marks has narrated a documentary exploring the life and tales of Back To Basics, titled <i>Tales Of Glamour &amp; Excess</i>.</p>\\n<p>The pair teamed up in the showcase of Howard\\u2019s life stories \\u2013 a series of stand-up shows - that included a bizarre PowerPoint presentation featuring demonic images to the backing track of Sympathy For The Devil, remixed by Dave. The event was staged to promote Howard\\u2019s new book and first fictional tale, which shares its name with The Rolling Stones\\u2019 song. Marks mentions Dave in his second autobiography <i>Se\\u00f1ior Nice</i>.</p>\\n<p>Furthering his involvement in events outside of clubland, Dave DJ\\u2019ed at the Royal Ballet in Covent Garden where he was booked to create a music programme for a pre-choreographed performance. VJ Charles Kriel provided the visuals for this same event.</p>\\n<h2>Media</h2>\\n<p>At the height of Back To Basics\\u2019 success, the UK media cottoned onto Dave\\u2019s larger than life personality. His hedonistic tales became regular content in the likes of DJ Mag, NME, The Face and Mixmag, the latter of which included Dave in its Royal Family feature in 1998 - a double page spread profiling the greatest and most influential people in dance music of the time. The feature ran in celebration of the magazine\\u2019s 200th issue. A few years earlier in 1993, Dave appeared on the cover of NME\\u2019s November/December issue with the Manic Street Preachers.</p>\\n<h3>Television</h3>\\n<p>In June 1999, Dave took to the Channel 4 airwaves to take part in <i>Nightlife Legends</i>, a six-part series of late-night chat shows looking at the clubbing scene.</p>\\n<p>Even the BBC couldn\\u2019t ignore the impact that Dave Beer and Back To Basics were having on clubland, and not just in the UK, but on a global scale. On Basics\\u2019 18th Birthday in November 2009, BBC Look North headed down to Stinky\\u2019s Peephouse in Leeds to interview Dave about the success of his club night. On 1 March that following year, the BBC went into more depth looking at the history of Back To Basics in a documentary featured on <i>Inside Out</i> in which Basics was referred to as a \\\"national treasure\\\" and \\\"the stuff of legends\\\".</p>\\n<p>Appearances</p>\\n<ul><li>Club@vision, ITV (1996-1999)</li>\\n<li>Rapture TV ITV and Sky (1997-2007)</li>\\n<li>Nightlife Legends, Channel 4.

He also had his own Back To Basics radio show on Galaxy FM (now Capital) and made regular appearances on Kiss FM London and Kiss FM Leeds.</p>\\n<h2>Literature</h2>\\n<p>Dave\\u2019s party lifestyle, influence on the music scene and as an iconic figure in Leeds has been well documented throughout music literature. He speaks candidly about his Ha\\u00e7ienda days in <i>Superstar DJs Here We Go!</i>, offers opinion to Mick McCann\\u2019s encyclopaedic book of Leeds and its achievements in <i>How Leeds Changed The World</i>, and appears as himself in the music industry fictional tale <i>Kill Your Friends</i>.</p>\\n<p>In October 2003, a unique biography of Primal Scream was published \\u2013 <i>The Scream: The Music, Myths and Misbehaviour of Primal Scream</i> written by the band\\u2019s tour DJ, Kris Needs. In this book, Needs draws comparisons between the bands\\u2019 front man <i>Bobby Gillespie</i> and Dave Beer. Needs wrote, \\u201cSome of my closest friends in the clubbing community are Dave Beer and the city\\u2019s notorious Back To Basics Crew. If Clubland has a Primal Scream equivalent, it\\u2019s Dave Beer\\u201d. At Primal Scream\\u2019s Screamadelica Live Tour event on 14 March 2011 at the o2 Leeds Academy, Bobby Gillespie dedicated the show to his pal Dave Beer who was there in the crowd.</p>\\n<h2>Charity Work</h2>\\n<p>Throughout Dave\\u2019s life, his social conscience has always played part in the activities he has supported. In March 2002, he orchestrated Back To Basics\\u2019 involvement in World DJ Day \\u2013 the largest global fundraising activity the dance music industry had been involved in. A week of activities was held to raise funds for the Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy charity for needy children across the world. Dave held an event with DJ Jo Mills on 9 March 2002 to raise money for the charity.</p>\\n<p>Also in March 2002, Dave Beer threw his weight behind the Greenpeace Ancient Forest Campaign. The Save or Delete initiative invited clubbers to show their concern about the destruction of the world\\u2019s oldest forests by filling in vote-cards handed out at clubs across the UK. On 23 March as part of this weekend of conscious clubbing, Dave turned Back To Basics into a polling booth in support of the campaign.</p>\\n<p>Dave continues his charity work lending his support to Strummerville \\u2013 a charity set up by the family and friends of Joe Strummer in the year after his death; giving support to aspiring musicians and aid to projects that help change the world through music.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q5228318\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":4724491,\"title\":\"Emmy the Great\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Emma-Lee Moss</b> (born c. 1984), known by her stage name <b>Emmy the Great</b>, is a London-based singer-songwriter and journalist.

Since then, she has performed with indie folk groups Lightspeed Champion and Noah and the Whale, but is primarily known for her solo work. She first emerged under the name <i>Emmy the Great</i> in 2006, when she released a series of free demos over the internet. She says the moniker came about when \\\"[she] wanted to be a backing singer and [...] wanted to have something to hand to people... 'Emmy' is a name they called me at university, which I hated, and 'the Great' I added on because I hated 'Emmy' so much.\\\" She formed a backing band which currently includes Euan Hinshelwood of Younghusband, Glenn Kerrigan of So Say So, Tom Rogerson of Three Trapped Tigers and Ric Hollingbery of Pengilly's, and has previously included members of Noah and the Whale and Johnny Flynn.</p>\\n<p>Her debut single, <i>Secret Circus</i>, was released in April 2006.</p>\\n<p>She began writing her debut album, <i>First Love</i>, in \\\"dilapidated studios\\\" owned by The Earlies in rural Lancashire and was released in February 2009.

It is situated 3.5 miles (5.6\\u00a0km) northeast of Charing Cross. The area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London. Its historical borders are Kingsland Road and Kingsland High Street in the west, London Fields in the east, Downs Park Road in the north and the Shoreditch parish boundary in the south. Its main shopping street, Kingsland High Street, follows the route of the Roman Ermine Street, and has the road number A10. Modern Dalston is often seen as the area surrounding both sides of Kingsland High Street, even though some of the west side is within the London Borough of Islington.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The name Dalston is thought to have derived from <i>Deorlaf's tun</i> (farm) in much the same way as nearby Hoxton was named after the farm of 'Hoch'.</p>\\n<p>The village was one of four small villages within the Parish of Hackney (along with Newington, Shacklewell, and Kingsland) that were grouped for assessment purposes, together having only as many houses as the village of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>John Rocque's map of 1746 shows the village of Kingsland centred on the crossroads at what is now Dalston Junction and the small village of Dalston further east along Dalston Lane.</p>\\n<p>Around AD 1280 a leper hospital was founded in Dalston by the citizens of London and in AD 1549 it was attached to the chapel of St Bartholomew as an outhouse.</p>\\n<p>During the 18th and 19th centuries the area changed from an agricultural and rural landscape to urban one. By 1849, it was described as <i>a recently increased suburban village, with some handsome old houses</i>, and by 1859 the village had exceeded its neighbour and, with the railways and continuous building, the village of Kingsland disappeared.</p>\\n<h2>Redevelopment</h2>\\n<p>The gentrification of the area has led to a rapid increase in the price of property. The process of change was accelerated by the East London line extension, now part of London Overground. The reopening of Dalston Junction Station on this extension was part of London's successful bid to hold the 2012 Olympics.</p>\\n<h2>Entertainment</h2>\\n\\n<p>Dalston has always been an important transport and shopping centre. It was also, at one time, an important entertainment centre, with four or five cinemas within a radius of a \\u2153 of a mile, and the Dalston Theatre, a former hippodrome and music hall that later became the <i>Four Aces blues club</i> and the <i>Labyrinth nightclub</i>. The Dalston Theatre was demolished in February 2007, despite an active local campaign to save it.</p>\\n\\n<p>Dalston was a hub for 1970s and 1980s pub rock venues but these are largely defunct. However the new Dalston Culture House, the first wing of which has opened on Gillett Square, hosts the Vortex Jazz Club, moved from Stoke Newington in 2005.</p>\\n<h2>Notable people</h2>\\n<ul><li>Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie shared a house on St Mark's Rise in Dalston in the early 1980s</li>\\n<li>Emily Lloyd, actress</li>\\n<li>Sir Charles James Martin, FRS, FRCS, director of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine</li>\\n<li>Alan Spenner- Bass player with The Grease Band and Roxy Music</li>\\n</ul><h2>Shopping</h2>\\n\\n<p>Established in the 1880s, Ridley Road Market is opposite Dalston Kingsland railway station. Fruit and vegetables, some fairly exotic, are available. Halal butchers cluster around the high street end of the market.</p>\\n<p>Ridley Road market is reputedly the basis for the one found in the BBC's <i>EastEnders</i>. The Kingsland Shopping Centre (formerly Dalston Cross) is just south of Ridley Road market. Kingsland Road and the surrounding streets are home to an ever-growing number of trendy boutiques, bars and caf\\u00e9s.</p>\\n<h2>Area profile</h2>\\n\\n<p>Contemporary Dalston is a lively neighbourhood with an ethnically varied population. Architecturally it is a mixture of 18th and 19th century terraced houses and 20th century council estates. It is currently undergoing rapid gentrification, partly because of the redevelopment of the railway station at Dalston Junction and partly due to the revitalisation of large parts of east London in the build-up to the 2012 Olympics. (Hackney was one of the four host boroughs of the Games).</p>\\n<p>Dalston has attracted immigrants for over 100 years; at the turn of the century it was a popular area for newly arrived Jewish people from central Europe. In the fifties and sixties, as the Jewish community became more affluent and moved out, they were replaced by a large Caribbean community, which accounts for the wide choice of Caribbean food available in Ridley Road. As the Caribbean community slowly drifted out of Dalston it then became popular with the Turkish, as well as the Vietnamese. Recent arrivals include Poles, judging by the numbers of Polish delicatessens now appearing and other stores catering to Polish tastes.</p>\\n<p>Fassett Square was the inspiration for the BBC soap <i>EastEnders</i>. Originally, there were plans to film the series there, on location. However, Fassett Square (Albert Square) and Ridley Road Market (Walford Market) were rebuilt on the set in Elstree, near Borehamwood, to have a more controlled filming environment. The idea of Walford stems from Walford Road, and many of the houses on the show use the same exterior design. Coincidentally both Barbara Windsor and Tony Holland, one of the original creators of the show, lived at different times on the street.</p>\\n<p>That is not the only connection with entertainment industry. Around the corner, music hall artist Marie Lloyd (1870\\u20131922) used to reside on Graham Road. The house now has a blue plaque.</p>\\n<p>In April 2009 The Guardian published an article on Dalston claiming that it was the \\\"coolest\\\" place to live in Britain. In the same year however, sculpture park The Towers of Hackney was torn down to give way to new buildings.</p>\\n<h2>Pop-culture references</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>The 2007 film <i>Run Fat Boy Run</i> (directed by David Schwimmer) was filmed in Dalston (St. Mark's Conservation Area).

He put an ad in <i>The Stage</i> inviting applicants to join a new theater company, and began putting on plays in pub theaters. Soon after, Ergen co-founded the Southwark Playhouse with Juliet Alderdice and Tom Wilson in 1993. Ergen and his colleagues created the Theater after identifying possible areas in need for an accessible theater, which would provide its surrounding community with a hub for creativity. They converted a disused workshop into a theater space which quickly gained popularity, and by working closely with local teachers, the city council, businesses and government agencies, they were able to develop an innovative, free at source, education program. He was also the theatre\\u2019s first Artistic Director between 1993 and 1999.</p>\\n<p>Mehmet went on to become Associate Producer at the BAC (Battersea Arts Centre) from 1999 to 2001. While there he directed Scott Joplin's <i>Treemonisha</i>, Kurt Weill's <i>Lost in the Stars</i> and had a workshop performance of Marc Blitzstein's <i>The Cradle Will Rock</i>. It was during this period he also founded The Grimeborn opera festival. The Artistic Director at the time, Tom Morris, asked Ergen to create something new and different from the normal operatic preconceptions in a manner similar to that of Tete-a-Tete of the Riverside Studios. <i>Grimeborn</i> was his creation, an opera and musical theater festival that now runs yearly at Arcola Theatre.</p>\\n<p>In 2000, Ergen founded Arcola Theatre in the London Borough of Hackney with Leyla Nazli. They converted an old shirt factory while teaching in Dalston, East London, into a fringe venue. Ergen acquired \\u00a35,000 of start-up money and sent invitations to all the actors and directors he knew to join him in a paint party.

Born in Tuam, County Galway, Ireland, he currently lives in Dublin.</p>\\n<p>Murphy's first successful play, <i>A Whistle in the Dark</i> was performed at the Theatre Royal Stratford East in London in 1961 and caused considerable controversy both there and in Dublin when it was later given its Irish premiere at the Abbey having initially been rejected by its artistic director.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Life</h2>\\n<p>Murphy was born in Tuam, County Galway, the youngest of 10 children. His elder siblings gradually emigrated to Birmingham until he was left alone with his mother. He attended the local Christian Brothers college, and later became a metalwork teacher. He began writing in the late 1950s, saying, \\\"In 1958, my best friend said to me, why don't we write a play? I didn't think it was an unusual question, because in 1958 everyone in Ireland was writing a play\\\". His second play, A Whistle in the Dark, was written in his Tuam Kitchen on Murphy's free Friday and Saturday nights. It was entered into a competition for amateur plays, which it won, and was eventually produced in London in 1961, having being rejected by the Abbey Theatre. While Murphy was religious as a boy, his experience at the hands of the notoriously harsh Christian Brothers, left him largely irreligious. His 1975 play The Sanctuary Lamp was produced in the Abbey Theatre and received a hostile reception due to its anti-Catholic nature, with theatre goers walking out and much negative criticism in the media. After this controversy Murphy worked as a farmer for some years. He now lives in south Dublin.</p>\\n<h2>Writing career</h2>\\n<p>Considered by many to be Ireland's greatest living playwright (a title also often given to Brian Friel), Tom Murphy was honoured by the Abbey Theatre in 2001 by a retrospective season of six of his plays. His plays include the historical epic <i>Famine</i> (1968) which deals with the Irish Potato Famine between 1846 and spring 1847, the anti-clerical <i>The Sanctuary Lamp</i> (1975), <i>The Gigli Concert</i> (1983) and for many his masterpiece, the lyrical <i>Bailegangaire</i> and the bar-room comedy <i>Conversations on a Homecoming</i> (both 1985) .</p>\\n<p>His work is characterised by a constant experimentation in form and content from the apparently naturalistic <i>A Whistle in the Dark</i> to the surreal <i>The Morning After Optimism</i> and the spectacularly verbal <i>The Gigli Concert</i>. Recurring themes include the search for redemption and hope in a world apparently deserted by God and filled with suffering. Although steeped in the culture and mythology of Ireland, Murphy's work does not trade on familiar clich\\u00e9s of Irish identity, dealing instead with Dostoyevskian themes of violence, nihilism and despair while never losing sight of the presence of laughter, humour and the possibilities of love and transcendence. His works are often described as being filled with rage, with Murphy himself stating \\\"There is a rage in me which I think is a natural thing. It was in me when I was 24 or 25, scribbling with my stub of a pencil. And it's still there in everything I do. Rage not against the unfairness of life \\u2013 life is of course unfair \\u2013 but against the inequalities, the arrogance of power.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Younger playwrights whose work shows an indebtedness to him include Conor McPherson, Martin McDonagh and Gary Mitchell. His latest plays include <i>The Wake</i> (1997), <i>The House</i> (2000) and <i>The Alice Trilogy</i>, which premiered in 2005 at the Royal Court Theatre in London with Juliet Stevenson in the eponymous role. In 2006 Murphy directed the Irish premiere of the same play at the Peacock Theatre in Dublin with Jane Brennan in the lead role.

She had released a solo album, <i>Superpinkymandy</i>, in 1993. Since the album was only released in Japan, it went largely unnoticed by international audiences. Her second solo album, <i>Trailer Park</i>, garnered much critical acclaim in 1996. Orton developed a devoted audience with the release of the albums <i>Central Reservation</i> (1999) and the 2002 UK top 10 album, <i>Daybreaker</i>. In her 2006 release, <i>Comfort of Strangers,</i> she moved towards a more folk-based sound and away from the electronic sound of her past albums.</p>\\n<p>American films and television programmes such as <i>Felicity</i>, <i>How to Deal</i>, <i>Charmed</i>, <i>Dawson's Creek</i>, <i>Vanilla Sky</i> and <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> have featured her music and provided her with exposure to a more mainstream American audience.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early career</h2>\\n<p>Orton was born in East Dereham, Norfolk, but moved to Dalston, east London at age 14. Her father, an architectural draughtsman, left her mother when Beth was 11, and she lived with her mother, an artist and political activist, and her two brothers, her father dying shortly afterwards. Her mother died from cancer in 1989, when Beth was aged 19, which led to her travelling to Thailand for a short period, residing with Buddhist nuns. Orton found success as a musician relatively late, having first worked at menial jobs such as a waitress at Pizza Hut and even owning her own catering company. She was also more interested in acting during her early career, having enrolled at the Anna Scher Theatre School, and she spent some time touring <i>Une Saison en Enfer</i> with a fringe theatre company throughout the UK, Russia and Ukraine, playing Rimbaud's lover.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Beth_Orton.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q465296\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":19570720,\"title\":\"Roy Shirley\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Ainsworth Roy Rushton Shirley</b> (18 July 1944 \\u2013 July 2008), better known simply as <b>Roy Shirley</b>, and also known as <b>King Roy Shirley</b> and <b>The High Priest</b>, was a Jamaican singer whose career spanned the ska, rocksteady and reggae eras, and whose \\\"Hold Them\\\" is regarded by some as the first ever rocksteady song. He was also one of the original members of The Uniques.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Biography</h2>\\n<p>Shirley was born on North Street in Kingston, Jamaica, on 18 July 1944, and grew up in Trench Town, where he attended the Boys Town school, and after singing in his local church choir began his career performing in talent contests. His second prize performance on Vere Johns' talent show brought him to the attention of then Minister of Culture Edward Seaga and bandleader Byron Lee, who gave him work on shows that they promoted.</p>\\n<p>After early recordings for producer Simeon L. Smith went unreleased, he moved on to work with Leslie Kong, who released his debut single \\\"Oh Shirley\\\", co-arranged with his friend Jimmy Cliff, giving him a hit in 1965. Shirley then formed The Leaders along with Ken Boothe, Joe White, and Chuck Josephs. This group was unsuccessful, but Shirley went on to join Slim Smith and Franklyn White in the original line-up of The Uniques. When this line-up folded, Shirley recorded \\\"Hold Them\\\" in 1966, credited as one of the first rocksteady songs, and inspired by the beat from a Salvation Army band. Shirley attempted to perform \\\"Hold Them\\\" to a ska beat, but unable to make it work, slowed down the rhythm. He initially attempted to record the song with Slim Smith and Ken Boothe for producer Joe Gibbs, but it didn't work out, with the other singers struggling to break away from the ska style, and Gladstone Anderson suggested to Gibbs that Shirley perform the song solo. The song became a massive hit in Jamaica, and Shirley recorded several more singles for Gibbs, including \\\"Dance The Arena\\\", \\\"The World Needs Love\\\", and \\\"Music Is The Key\\\", but these failed to match the success of the first single. Shirley moved on to work with Bunny Lee giving the producer his first hit with \\\"Music Field\\\", which was followed by others such as \\\"Get on the Ball\\\". Shirley's style draws heavily from American soul singers such as Solomon Burke. He became renowned for his ecstatic stage performances, often performing wearing a long silver cape with a high collar, and was described by the <i>Jamaica Observer</i> as \\\"perhaps the most comedic performer to evolve out of Jamaican popular music\\\". In late 1968, Shirley set up his own <i>Public</i> label and began self-production, releasing tracks such as \\\"Prophecy Fulfilling\\\", \\\"Flying Reggae\\\", and \\\"On Board\\\".</p>\\n<p>Shirley had another big hit in 1971 with \\\"A Sugar\\\" for Randy's. He toured the United Kingdom in 1972 with U-Roy and Max Romeo, and became based in the UK from 1973, setting up his <i>All Stars Artistic Federated Union</i> in 1976, with the aim of helping other artists to avoid some of the pitfalls of the music business. He released his first album in 1976, with <i>The Winner</i>. He performed at Reggae Sunsplash in 1982, and was included on the album of performances from the festival. Shirley opened a record shop in Dalston, London, and in his later years he set up the British Universal Talent Development Association, with the aim of supporting talented but underprivileged youngsters. He continued to perform occasionally, and his last show was at the Sierra Nevada World Music Festival in June 2008.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q7373360\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":18555279,\"title\":\"Sam Mehran\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Sam Mehran</b> [pronounced <i>'merr-anne'</i> ] (born August 18, 1986) also known as Sam Meringue, is an American Australian musician best known for being a member of short lived band Test Icicles, as well as having been in a large number of other side projects.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Mehran was born in Miami in Florida, America.

Distinguished pupils included Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, British Prime Minister from 1768-1770, and two Founding Fathers of the United States (Middleton and Nelson). The family descended from Henry Newcome, a prominent nonconformist minister in Manchester. His third son Peter was an Anglican priest, and the father of the Henry Newcome who gave the school its name.</p>\\n<p>The school closed in 1815, and the building was knocked down in 1820.

In some case a prologue or epilogue was written specially. The school was one of a group that acted as preparatory schools to Westminster School; the dramatic tradition imitated Westminster's, with the difference that plays were in English (rather than Latin). One of the contributors of prologues was David Garrick. The custom of giving a play every three years was also taken over from the Elizabethan statutes of Westminster School.

London Fields received a Green Flag award in July 2008. A much-used cycle path runs from the <i>Pub on the Park</i> to Broadway Market. London Fields also has a railway station linking it to Hackney Downs and to Liverpool Street in the City. The Pub on the Park is the starting point for the annual Dunwich Dynamo night cycle ride.</p>\\n<p>Every Saturday, a wide variety of producers from around the country take part in the market, selling hot foods, hand-made jewellery, gifts, childrenswear and vintage clothing. Every Sunday, the local London Fields Primary School now hosts the London Fields Farmers' Market and there is a crafts market adjacent to the building next door.</p>\\n<p>A document in Hackney library records a game of cricket to have been played on the park as early as 1802, and the cricket square on London Fields continues to host competitive games throughout the summer (late April\\u00a0\\u2014 mid September). Several teams from the North East London Cricket League regard the park as their home pitch, most notably London Fields CC, based from the Pub on the Park. During the summer the park can be extremely busy with many people combining an afternoon's picnic with watching the cricket. The Turley End of the ground is a popular vantage point for those watching the cricket.</p>\\n<p>The area has been connected with some notable instances of gun crime in recent years.

The event was scheduled for April, but in March 2011, Schaffauser, as Chair of Out East, published an open letter on the <i>Pink News</i> website, calling for the cancellation of East End Gay Pride and was joined by Terry Stewart of the Hackney Community Engagement Board, Denis Fernando of Unite Against Fascism and the Greater London Association of Trade Union Councils. Schaffauser wrote the letter on behalf of Out East, a member of Rainbow Hamlets, the Tower Hamlets LGBT Forum, and highlighted a range of issues, including the potential for Islamophobia, the English Defense League's links with some of the organisers and the need for a political response.</p>\\n<p>By July 2011, Rainbow Hamlets continued to intensively engage with the East London Mosque &amp; London Muslim Centre (ELM), while Out East introduced weekly meetings in mid-2011 to provide a forum in which people could discuss what they would like to occur as a response. An event was eventually organised and, on 24 September, the East London Pride march set off from Hackney Town Hall. In what was a much smaller event than Hackney Pride, participants walked to the Oxford House building on Hackney Road, where the mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, a British-Asian Muslim, addressed the crowd: \\\"I want you to be in no doubt I will fight to ensure there is respect for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender culture and rights in the same way I will for all communities.\\\"</p>\\n<h2>Writing and acting</h2>\\n<p>Schaffauser co-authored <i>Fi\\u00e8res d'\\u00eatre putes</i> (with Ma\\u00eetresse Nikita, 2007) and wrote six articles on sex work for the <i>Guardian</i> in the first half of 2010, including a piece titled \\\"Time for porn stars to self-organise\\\".

The hamlet of Homerton (Humberton or Hummerton, named for the farm of a woman named Hunburh) developed for about a half-mile along the road on the north side of the now buried and lost Hackney Brook, within the vale formed by the brook. This led from the hamlet of Clopton, passing near the church of St Augustine at Hackney, then across the marshes and the crossing points of both the River Lea, and its tributary, Hackney Brook. By 1605 Homerton was the most populous part of the Parish of Hackney, becoming a separate parish in 1846.</p>\\n<h3>Medieval Homerton</h3>\\n<p>In medieval times, Homerton, like much of Hackney, was predominantly rural and arable crops were grown, together with fruit and vegetables for the City of London markets. The majority of land was given over to pasture for sheep and cattle, and milk and cheese was also supplied to the City. Small kitchen gardens ran at the back of the houses along the road, with large fields behind. Domestic brewing was common (there are records of brewing performed at Sutton House and the Tan House). Many unsavoury activities (banned in the City) were also undertaken, such as tanning and fulling - the cleaning of felt cloth using urine.</p>\\n<h3>Tudor wealth</h3>\\n\\n<p>Homerton became a desirable suburb of London in the Tudor period, with many estates and grand houses being formed from the former Templar lands (Knights Templar of St. John of Jerusalem). The village was divided between Upper and Lower Homerton, with the later extending towards the marshes and the house at Hackney Wick. Upper Homerton was divided from the village of Hackney by the width of the rectory manor's Church Field, and a path led to the churchyard. In 1538, this estate, including other fields lying along the brook, passed to the Tudor diplomat Sir Ralph Sadler. Around 1560 part of this estate came into the ownership of Thomas Sutton, a resident of the Tan House (adjacent to Sutton House). This land formed part of his endowment of the Hospital of King James in Charterhouse, who continued to own the property until the 20th century, building Sutton Place between 1790 and 1806.</p>\\n<h3>The marshes</h3>\\n\\n<p>Marsh Road, from Homerton High Street, led to, and across the marshes, towards the Templar owned water powered corn mill at Temple Mills. Prone to flooding, the marshes were primarily used for grazing. A Roman stone causeway was discovered in the 1770s.</p>\\n<p>By 1795 the former Templar mills were being used for preparing lead. Sheets of lead were placed in clay pots and submerged in urine, then heated by decaying cow dung. The process converted the lead to lead oxide, and it was then finely ground to form a pigment for white, yellow and red lead paint. A new watermill was established on the marshes by Prince Rupert for an improved method of boring guns, however the secret died with him in 1682 and the enterprise collapsed.</p>\\n<h3>Religion and education</h3>\\n\\n<p>In the 18th century the availability of land, large houses and tolerance to dissenters made Homerton a popular place to found institutions. The educational ones were commonly known as Dissenting Academies. The Kings Head Society moved to a large house here in 1768, forming Homerton College for the education of Calvinist ministers with between 12-20 students. Religious education moved to the new University College London in 1826, but Homerton College remained here as a teacher training college until 1896, when it moved to Cambridge, eventually becoming a full college of the University of Cambridge offering nearly all subjects from 2002. Students from Homerton college were principal in forming, in 1881, both the Glynn Cricket Club and Clapton Orient - which became Leyton Orient F.C. on its move to Leyton. The buildings of the College were rebuilt and expanded several times, but eventually lost to bomb damage in World War II.</p>\\n\\n<p>South of the Brook, by Money Lane, the Unitarian Gravel Pit Meeting House was built between 1715-16. This was the result of an acrimonious split in the congregation of the Lower Clapton meeting. Notable nonconformist ministers preached at the Old Gravel Pit. The moral and political philosopher Richard Price, known for his support of the American Revolution, became morning preacher in 1770, while continuing his afternoon sermons at Newington Green Chapel, on the green where he lived. Those who attended his sermons in Homerton included American politicians such as John Adams, who later became the second president of the United States, and his wife Abigail. On the 101st anniversary of the Glorious Revolution, he preached a sermon at Old Jewry meeting house entitled \\\"A Discourse on the Love of our Country\\\", thus igniting a so-called \\\"pamphlet war\\\" known as the Revolution Controversy, furiously debating the issues raised by the French Revolution. Burke's rebuttal \\\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\\" attacked Price, whose friends Thomas Paine and Mary Wollstonecraft leapt into the fray to defend their mentor. The reputation of Price for speaking without fear of the government on these political and philosophical matters drew huge crowds to his sermons, which were published and sold as pamphlets (i.e. publications easily printed and circulated). Another eminent minister was the formidable polymath, Joseph Priestley, discoverer of oxygen. When his support of dissent led to the riots named after him, he fled Birmingham and headed for London; he was appointed minister here in 1793. Today a Blue Plaque marks the site of the Gravel Pit Meeting House in Ram Place and a brown plaque marks the site of the Priestley's house at 113 Lower Clapton Road (on the corner of Clapton Passage). Priestley said of his time here, \\\"On the whole I spent my life more happily at Hackney than I had ever done before\\\". The meeting house is now used as a factory.</p>\\n<h3>Victorian era</h3>\\n<p>A spur connecting the North London Railway at Dalston to Stratford, forming a part of the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway, opened in 1847 for the carriage of coal. This resulted in Hackney Brook being placed in a culvert and the loss of the extensive watercress fields to the south of Homerton High Street. Its later development as a passenger line led to the redevelopment in the 1880s of the medieval core of the village on Homerton High Street with Victorian dwellings and public houses, and speculative building on the lands either side of Homerton High Street. In 1868 Homerton Station opened.</p>\\n<p>By the 1860s, London fell prey to epidemics of fever. The 200 bed Eastern Fever Hospital was founded in September 1870 by the Metropolitan Asylums Board to prevent contagion. There were six wards for typhus, two each for scarlet fever and enteric patients. Two smaller wards were reserved for 'special cases'. The buildings were demolished in 1982 and the site became the core of the modern Homerton University Hospital. This replaced the old Hackney Hospital which (in turn) had been formed from the Hackney Union Workhouse. These buildings are now used by the Hackney Mental Health Trust.</p>\\n<h3>Industry and housing</h3>\\n<p>The coming of the railways and the building of the fever hospital drove many of the wealthier residents away. The tightly packed Victorian streets provided homes for the clerks and employees of the new purpose built factories (like Berger Paints) being built in the area. From 1937 onwards, the London County Council built mass housing, sweeping away the worst of the slums, but also eliminating many older buildings containing shops on Homerton High Street, effectively destroying it as a commercial area. The Lesney die cast model factory was built in the 1940s on the Homerton side of the Lee Navigation, just north of Homerton Road, producing for many years their <i>Matchbox</i> brand. The factory closed in 1990, and was demolished in 2010.</p>\\n<p>The oldest surviving residential building in Hackney is Sutton House on Homerton High Street. It was built in 1535 and is owned and run by the National Trust.</p>\\n<h3>In modern times</h3>\\n\\n<p>1970s glam rock singer Marc Bolan and actor Ray Winstone were born in Hackney Hospital, on Homerton High Street. The hospital, originally built in 1841 as the Hackney Union workhouse, finally closed in 1995, its poor reputation contrasting with that of the new Homerton University Hospital which opened in 1987 on a site nearby. The old hospital has now been refurbished (2006) and reopened to serve the mental health trust.</p>\\n<p>Homerton's links with popular music continued with the arrival of Toerag, an eight track recording studio which uses reclaimed 1960s analogue equipment, where notably the White Stripes' acclaimed 2003 album <i>Elephant</i> was produced. Babyshambles frontman and ex-Libertine, Pete Doherty has reputedly given his address as Homerton  but it has been confirmed that he is receiving treatment as an outpatient at Homerton University Hospital for addiction.</p>\\n\\n<p>Homerton is also home to Chats Palace arts centre, named after the nearby Chatsworth Road. Chats Palace has presented and encouraged a wide variety of music, comedy, theatre, photography, carnival, disability arts, dance and transgressive performance, including Clifford Jarvis, Tom Hunter, Miniscule of Sound, Red Saunders, Asian Dub Foundation and Graeae Theatre Company. It also hosts an array of classes for all abilities and age ranges, and has been an accessible and affordable space for local people to celebrate their important occasions or present their projects. The building itself was originally established as a Carnegie library for the betterment of the people of the East End. The council closed the library in 1977 but the building was reclaimed by members of the local community.</p>\\n<p>Although this has been, in recent years, a rather depressed area of Hackney, itself a poor borough, Homerton's prospects are brightening. The arrival of the Channel Link at nearby Stratford, coupled with the London Summer Olympics, which took place nearby in 2012, may spell a revival in its fortunes.</p>\\n<p>Homerton is served by Homerton University Hospital, an NHS foundation trust hospital.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>Secondary schools located in the area include Cardinal Pole RC School and the City Academy, Hackney.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<p>The nearest London Overground stations are <i>Hackney Central</i> and <i>Homerton</i></p>\\n<h2>References and notes</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>Tudor Hackney (from the National Archives)</li>\\n<li>Hackney 1795 (<i>Hackney</i>, The Environs of London: volume 2: County of Middlesex)</li>\\n<li>Jacobs, Catherine <i>I Want to Go Home</i> (Book Guild Ltd) ISBN 1-85776-925-2 - Growing up in Homerton, a family memoir</li>\\n</ul><h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Chats Palace Arts Centre</li>\\n<li>Homerton University Hospital</li>\\n<li>Sutton House information at the National Trust</li>\\n<li>Toerag Studios</li>\\n</ul>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Chats_palace_1.jpg\",\"people\":[{\"pageid\":1860137,\"title\":\"Ugo Ehiogu\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Ugochuku \\\"Ugo\\\" Ehiogu</b> (/\\u02c8\\u025bhi\\u0252\\u0261/; born 3 November 1972 in Homerton, London) is an English former professional footballer who played as a centre back from 1989 to 2009.

He soon formed a friendship with future Iron Maiden guitarist Dave Murray, who inspired him to take up the guitar. After leaving school at 16, he formed a band called Urchin, which he led until their demise in 1980. He joined Iron Maiden in November 1980, replacing Dennis Stratton. Following a short-lived solo project called A.S.A.P, he left Iron Maiden in 1990 and formed a group called Psycho Motel. In 1997, Psycho Motel was put on hold and he joined the band of former Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson. Smith and Dickinson returned to Iron Maiden in 1999, after which the band gained new success. Smith has a current side project called Primal Rock Rebellion.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Biography</h2>\\n<h3>Early years and Urchin: 1957\\u20131980</h3>\\n<p>Born in Hackney, Smith grew up in Clapton. He purchased his first record, Deep Purple's <i>Machine Head</i>, at the age of 15. This led him to befriend Dave Murray, with whom he formed a band called Stone Free, which comprised Murray on guitar, Smith on vocals and their friend, Dave McCloughlin, playing the bongos. After seeing the attention Murray received from girls, Smith took up the guitar, starting with an old Spanish guitar once owned by his brother, before purchasing an old one of Murray's for \\u00a35. His early influences included Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, which he claims made him a \\\"melodic player\\\" rather than a \\\"speed merchant or a shredder\\\" as he \\\"was inspired by blues rock rather than metal.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Leaving school after completing his O-levels, Smith formed a band called Evil Ways, including Dave Murray on guitar, which was later renamed Urchin. In this outfit, Smith began writing his own material, including \\\"22 Acacia Avenue\\\", which was later included on Iron Maiden's <i>The Number of the Beast</i> (1982). At this point, Murray left the band to join Iron Maiden and Urchin signed with DJM Records and released a single, \\\"Black Leather Fantasy\\\", in 1977. Shortly afterwards, Murray joined Urchin on their next single, \\\"She's a Roller\\\", as he had been sacked from Iron Maiden after a row with then vocalist Dennis Wilcock, although he was reinstated six months later. Smith was also offered a place in Iron Maiden while they were in the process of signing with EMI in 1979, but turned them down to continue with his own band, a decision he later regretted as Urchin split up in 1980.</p>\\n<h3>First tenure in Iron Maiden: 1980\\u20131990</h3>\\n\\n<p>Without a band, Smith was left \\\"wondering what to do next,\\\" before he \\\"literally bumped into Steve [Harris] and Dave,\\\" who asked if he might want to reconsider joining. After a successful audition, Smith debuted with the band on a German TV show, before setting out on a UK tour and recording the <i>Killers</i> album, released in 1981. Smith's first song-writing contributions appeared on <i>The Number of the Beast</i>, co-penning \\\"Gangland\\\" and \\\"The Prisoner\\\", as well as the previously mentioned \\\"22 Acacia Avenue\\\", after which he began co-writing many songs with singer Bruce Dickinson, on the following <i>Piece of Mind</i> album.</p>\\n<p>Smith and Dave Murray combined playing dual lead guitars, creating what AllMusic calls \\\"the most formidable twin-guitar attack in heavy metal, outside of Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing.\\\" Smith, along with Steve Harris, also provides the band's backing vocals, although he sang lead on \\\"Reach Out\\\", the B-Side to the \\\"Wasted Years\\\" single, featuring Bruce Dickinson on backing vocals. Originally written by guitarist Dave \\\"Bucket\\\" Colwell, whom he had worked with on The Entire Population of Hackney project, Smith would later sing \\\"Reach Out\\\" again for Colwell's solo album, <i>Guitars, Beers &amp; Tears</i>, released in 2010.</p>\\n<h3>Departure from Iron Maiden and other projects: 1989\\u20131999</h3>\\n<p>While Iron Maiden were taking some time off in 1989, Smith released a solo LP with the band ASAP (Adrian Smith And Project), entitled <i>Silver and Gold</i>, which was a commercial failure in spite of a promotional club tour. Unhappy with the direction the band were taking for their next release, <i>No Prayer for the Dying</i>, Smith agreed to leave Iron Maiden in 1990 during the album's pre-production stages, and was replaced by Janick Gers. After releasing the experimental <i>Somewhere in Time</i> and <i>Seventh Son of a Seventh Son</i> albums in 1986 and 1988 respectively, Steve Harris had decided that the band should go for a \\\"stripped-down,\\\" \\\"street level\\\" approach, which Smith thought was a \\\"step backward.\\\" <i>No Prayer for the Dying</i> contained one last Smith song, co-penned with Bruce Dickinson, entitled \\\"Hooks in You\\\".</p>\\n<p>After leaving, Smith started a family with his Canadian wife, Nathalie, and would not play guitar again until he joined Iron Maiden onstage at Donington Park in 1992 to perform \\\"Running Free\\\". In the same year, after hearing King's X for the first time, he decided that he would \\\"love to play in a band like that\\\" and formed The Untouchables, which later became Psycho Motel. The band recorded two albums, <i>State of Mind</i> in 1996 and <i>Welcome to the World</i> in 1997, during which they supported Iron Maiden on the British leg of The X Factour. The project was put on hold, however, when Smith joined Bruce Dickinson for his 1997 album, <i>Accident of Birth</i>, after which he became a full-time member of Dickinson's solo outfit, embarking on two world tours and contributing to one further studio release, 1998's <i>The Chemical Wedding</i>.</p>\\n<h3>Return to Iron Maiden: 1999\\u2013present</h3>\\n\\n<p>In 1999, Smith re-joined Iron Maiden, along with vocalist Bruce Dickinson, who commented, \\\"When he left the band in 1990, I think everybody was a bit surprised at how much we missed him and certainly, I don't think anybody had realized how much the fans would miss him \\u2013 big time. I wouldn't have rejoined Iron Maiden if he wasn't in the band. I just don't think it would have been complete without Adrian, and now, it's great having three guitarists.\\\" The band embarked on a short tour, after which the new line-up's first album, <i>Brave New World</i>, was recorded with producer Kevin Shirley and released in 2000.</p>\\n<p>He remains in Iron Maiden, with whom he has released three further studio albums, 2003's <i>Dance of Death</i>, 2006's <i>A Matter of Life and Death</i> and 2010's <i>The Final Frontier</i>. Smith claims that his guitar playing improved after leaving the band in 1990, in particular while working with Roy Z, from whom he \\\"learned a lot about picking\\\" and became \\\"more disciplined.\\\" Since returning to Iron Maiden, he has also continued experimenting with tuning (which he began doing in Psycho Motel), stating that he has used drop D tuning in live renditions of \\\"Run to the Hills\\\", \\\"Wrathchild\\\", \\\"The Trooper\\\" and \\\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\\". Although Smith had previously been known to contribute shorter, more \\\"commercial\\\" tracks, since his return to the band he has penned many longer songs, beginning with \\\"Paschendale\\\" from <i>Dance of Death</i>.</p>\\n<p>Smith performs lead guitar, bass and backing vocals on the album <i>Awoken Broken</i> by his collaborative studio project with Mikee Goodman of SikTh called Primal Rock Rebellion. The title was released on 27 February 2012, while one song, \\\"I See Lights\\\", was released as a free download on the project's official website on 2 January.</p>\\n<h2>Personal life</h2>\\n<p>Adrian Smith was born in Hackney Hospital and grew up a few streets away from his childhood friend, and current band-mate, Dave Murray. Smith, whose father was a painter and decorator from Homerton, was the youngest of three, with an older brother, Patrick, and a sister, Kathleen. As a child, he was \\\"a Manchester United fanatic,\\\" although he would lose his interest in football once he got into music.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Adrian_Smith_@_Bluesfest_July_6_2010.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q212070\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":57973,\"title\":\"Tony Robinson\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Sir Anthony \\\"Tony\\\" Robinson</b> (born 15 August 1946) is an English actor, comedian, amateur historian, TV presenter and political activist.

However following the acquisition of that building by property developers, the club relocated in 2005 to the Dalston Culture House in Gillett Street, N16, where it is at the heart of the newly created Gillett Square, one of mayor Ken Livingstone's 100 public spaces for London. The Square opened on 10 November 2006 with a performance by Andy Sheppard's Saxophone Massive, composed of 200 saxophonists. The street in front of the club was renamed Aim Bailey Place in December 2007, after guitarist Derek Bailey.</p>\\n<p>Many notable jazz musicians have played at the Vortex, including Last Amendment, F-IRE Collective, Derek Bailey, Kenny Wheeler, Evan Parker, John Etheridge, Tim Berne, Ian Shaw, Lianne Carroll and Django Bates. The first release on the club's own record label is by the Portico Quartet. The Jazz Club also hosts a Vocals@Vortex Open Mic Session which is run by Romy Summers and the house band The Bob Stuckey Trio. This gives aspiring vocalists and musicians the opportunity to perform in a well-respected venue. Many artists have been discovered through their talent by this successful evening. Most notably, Daniel Farrugia, a young Jazz pianist from North London, made his debut performance at Vocals@Vortex before performing elsewhere in the capital on the Jazz scene. It also has a popular monthly Gypsy/Eastern European night hosted by Gina Boreham which began in 2006 with Dunajska Kapelye's debut concert.</p>\\n<p>The club was started by ex-taxi driver David Mossman in the late eighties, and through his open-minded booking policy it became perhaps the only venue which consistently was able to put on contemporary jazz nightly, justifying the epithet \\\"London's listening jazz club\\\". The new venue in Dalston continues this approach and attitude.</p>\\n<p>The club was nominated as a venue of the year by the Parliamentary Jazz Appreciation Group in 2006 and 2007 and was winner of the Live Jazz Award in 2013.</p>\\n<p>Since 26 March 2012, the club has been listed, in Time Out's readers' poll, as one of London's best music venues and received a nomination for Live Promotion Team of the Year in Music Week's awards in 2011.</p>\\n<p>In 2007, the club set up a record label, Vortex Records, in order to release the debut album by london buskers Portico Quartet. The album went on to be nominated for the 2008 Mercury Music Prize.</p>\\n<p>The original club developed such an affinity with its locality that local residents established the Occupied Vortex Social Centre at the club's original site for two months in early 2007 in protest at the proposed demolition of the building for the construction of a Starbucks and upmarket apartments. The original building is now a Nandos.</p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>List of jazz clubs</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Vortex Club website</li>\\n<li>Vortex Jazz Club, London, concert listings @ Last.fm</li>\\n</ul>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Dalston_culture_house.jpg\",\"people\":[{\"pageid\":17979876,\"title\":\"Howard Riley (musician)\",\"text\":\"<p><b>John Howard Riley</b> (born 16 February 1943, Huddersfield) is an English jazz pianist and composer.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Howard_Riley.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q1631893\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":0},{\"pageid\":224764,\"title\":\"Penny Rimbaud\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Jeremy John Ratter</b> (born 8 June 1943) is better known as <b>Penny (Lapsang) Rimbaud</b>. He is a writer, poet, philosopher, painter, musician and activist. He was a former member of the performance art groups EXIT and Ceres Confusion, and in 1972 was co-founder with Phil Russell aka Wally Hope of the Stonehenge Free Festivals. In 1977, alongside Steve Ignorant, he co-founded the seminal anarchist punk band Crass which disbanded in 1984. From that time up until 2000 he devoted himself almost entirely to writing, returning to the public platform in 2001 as a performance poet working alongside Australian saxophonist Louise Elliott and a wide variety of jazz musicians under the umbrella of Penny Rimbaud's Last Amendment.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Having very early on fallen foul of his father's 'real world', Rimbaud adopted a youthful waywardness which developed later into a committed form of bohemianism. Contemptuous of any authority, he was expelled from two public schools, Brentwood School in South East England and Lindisfarne College in North Wales. Rather than joining the ranks of the unemployed, he elected to study philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford, before quickly realising that, in his own words, 'Oxford wasn't about learning, but about a peculiarly unpleasant form of class indoctrination'.</p>\\n<h2>Name</h2>\\n<p>Ratter's name of choice, Rimbaud, the French symbolist poet, was deed polled in 1977. In his own words he 'wanted to be his own child.' His Oxbridge brother, Anthony, had often referred to him as being 'a toilet-seat philosopher' which prompted him to choose the forename Penny, that being the currency necessary at the time for entry into public toilets. The middle name \\\"Lapsang\\\" was added at the last moment to add what Rimbaud felt was 'a touch of the exotic'.</p>\\n<h3>A life of art</h3>\\n<p>Rimbaud enrolled at the South East Essex Technical College and School of Art in the early 1960s, where he met his lifelong creative partner Gee Vaucher. While there, he was quick to realise the potential within the then fledgling pop art movement, scoring considerable success as an innovator. His works were included in the Northern Young Contemporaries and on the back of this he was offered the possibility of working at Andy Warhol's 'Factory'. He refused on the grounds that he 'had better things to do', something which he claims never to have regretted. In 1964 he appeared on Granada TV's <i>Ready Steady Go!</i> to receive a prize from John Lennon for winning a competition staged by the pop show \\\"Ready Steady Go!\\\" to produce a piece of artwork depicting The Beatles' song \\\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand Rimbaud worked briefly as an art teacher before becoming disillusioned with education and then spent some time working as a coalman.</p>\\n<h3>Words and action</h3>\\n\\n<p>In 1967, inspired by the film <i>Inn of the Sixth Happiness</i>, Rimbaud set up the anarchist/pacifist open house, Dial House, in Essex, UK, which has now become firmly established as a 'centre for radical creativity'. It was from there, in the early seventies, that alongside Phil Russell aka Wally Hope he co-founded the Stonehenge Festival as documented in his autobiography of 1998, 'Shibboleth \\u2013 my revolting life'.</p>\\n<h3>Phil Russell's death and the birth of Crass</h3>\\n<p>As documented in 'Shibboleth', Russell was arrested and incarcerated in a mental institution after having been found in possession of a small amount of LSD. He was later released, but appeared to have been seriously mentally damaged by his experiences, especially the side effects of prescription drugs that he had been administered, and subsequently died. The official verdict is that Russell committed suicide, although Rimbaud claims that he uncovered strong evidence that he was murdered. Rimbaud has also stated that it was his anger over unanswered questions surrounding his friend's death that fuelled and inspired him in 1977 to form Crass, the anarchist punk band whose frequent battles with the authorities, notably the government of Margaret Thatcher, are well documented in Shibboleth.</p>\\n<p>When Crass disbanded in 1984, Rimbaud adopted an almost hermit-like existence, writing and publishing poetry, philosophy, essays, novels and plays. In 2001 he returned to the public platform as a performance poet, firstly working alongside saxophonist Ed Jones and then with Louise Elliott who has now become his full-time accompanist. In 2003, with Crass vocalist Eve Libertine, he founded what at first was the <i>Crass Collective</i>, then the Crass Agenda and finally the Last Amendment. Last Amendment is a loose collective of jazz musicians, artists and filmmakers sharing Rimbaud's lifelong interest in progressive, improvisational art.</p>\\n<h3>Written works</h3>\\n<p>His works include the originally self-published <i>Reality Asylum</i>, a vitriolic attack on Christianity which in heavily revised form was featured on Crass' 1978 debut album <i>The Feeding of the 5000</i>, as a longer single and as a 45-minute spoken word monologue.</p>\\n<p>He also wrote <i>Rocky Eyed</i>, an extended poem attacking then prime minister Margaret Thatcher and her government following the 1982 Falklands War which was recorded as the Crass album <i>Yes Sir, I Will</i>, <i>The Death of Imagination</i> (a 'musical drama in 4 parts'), <i>The Diamond Signature</i> (published by AK Press) and <i>Oh America</i>, a response to the September 11, 2001 attacks and America's subsequent War on Terror which includes the line <i>Give us justice which is not the searing spite of revenge, peace which is not the product of war nor dependent upon it</i>.</p>\\n<h2>Current work</h2>\\n\\n<p>Since 2003 he has worked as part of Crass Agenda (later Last Amendment), performing live and releasing CDs. Titles include <i>Savage Utopia</i>, a collaboration with Coldcut's Matt Black and other jazz musicians, and <i>How?</i>, a reworking of Allen Ginsberg's beat poem <i>Howl</i>, recorded live at the Vortex Jazz Club.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/GiaKimonoPennyRimbaud2.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q321672\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":31098930,\"title\":\"Max Eastley\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Max Eastley</b> (born 1 December 1944, Torquay, Devon) is a sound and visual artist.

Critic Ron Wynn describes Parker as \\\"[a]mong Europe's most innovative and intriguing saxophonists ... his solo sax work isn't for the squeamish.\\\"</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early influences</h2>\\n<p>His original inspiration was Paul Desmond, and in recent years the influence of cool jazz saxophone players has again become apparent in his music \\u2014 there are tributes to Warne Marsh and Lee Konitz on <i>Time Will Tell</i> (ECM, 1993) and <i>Chicago Solo</i> (Okkadisk, 1997).</p>\\n<h2>Later work</h2>\\n<p>Parker is better known, however, for his later work, which rapidly assimilated the American avantgarde \\u2014 John Coltrane, Pharoah Sanders, Albert Ayler and others \\u2014 and forged his own, instantly identifiable style. His music of the 1960s and 1970s involves fluttering, swirling lines that have shape rather than tangible melodic content; sometimes he makes use of pure sound in a manner that recalls Steve Lacy's more radical 1970s recordings or the work of some AACM members. He began to develop methods of rapidly layering harmonics and false notes to create dense contrapuntal weaves; these involved experiments with plastic reeds, circular breathing and rapid tonguing which initially were so intense that he would find blood dripping onto the floor from the saxophone. He also became a member of the important big band, The Brotherhood of Breath.</p>\\n<p>Later recordings are equally impressive but rather less thorny, and more consistent in style, as Parker's style became less open to change; but an Evan Parker recording is still always something to contend with, and some of his recent discs, such as <i>America 2003</i>, are as gripping and satisfying as any of his earlier recordings.</p>\\n<p>Parker has also increasingly become interested in electronics, usually through inviting collaborators such as Phil Wachsmann, Walter Prati, Joel Ryan, Lawrence Casserley or Matthew Wright to electronically process his playing in real time, creating a musical feedback loop or constantly shifting soundscape.</p>\\n<h2>Recordings</h2>\\n\\n<p>Parker has recorded a large number of albums both solo or as a group leader, and has recorded or performed with Peter Br\\u00f6tzmann (including Br\\u00f6tzmann's epochal <i>Machine Gun</i> in 1968 and Michael Nyman's \\\"Waltz in F\\\" (1981)), John Stevens, Derek Bailey, Keith Rowe, Joe McPhee, Anthony Braxton, Cecil Taylor, John Zorn, Fred Frith, Bill Laswell, Ikue Mori, Cyro Baptista, Milford Graves, George Lewis, Tim Berne, Mark Dresser, Dave Holland, Sylvie Courvoisier, and many others. Two key associations have been pianist Alexander von Schlippenbach's trio with Parker and drummer Paul Lovens (documented on recordings such as <i>Pakistani Pomade</i> and <i>Elf Bagatellen</i>) and a trio with bassist Barry Guy and drummer Paul Lytton. On Parker's 50th birthday, these two bands played a set apiece at a London concert; the results were issued by Leo Records as <i>50th Birthday Concert</i>.</p>\\n<p>Parker is one of the few saxophone players for whom unaccompanied solo performance is a major part of his work.</p>\\n<p>Parker, Bailey and the drummer Tony Oxley founded the Incus record label in 1970. The label continued under Bailey's sole control, after a falling-out between the two men in the early 1980s.

He has been described as \\\"\\u2026an acoustic guitar loyalist who always manages to combine a classical delicacy with the fire of rock\\\".</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early years</h2>\\n<p>John Russell was raised by his paternal grandparents in rural Kent, and his grandfather gave him his first guitar at the age of 11. At school, he taught himself guitar and formed a group to perform his compositions. He discovered free improvisation after King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp suggested that Derek Bailey and Sonny Sharrock were the two musicians doing the most to push the boundaries of the instrument. On moving to London at the age of 17, he quickly became involved with the free improvisation scene, playing at The Little Theatre Club (run by drummer and educator John Stevens), becoming a member of the Musicians' Co-op and starting to organise concerts. In 1975, he helped co-found the journal <i>Musics</i>. Russell took weekly lessons in conventional technique from Derek Bailey for about a year, then in 1977 he gave up the electric guitar to play the acoustic guitar exclusively.</p>\\n<h2>Music</h2>\\n<p>While his mature guitar technique inevitably overlaps with that of Derek Bailey, there are important differences. In a review of <i>Analekta</i> (Emanem, 2006) Nate Dorward writes: \\\"Russell's debt to the instrumental vocabulary of Derek Bailey is clear throughout, especially in his attraction to wide intervals, his resolutely segmented, percussive attack, and his systematic variation of timbre and means of production (open string, fretted, harmonic, behind-the-bridge pling); its in subtler matters of pacing and mood that his individuality comes through. He tends to dwell pensively, almost circularly, on chords or motivic cells that Bailey would have brusquely disposed of, and has a very different approach to group playing, preferring to merge into the larger ensemble sound (whatever the size of the group), and play with rather than against or aslant his musical partners.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Apart from solo playing, Russell can be seen playing in numerous one-off performances with musicians at his monthly Mopomoso club in London. He tours regularly, has a long-running trio with saxophonist John Butcher and violinist Phil Durrant and duos with Roger Turner, Stefan Keune, Phil Minton, Evan Parker and Luc Houtkamp. In 1981, he founded Quaqua, an ensemble that varies in size and draws from a large pool of improvisers.</p>\\n<p>In 1983, he appeared in the Channel 4 TV documentary <i>Jazz on Four: Crossing Bridges</i> which looked at four innovators of jazz and improvised guitar. The other players were Brian Godding, Fred Frith, Ron Geesin, Hans Reichel and Keith Rowe. His feature on the late Japanese improvising guitarist, Masayuki Takayanagi was broadcast on BBC Radio 3's <i>Jazz on 3</i> on 22 February 2010.</p>\\n<p>Other notable improvising acoustic guitar recordings include <i>Green Wood</i> (Emanem, 2002) by Roger Smith and <i>Velocity of Hue</i> by Elliott Sharp (Emanem, 2003).</p>\\n<h2>Acta records</h2>\\n<p>In 1988 Russell helped establish Acta Records in association with John Butcher and Phil Durrant in order to release the trio's debut recording <i>Conceits</i>. The label went on to produce a number of vinyl LPs, CDs and cassettes with a focus on free improvisation.</p>\\n<h2>Mopomoso</h2>\\n<p>In the mid-1980s Russell founded the improvised music club Mopomoso with help initially from pianist, trumpeter and composer Chris Burn. The club promoted around 300 regular monthly concerts at the Red Rose Club in London until the venue's transfer of ownership in January 2008. The club relocated to The Vortex Jazz Club later that same year and its monthly promotions are ongoing.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/JohnRussell(musician)_April2010.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q1701626\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":24204018,\"title\":\"Philip Jeays\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Philip Jeays</b> (born Philip Harris on June 24, 1962) is a British singer-songwriter.

While immensely well connected to Central London, including the City of London, the seat generally has moderate incomes rather than high, and a narrow majority of wards had a relatively high ranking when placed in the Index of Multiple Deprivation, compiled in 2000. In line with most of Greater London since 2000 many parts, especially Stamford Hill, Upper Clapton, Lower Clapton have become marginal in terms of local councillors and these districts, with to a lesser extent the eponymous Hackney and Stoke Newington, are in the process of becoming re-gentrified with ongoing increases in land value, proximity to the London 2012 venues and a council that successfully reduced the level of crime by about 30 per cent within a four year period. Demographically, almost 60 per cent of households are singletons and households have a higher than average level of unemployment. Through all this change, under incumbent Diane Abbott, the seat has become a safe seat for Labour. Abbott is the politician who for many years preceded Alan Milburn as Labour's latest events commentator opposite Michael Portillo on the current light-hearted political round-up of events series <i>This Week</i>.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The seat was created in 1950 and has gone through many changes: in January 2006 the boundary moved again, this time to correspond with the local government ward boundaries.</p>\\n<p>Following major electoral reform at the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885, part of the Third Reform Act, the seat of Hackney was divided into two and Hackney North was formed, this time to return only one Member of Parliament, commencing with the 1885 general election.</p>\\n<p>The Stoke Newington constituency was created at the 1918 general election by the division of the Hackney North constituency by the Representation of the People Act, 1918, known generally as Fourth Reform Act; an Act most importantly remembered for the first time extending suffrage to women. The constituency was identical in area to the Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington.</p>\\n<p>Following a decrease in the population the two constituencies were merged by the Representation of the People Act, 1948, retaining David Weitzman as MP and becoming the current constituency in the 1950 general election.</p>\\n<h2>Boundaries</h2>\\n<p><b>1950-1955</b>: The Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington, and the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney wards of Leaside, Maury, Southwold, Springfield and Stamford.</p>\\n<p><b>1955-1974</b>: The Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington, and the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney wards of Northfield, Northwold, Rectory and Springfield.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>The constituency covers the northern part of the London Borough of Hackney.

There is often a provocative polemic accompanying the shows. The <i>Girl on Girl</i> (January 2004) text stated:</p>\\n<dl><dd>Girl on Girl examines a new sensibility in art. Made by girls and about girls it makes a virtue of discontent, sexual disruptiveness and bad manners. This work reclaims the girly and the slutty not in a riot girl, feminist or \\u2018woman in art\\u2019 way but with a cultural celebration, that has both the shy and the brash as equal role models. Think PJ Harvey, Frida Kahlo, The Slits, Karen Kilimnik, Artemisia Gentileschi, Patti Smith, Meg White, think sense of conviction and to hell with the consequences.</dd>\\n</dl><p>Transition Gallery received press attention in February 2004 when a painting exhibited by then-obscure artist Stella Vine was bought for by Charles Saatchi and given international media coverage for its controversial depiction of Diana, Princess of Wales. It was titled <i>Hi Paul Can You Come Over</i> and showed the Princess with heavy eyes and blood dripping from her lips.</p>\\n<p>In March 2004, Liz Neal's Archway council flat studio was recreated as an installation inside the gallery for a show called <i>The Lair of the Lotus Eater</i>. Her work was exhibited in the Saatchi Gallery's <i>New Blood</i> show in the same year.</p>\\n<p>In 2005, <i>Evening Standard</i> critics, Nick Hackworth and Brian Sewell, visited the gallery. Hackworth wrote: It looks like a small garage workshop, but instead of Star Motors the legend reads: \\\"You don't have to be blonde to be an artist, but it helps.\\\" Inside, the walls are papered with magazine pages, photographs and postcards on the theme of quintessential Englishness; among them are paintings by Lomax and Michon. There is a subversive innocence about the installation.</p>\\n<p>In 2006, the gallery moved slightly further west to Regent Studios, which is also home to the MOT gallery, and close to the gallery hotspot of Vyner Street.

In 2004, Charles Saatchi bought <i>Hi Paul can you come over I'm really frightened</i> (2003), a painting by her of Diana, Princess of Wales, which provoked media controversy, as did a subsequent painting of drug victim, Rachel Whitear.

In the same year, Vine provided clothing designs for Topshop.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Stella Vine was born Melissa Jane Robson in Alnwick, Northumberland, England in 1969. She changed her name to \\\"Stella Vine\\\" in 1995, inspired by Andy Warhol names. Vine lived with her mother who was a seamstress and her grandmother who was a secretary. Her mother remarried when she was seven, and they relocated to Norwich. Vine said she was \\\"making things and performing music and plays, as far back as I can remember.\\\" When she was a child, she used to make water colours in the library, painting Queen Victoria, and copying the Pre-Raphaelites and Greek Mythology.</p>\\n<p>After a difficult relationship with her stepfather, Vine left home aged 13. Vine lived in the infamous Argyle Street, Norwich squat before being briefly fostered in Brixton, London but her new foster parents were unable to cope with her wilfulness. Vine then moved back to Norwich, to teach herself in the Norwich Reference Library. She moved into a bedsit on St Stephen's Street, Norwich, where she started a relationship with a 24-year-old caretaker. Vine's first job was at age 14 in a local Norwich cake shop. Two years later she became pregnant, and at the age of 17, gave birth to a son, Jamie, moving with him into a home for single parents called Umbrella Housing. and then to London, where Vine joined the NYT (National Youth Theatre of Britain) in 1983, and the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts, London, 1987\\u20131990. They moved to Tooting in 1987 and her son went to a Montessori nursery school. Vine later took her son out of school because he had been bullied and educated him at home.</p>\\n<p>Vine lived with musician Ross Newell, \\\"the love of her life\\\" for over four years, but \\\"stupidly\\\" left him for another relationship; two years later she wanted to restart the relationship with Newell, but he no longer trusted her. In 2004, by which time Newell was settled in a marriage with children, Vine said that he was still her \\\"soul mate\\\". Describing how she decided to become an artist and what inspired her, Vine said a \\\"wonderful ex-boyfriend\\\" called Ross had always told her she should become a painter, and that she had always made \\\"crazy doodles\\\".</p>\\n<h2>Career</h2>\\n<h3>Early work</h3>\\n<p>For five years Vine performed as an actress, touring provincial theatres around the United Kingdom, as well as running her own improvised theatre company, Minx Productions, and playing with her band, Victoria Falls. Vine said it was difficult to tour with a small child but earned her Equity Card by performing with Durham Theatre Company. Amongst other roles, she played Barclay in What The Butler Saw at Theatre Clwyd, The National Theatre of Wales: she was a fan of playwright Joe Orton, whom she discovered at drama school. Vine said she would wake up early and dance to songs by PJ Harvey before improvising around her character to prepare for each day's rehearsals. Vine remembers seeing \\\"wonderful paintings by Gainsborough\\\" whilst rehearsing at Kenwood House, London. In the late 1980s, Vine met the film director Mike Leigh. After seeing Mike Leigh's film <i>Meantime</i>, it became her ambition to direct and act in improvised films. When Vine was in her early twenties she auditioned for him twice.</p>\\n<p>In 1995, she abandoned her ambitions to be an actress and became a hostess in a Mayfair club, where most of the activity was talking, often to elderly men, and \\\"Any negotiation for sexual favours, or your time, or conversation, was very old-fashioned. Very English.\\\" Using the name \\\"Stella Vine\\\", she became a lap dancer. She worked as a stripper at Miranda's and later at the Windmill Club in Soho to pay the rent, whilst living with her son in bedsits. One man she met, whom she described as a \\\"sugar daddy\\\" and with whom she was still in contact in 2007, looked after her for six years, and in 1998 took her to New York, where he introduced her to the Frick Collection. She recalled in 2007 that \\\"the candy coloured\\\" room of Gainsborough proved such a rush of excitement that she had to sit down. Januszczak said that this was the moment Vine \\\"realised how much prettiness was possible in art.\\\"</p>\\n<h3>Painting</h3>\\n<p>Vine's paintings are the most well documented part of her artistic output. She paints in both oil and acrylic with \\\"trademark drips of paint falling from the lips and chin\\\" of her subjects. The themes of Vine's painting focus on memory, nostalgia and fairy tales. Vine frequently draws inspiration from her private life, painting from photographs and her memory. The theme of autobiography first surfaced in Vine's early paintings, created whilst she studied at Hampstead School of Art in the early 2000s. Vine painted her step father, with whom she had a troubled, abusive relationship.</p>\\n\\n<p>Vine developed a \\\"crush\\\" on artist Billy Childish, and attended his music events; in June 2000, she went to a talk given by him and fellow Stuckist co-founder, Charles Thomson, on Stuckism. She met Thomson on 30 May 2001 at the <i>Vote Stuckist</i> show in Brixton, where she exhibited some of her paintings publicly for the first time in the show and formed The Westminster Stuckists group. On 4 June, she took part in a Stuckist demonstration. On 10 July, she renamed her group The Unstuckists. In October, there was a Vine painting in the first Stuckist show in Paris.</p>\\n<p>She had a two-month relationship with Thomson and they married on 8 August 2001 in New York. two days later they had an intense row; she left him and they did not meet again till a week later in London. They split up after about two months, and were divorced in October 2003.</p>\\n\\n<p>In March 2004, Vine claimed to have married him because this had been a condition of his paying off her debts of \\u00a320,000. Thomson said that this had been part of a business arrangement to promote themselves as an art couple, and that there had been no condition of marriage.</p>\\n<p>In October 2006, The Stuckist group show, <i>Go West</i>, at Spectrum London gallery, included two paintings by Thomson, which were \\\"explicit images of his ex-wife.\\\" Vine said she had no comment. In February 2008, Stuckist artist, Mark D (real name Mark Randall) opened a show of satirical paintings based on Vine's work.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Vine's mother, who had been ill with Crohn's disease, died suddenly from bowel cancer around this time which led to Vine's high creative drive and the creation of her darkest paintings. In November 2003 she made the first of her Diana, Princess of Wales paintings and those of teenage girls like Rachel Whitear who suffered tragic deaths. She painted as many as 30 of Diana alone, having become fascinated by conspiracy theories into the Princess' tragic car crash which she had read on the Internet. Vine destroyed many of these paintings soon after they were created. She put them all, apart from one, in a skip as she did not have enough space to dry nor store the wet paintings.</p>\\n<h3>Rosy Wilde Gallery</h3>\\n\\n<p>In 2002 \\u2013 2003, Vine studied Philosophical Aesthetics with Johnathan Lahey Dronsfield at Birkbeck College whilst also attending the course <i>Performance After Warhol</i> with Professor Gavin Butt in 2002, and <i>Women's Work</i> with Kathy Battista at Tate Modern. She said she also found much of her art education through the Serpentine Gallery bookshop and became involved with East London artist-run galleries.</p>\\n\\n<p>In 2003, Vine opened the Rosy Wilde gallery on Whitecross Street in east London, as a space that held exhibitions of contemporary art by emerging artists. Vine lived and worked in a studio above the artist-run gallery whilst her son lived in the basement. The gallery was on the verge of bankruptcy, when Charles Saatchi purchased Vine's painting of Diana, Princess of Wales <i>Hi Paul can you come over I'm really frightened</i>. Thanks to the Saatchi purchase and interest in her work, Vine was able to pay the gallery bills. In mid 2004 Vine moved to Spain and the gallery was sold at auction. In 2006, she re-opened her Rosy Wilde gallery, this time in Wardour Street on the first floor above the first Ann Summers sex shop in Soho, London. The gallery closed some years later.</p>\\n<h3>The Saatchi effect</h3>\\n\\n<p>Art collector Charles Saatchi discovered Vine's painting in a show called <i>Girl on Girl</i> in Cathy Lomax's Transition Gallery. He purchased Vine's painting of Diana, Princess of Wales <i>Hi Paul can you come over I'm really frightened</i>, for \\u00a3600 (Vine had originally wanted to price her paintings at \\u00a3100 each). The painting portrayed the Princess with heavy eyes and blood on from her lips. The work's title came from the thick red text painted across the canvas, a reference to Diana's butler Paul Burrell. The price of her paintings \\\"doubled virtually overnight\\\", and as Saatchi anticipated, much of the media attacked the work in his <i>New Blood</i> exhibition, creating a considerable return in publicity for his investment. Media coverage focused on the controversial nature of the painting, as well as the fact that the painting had been bought for only \\u00a3600 from an unknown artist, who was a single mother and an ex-stripper.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Stella_Vine_2001.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q7607144\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":22421114,\"title\":\"Zoe Mendelson\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Zo\\u00eb Mendelson</b> (born 17 April 1976) is a London-based British artist.

Its borders are Kingsland Road in the east, Southgate Road to the west, the Regent's Canal in the south and Ball's Pond Road to the north.</p>\\n<p>It shares the northern London postal district of N1 with neighbouring Islington, Barnsbury, Canonbury and Hoxton.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>19th century</h3>\\n<p>Until 1820 the area now covered by De Beauvoir Town was open country with a few grand houses. In 1821, stimulated by the opening of the Regent's Canal the previous year, developer and brick maker William Rhodes (1774-1843), a grandfather of Cecil Rhodes, secured a lease for 150 acres (0.61\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) of land from Peter de Beauvoir. Rhodes planned to build residences for the upper classes in a grid pattern, with four squares on diagonal streets intersecting at an octagon. However, work stopped in 1823 when Rhodes was found to have obtained his lease unfairly and after a court case spanning over 20 years the land reverted to the de Beauvoir family in 1834.</p>\\n<p>The delay in building had meant that Rhodes' clientele had since moved on to the new suburbs of the West End. The scheme was scaled down and of the planned squares only the southeastern was built, as De Beauvoir Square, although the diagonals partly survived in Enfield Road, Stamford Road and Ardleigh Road. Occupied in the 1840s by the newly emerging middle classes, the estate was almost wholly residential except around Kingsland Basin and the south-west corner where a factory was leased from 1823.</p>\\n<h3>20th Century</h3>\\n\\n<p>In 1937, due to its easy access to Kingsland Basin, the southeast corner between Downham Road and Hertford Road was re-zoned for industrial use. Soon after all the area south of Downham Road was included. This distinguished it from the north side of Downham Road, which was already zoned for business and acted as a buffer for the mainly residential streets beyond. In 1938 De Beauvoir Crescent was suggested as another business zone to protect housing to the north.</p>\\n<p>In the early 1960s the northern part of De Beauvoir Town between Buckingham Road and Tottenham Road was rebuilt as the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney's Kingsgate estate. In the late 1960s a larger area west of the canal basin, which contained many small factories, made way for the De Beauvoir Estate. The east side of De Beauvoir Square was also rebuilt as the Lockner Road estate.</p>\\n<p>In 1968 the De Beauvoir Town association was formed. The rest of the square with the area bounded by Englefield Road, Northchurch Road, Southgate Road, Hertford Road, and Stamford Road became a conservation area in 1969. This area was later extended to cover most of De Beauvoir Town; the eastern edge, however, is in the Kingsland conservation area.</p>\\n<h2>Notable residents</h2>\\n<p>Edmund Gosse, the poet, the son of naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, lived in the area.</p>\\n<p>De Beauvoir Town was home to William Lyttle (1931\\u20132010), a retired electrical engineer known as the <i>Mole Man of Hackney</i>, who dug a series of tunnels under his 20-room property on the corner of Mortimer Road and Stamford Road. In 2001, his tunnelling caused an 8\\u00a0ft (2.4\\u00a0m) hole to appear in the pavement on Stamford Road. Reports that the tunnelling had started again in 2006 were confirmed when Hackney Council found a network of tunnels and caverns, some 8\\u00a0m (26\\u00a0ft) deep, spreading up to 20m in every direction from his house.</p>\\n<p>In August 2006, the council obtained a court order banning Lyttle from his property. He died in 2010 and the fate of the house, by now derelict and needing a new roof, was thought to be uncertain. On 19 July 2012 the house was sold at auction for \\u00a31.12 million. As of summer 2013, the roofless property on its triangular site was supported by scaffolding and surrounded by a tall corrugated-iron fence.</p>\\n<p>Another notable resident was the architect Graham Parsey, who from the late 1960s with the formation of the DBA (De Beauvoir Association) worked to make the area a GIA (General Improvement Area) and therefore saved it from demolition initially and helped to protect its conserved status.</p>\\n<h2>Elected representatives</h2>\\n<p>The local MP is Meg Hillier.

The new layout was designed by Owen Williams, and the ground became London's fourth greyhound track, staging its first meeting on 7 April 1928.

A graduate of Central St. Martins College of Art and Design and Goldsmiths, University of London, she makes installations which incorporate other artists\\u2019 work alongside a variety of disparate objects. She uses techniques and styles common in archiving and museum display. Macuga's work method is often referred to as cultural archaeology as well as being compared to detective work. Her appropriation-based intervention posed questions about ownership, information flow, the possibility of using this information, as well as about the freedom of interpretation when taking advantage of available sources. Macuga often uses art history as a point of reference. When she is working in a given institution, she starts by looking through its archives.</p>\\n<p>For an exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in 2009, Macuga incorporated a 1955 tapestry version of Picasso\\u2019s 1937 antiwar painting <i>Guernica</i> into a year-long installation about the 1930s-era controversy generated by the painting.

It was founded by Martino Gamper, Kajsa St\\u00e5hl and Maki Suzuki (both from design collective \\u00c5b\\u00e4ke) in 2004 with the publication of the book <i>What Martino Gamper did between two-thousand and two-thousand&amp;four</i>. It produces an irregular number of books per year, as well as limited editions and multiples. Dent-De-Leone has participated in numerous art book fairs including the <i>Whitechapel Art Book Fair</i>, Publish And Be Damned and the <i>Motto</i> art book fair. All of its publications are designed by \\u00c5b\\u00e4ke.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Politics</h2>\\n<p>Dent-de-Leone were inspired by Factory Records early contracts, so that each artist retains the ownership of their back catalogue. They sell direct to individuals and bookshops bypassing the usual model of selling in bulk to book distributors who often take a large percentage of the cover price. Doing this allows Dent-de-Leone to offer a low retail price for their work, and pay a large proportion to the published artist. All profits are directed into making new books. Dent-de-Leone began as a vanity publishing project, but quickly expanded as other artists and designers contacted the publishers attracted by the avant-garde design and the distribution model. The books are intended to disseminate the ideas and aesthetics of the published artists, designers and writers. The free Typeface WAR is available on the website of Dent-de-Leone. WAR is a typeface which deconstructs all the \\\"official\\\" countries' flags (2006) to allow a random redesign of your own country.</p>\\n<h2>Origin of the name</h2>\\n<p>The name Dent-De-Leone is derived from the dandelion, a common plant often cooked during the <i>Social Pasta</i> events created by Martino Gamper and \\u00c5b\\u00e4ke.

She graduated from Canterbury University of Fine Arts in 1998. That same year she moved to the UK where she lives and works.</p>\\n<p>In December 2001 the Bart Wells Institute was established by Luke Gottelier and Francis Upritchard in a large squat in East London. The Bart Wells Institute ran for about two years and exhibitions were curated by artists including Sam Basu, Brian Griffiths, David Thorpe and Harry Pye.</p>\\n<p>Upritchard was short-listed for the Becks Futures prize for an exhibition she made 2003 <i>Save Yourself</i>, a small mummy surrounded by funerary urns which lies on the gallery floor vibrating and moaning. A packet of cigarettes is tucked into its bandages, and a single glass eye can also be seen.</p>\\n<p>In 2005 Upritchard had simultaneous shows in the Andrea Rosen Gallery and Salon 94. The sculpture Torcello, Balata Figures and a selection of found objects were arranged over two large plinths. Sculptures of sloths, monkeys, orrerys and rocks. In 2005 she also won New Zealand's Walters Prize for art, after being shortlisted for her Artspace show Doomed Doomed All Doomed in 2005.</p>\\n<p>It was announced in 2008 that Upritchard, along with Judy Millar, would be New Zealand's representatives at the 2009 Venice Biennale.Upritchard's installation was entitled <i>Save Yourself</i>. This was Upritchards first major installation of furniture with figures. Across thee rooms in Fondazione Claudio Buziol Palazzo, 3 over sized tables which made up the works Long, Lonely and Dancers, with a mix of references including psychedelic culture, hippies, Pieter Bruegel the elder and Erasmus Grasser.</p>\\n<p>In the 2009 show Feierabend at Kate Macgarry, Upritchard showed with the jewellery designer Karl Fritsch and furniture designer Martino Gamper. The show blended craft, design and fine art in a seamless way, to a point where the viewer became unsure of the authorship of each work. Gesumptkunsthandwerk at the Govett Brewster in the show 'Stealing the Senses' was a further exploration of this collaboration. The show was shown again later at Hamish McKay gallery in Wellington. This show included ceramics and bronzes made together by Fritsch Gamper and Upritchard, alongside sculptures and lamps by Upritchard, rings and ornaments by Fritch, furniture and bowls by Gamper.</p>\\n<p>Upritchards first solo museum show in 2009 in Europe was at the Vienna Secession called <i>In die H\\u00f6hle</i> (into the Cave). The show included works combining furniture and figurative sculptures referencing Sol LeWitt, Gustav Klimt, Beethoven Frieze and Weiner Werkstatte. Her second, at Nottingham Contemporary in 2012 was called A Hand of Cards. Also in 2012 she showed at Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Centre, a show called, A Long Wait. In 2013 Upritchard's show Poato Poem  will show in MIMOCA museum in Marugame, Japan.</p>\\n<p>Francis Upritchard is represented in the US by Anton Kern Gallery, in the UK by Kate Macgarry and in New Zealand by Ivan Anthony Gallery.</p>\\n<h2>Publications</h2>\\n<p>In 2004, Nieves published a small artist book of Upritchards Heads of Yesteryear which consisted of 19 drawings of Pakeha severed heads in black and white photocopy, which had a British flag as a cover.

He graduated with a Distinction in 1999 and formed his eponymous menswear label immediately afterwards, subsequently also introducing womenswear. Peter Jensen has regularly shown his collections on the main schedule at London Fashion Week, upon the catwalk and in the form of installations, in a variety of venues. These venues range from Milk Studios New York (2011), ICA Institute for Contemporary Art London (2010), Radiohuset Copenhagen (2008), Queens Ice Bowl London (2005) and Galerie Nikki Diana Marquardt Paris (2001).

The designer lives with his long term partner in Primrose Hill, in North London, in an apartment full of classic Scandinavian furniture, as well as his extensive collections of cushions and books.</p>\\n<h2>Artistic Work Method</h2>\\n<p>Jensen's designs are known for being inventive, playful, colourful and well-made. In terms of inspiration, his work is characterised by a unique mixture of popular culture references and often makes reference to infamous or cult figures. Jensen's women's wear collections are consistently inspired by and named after a female Muse - though Jensen avoids obvious style icons, instead homing-in on popular culture's more marginal or complex females, who are as likely to be eccentric, wanton or even criminal, as they are heroic or overtly chic. As the designer has confirmed, <i>I like to base my collections on strong-headed women.</i> (The Independent).</p>\\n<p>His muses have so far included, among others, Hollywood actress Mary Miles Minter, American photographer Tina Barney, the character Candice Marie from the Mike Leigh film, <i>Nuts In May</i>, Carrie-era Sissy Spacek, disgraced Olympic ice skater Tonya Harding, John Waters' actress Mink Stole, the legendary Helena Rubinstein, collector and more Gertrude Stein, artist Cindy Sherman, singer Nina Simone and even Jensen's own Auntie Jytte, an ardent lover of fashion in the 1970s who ran a chip shop and taxi company in Nuuk, Greenland.</p>\\n<p>When Jensen introduced his well-received debut resort collection in late 2009, it combined his popular rabbit logo with typically left-of-centre references to a 1963 photograph, Triplets, taken by the controversial US photographer Diane Arbus.</p>\\n<h2>Critics' Comments</h2>\\n<p>Jensen has consistently received considerable industry support from many of the most respected international fashion critics, editors and writers:</p>\\n<p>Harriet Quick, Vogue: <i>Cleverly conceived, quirkily humorous clothes.... both distinctive and of the moment.</i> (www.vogue.co.uk)</p>\\n<p>Sarah Mower, Style.com: <i>The light-hearted Peter Jensen experience has become a moment to cherish.

He has worked with high street fashion chain Topshop, Topman, as well as Fred Perry on the brand's recurring Blank Canvas project, in which Jensen re-worked the iconic Harrington jacket as part of a capsule collection.

Jensen won rave reviews for his Spring/Summer 2010 womenswear collection and presentation, which arose as a result of his collaboration with US artist Laurie Simmons. Inspired by her photographs, Jensen initially designed the clothes in scaled-down 'doll' sizes, prior to Simmons photographing them in her customary doll's house environments. The resulting images were thereafter enlarged back to life size, and the results were shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, to a backdrop of Simmons' images.</p>\\n<p>For Spring/Summer 2014, Jensen worked with the artist illustrator Julie Verhoeven on a series of print inspired by the iconic American singer Diana Ross.</p>\\n<h2>Distinctions</h2>\\n<p>Since 2001 Head of Menswear, MA Fashion at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, London, since 2005 Judge, BA Fashion Design Awards, same place.

It is 5 miles (8\\u00a0km) north-east of Charing Cross.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Boundaries</h2>\\n<p>In modern terms, <b>Stoke Newington</b> (informally called <b>Stokey</b> by the local residents ) can be roughly defined by the N16 postcode area (though this also includes parts of Stamford Hill and the almost forgotten district of Shacklewell). Its southern boundary with Dalston is quite ill-defined too, but it was once a well-defined administrative unit. In 1899 the Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington was formed out of the greater part of the parish of that name. The resulting boundaries seem rather anomalous now; the entire eastern side of Stoke Newington High Street and beyond, including Stoke Newington Common, were included in the next door Metropolitan Borough of Hackney, but in fact this area was then part of the parish of Hackney \\u2013 not Stoke Newington \\u2013 and much of it would have been regarded as being in Shacklewell at the time. These apparent oddities became moot when in 1965, the Metropolitan Borough became part of the London Borough of Hackney. Immediately to the south of Stoke Newington is Newington Green, also ill-defined, though originally they were two distinct villages separated by a mile of fields.</p>\\n<p>Throughout all these changes, the core of Stoke Newington, centred around Church Street, has retained its own distinct 'London village' character; indeed, Nikolaus Pevsner confessed that he found it hard to see the district as being in London at all.</p>\\n<h2>Open space</h2>\\n\\n<p>For one small district, Stoke Newington is endowed with a generous amount of open space. To its north, there is the extensive West Reservoir, now a non-working facility, but open for leisure and surrounded by greenspace, at the entrance to which is the architecturally bizarre Castle Climbing Centre, once the main Water Board pumping station. It was originally designed, by William Chadwell Mylne, to look like a towering Scottish castle, and is now much-loved in the area.</p>\\n<p>South of these facilities is Clissold Park, an extensive swathe of parkland complete with a small menagerie, aviary and Clissold Mansion, a Grade II listed building, built for Jonathan Hoare, a local Quaker and brother of Samuel Hoare, in the 1790s.</p>\\n<p>Tracking east from here and past the two Church of England parish churches, both called St Mary's [1] (Stoke Newington strangely decided to retain the old one, unusual in a London parish), leads to Abney Park Cemetery, one of the most splendid and enlightened of Victorian London cemeteries. It is now a nature reserve, a role that it was in many ways originally intended for, as it was set up as an arboretum, but Abney Park became scheduled in 2009 as one of Britain's historic park and garden at risk from neglect and decay. Finally, across the high street to the east is the fragmented Stoke Newington Common. This, however, has its charms, largely due to the extensive and diverse programme of tree planting it has enjoyed in recent years.</p>\\n<h2>Reservoirs</h2>\\n<p>From the 16th century onwards, Stoke Newington has played a prominent role in assuring a water supply to sustain London's rapid growth. Hugh Myddleton's New River runs through the area and still makes a contribution to London's water. Although this originally terminated at the New River Head in Finsbury, since 1946 its main flow has ended at Stoke Newington reservoirs, though a slow ornamental trickle flows past the West Reservoir to go underground for a stretch on Green Lanes, reappearing for a time in Clissold Park only to disappear underground again on its way to Canonbury. The river bank, the New River Path, can be walked for some distance to the north through Haringey and on to its source near Hertford, though not all sections are open.</p>\\n\\n<p>Stoke Newington East and West Reservoirs, to the north of Clissold Park, are quite substantial for urban facilities. Stoke Newington Reservoirs were constructed in 1833 to purify the New River water and to act as a water reserve. As mentioned, the West Reservoir is now a leisure facility, offering sailing, canoeing and other water sports, plus Royal Yachting Association- approved sailing courses. On its western edge stands the former filter house, now set out as a visitor centre with a caf\\u00e9; some of the old hydraulic machinery can be viewed in the main hall. The pumping station at the reservoir gates, converted to a climbing centre in 1995 (as mentioned above) was designed in a distinctive castellated style by Robert Billings under the supervision of William Chadwell Mylne and built in 1854\\u201356.</p>\\n<p>Besides the water board facilities and the New River, Clissold Park also contains two large ornamental lakes, a home to many water birds and a population of terrapins. These lakes \\u2013 purportedly the remains of clay pits dug for the bricks used in the building of Clissold House \\u2013 are all that is left to mark the course of the Hackney Brook, one of London's lost rivers, which once flowed from west to east across Stoke Newington on its way to the River Lea. In flood at this point, the brook was known to span 10 metres. The two lakes are not actually fed from the brook, which has long disappeared into the maze of sewers under London, but from the mains supply \\u2013 ultimately the New River.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>Early</h3>\\n\\n<p>Stoke Newington or 'new town in the wood', has been lightly settled for many hundreds of years, close to larger neighbouring Saxon settlements near the River Lea. In the 19th century it was discovered that Stoke Newington Common and Abney Park Cemetery had been part of a Neolithic working area for axe-making, some examples of which can be seen in the Museum of London.</p>\\n<p>Stoke Newington is recorded as part of the Ossulstone hundred in the county of Middlesex in the Domesday Book of 1086. In the 17th century, for administrative purposes the west of Stoke Newington High Street became part of the new Finsbury division and the east part of the Tower division. Both divisions were in 1889 then incorporated into the County of London.</p>\\n<p>In the Middle Ages and Tudor times, it was a very small village a few miles from the city of London, frequently visited by wayfarers as a pit stop before journeying north, Stoke Newington High Street being part of the Cambridge road (A10). At this date the whole manor was owned by St. Paul's Cathedral and yielded a small income, enough to support part of their work. During the 17th century the Cathedral sold the Manor to William Patten, who became the first Lord of the Manor. His initials 'WP' and the motto 'ab alto' can be seen inscribed above the doorway of the old church next to Clissold Park.</p>\\n<h3>18th century</h3>\\n<p>A century later, it passed to Lady Mary Abney who drew up the first detailed maps of field boundaries and began to lay out a manorial parkland behind today's fire station on Church Street, with the aid of her daughters and Dr Isaac Watts.</p>\\n<h3>19th century</h3>\\n<p>During the early 19th century, as London expanded, the Manor of Stoke Newington was 'enfranchised' to be sold in parcels as freehold land for building purposes. Gradually the village became absorbed into the seamless expansion of London. It was no longer a separate village by the mid-to-late 19th century.</p>\\n<p>Being on the outskirts at this time, many expensive and large houses were built to house London's expanding population of <i>nouveau riche</i> whose journey to the commercial heart of the capital was made possible by the birth of the railways and the first omnibuses. The latter were first introduced into central London in the 1820s by George Shillibeer, following his successful trial of the world's first school bus for William Allen and Susannah Corder's novel Quaker school, Newington Academy for Girls. By the mid-nineteenth century, Stoke Newington had \\\"the largest concentration of Quakers in London\\\", including many who had moved up the A10 from Gracechurch Street meeting house in the City. A meeting house was built in Park Street (now Yoakley Road) by the architect William Alderson, who later designed Hanwell Lunatic Asylum.</p>\\n<p>St Mary's Lodge on Lordship Road, the 1843 home of architect and district surveyor John Young, is the last-surviving of several grand detached houses built in the area around that time for well-off members of the new commuter class. Gibson Gardens, an early example of quality tenement buildings erected for the housing of 'the industrious classes', were built off Stoke Newington High Street in 1880 and still stand today.</p>\\n<p>As a late Victorian and Edwardian suburb, Stoke Newington prospered, and continued in relative affluence and civic pride with its own municipal government until changes brought about by the Second World War.</p>\\n<h3>Early 20th century</h3>\\n<p>Between 1935\\u201337, the curved brick and Portland Stone Town Hall was built for the Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington by J. Reginald Truelove.</p>\\n<h3>Second World War</h3>\\n\\n<p>During World War II, much of the area was damaged in the Blitz and many were made homeless, although the level of destruction was much lower than in those areas of East London further south such as Stepney or Shoreditch or even in next-door Hackney. The death toll was also relatively low: almost three-quarters of civilian deaths being due to one tragic incident on 13 October 1940 when a crowded shelter at Coronation Avenue off the high street received a direct hit. The memorial to all the residents of the Borough who died in the air raids, including local Jewish people, can be seen in Abney Park Cemetery. Like Hackney and Tottenham, Stoke Newington avoided most of the later V-weapon attacks, which fell disproportionately on South London; only a total of seven V-1s and two V-2s hit the borough.</p>\\n<p>Most of the historic buildings at the heart of Stoke Newington survived, at least in a repairable state. Two notable exceptions are the classically grand parish church of West Hackney, St James's, on Stoke Newington Road, which dated from 1824, and St Faith's, a Victorian Gothic church by William Burges. Both were so severely damaged, the former in the October 1940 bombing, and the latter by a flying bomb in 1944, that they were entirely demolished. St James's was replaced after the war by a much more modest structure, St Paul's, which is set well back from the street. Traces of the old church's stonework can still be seen facing Stoke Newington Road.</p>\\n<h3>Postwar developments</h3>\\n<p>After the war a substantial amount of residential housing, particularly to the east of modern Stoke Newington, in Hackney borough at the time, had been either destroyed or left in such a bad state that it was seen by the urban planners of that era as better to demolish it. Postwar redevelopment has replaced many of these areas with large estates, some more successful than others. Much of this residential redevelopment was planned by Frederick Gibberd, the designer of Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral.</p>\\n<h4>Political radicalism and terrorism</h4>\\n<p>Ever a home to radicals, Communist Party meetings were held in the Town Hall in the post-war years. And although Stoke Newington became part of the London Borough of Hackney in 1965, it has never quite lost its own identity. Indeed, following the 1960s, it increasingly became home to a number of squatters, artists, bohemians and also political radicals. Famously, the 'Stoke Newington 8' were arrested on 20 August 1971 at 359 Amhurst Road for suspected involvement in The Angry Brigade bombings.</p>\\n\\n<p>The most famous examples of political terrorism by Stoke Newington residents, none originally from the area, are Patrick Hayes, Jan Taylor and Muktar Said Ibrahim. The first two were convicted of two bombings and had substantial links to the huge lorry bombs of the 1990s. Both were arrested, firing at officers in Walford Road and later sentenced to thirty years imprisonment.</p>\\n<p>The third, Muktar Said Ibrahim, was convicted, as the ring leader, on an indictment of conspiracy to murder. He planted a failed bomb on a 26 bus, which misfired later on the Hackney Road on 21 July 2005. Ibrahim used to work at an off-licence on Amhurst Road. In February 2005, police were seeking Ibrahim on an arrest warrant for an outstanding public order offence and sent a letter to his Farleigh Road address saying \\\"Call us, before we call you.\\\" After the attack, Ibrahim was seen on the run in Farleigh Road and was later arrested in Dalgrano Gardens, W10. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of forty years before being considered for release.</p>\\n<h3>21st century</h3>\\n<p>These days, Stoke Newington is a very multicultural area, with large Asian, Irish, Turkish, Jewish and Afro-Caribbean communities. The area continues to be home to many new and emerging communities such as Polish and Somali immigrants.</p>\\n<p>Stoke Newington has undergone major gentrification, as have neighbouring Newington Green, Canonbury and Dalston. Much of the gentrification of the area has been based around Church Street, where there are many independent shops, pubs, bars and cafes.</p>\\n<p>On Saturday mornings, St Paul's churchyard in Stoke Newington High Street hosts an active farmers' market \\u2013 relocated in July/August 2011 from its earlier site in the playground of William Patten Primary school on Church Street. This was the first farmers' market in the UK to have only organic and biodynamic producers.</p>\\n<p>In June 2011 property developer Newmark Properties LLP announced their proposed development for Wilmer Place. This includes a large Sainsburys supermarket, \\\"high quality private and affordable residential apartments\\\" and a 90+ vehicle car park. This development requires the demolition of some of the existing properties in Wilmer Place and 195\\u2013201 Stoke Newington High Street.

Their mothers became friends and he started a friendship with the two brothers that endures today.</p>\\n<p>His father was headmaster of Vinehall School in Robertsbridge, so both friends were schooled there along with Richard Hughes, who would later be their band mate. With Rice-Oxley and Hughes, Chaplin then attended Tonbridge School. Studying there, they met Dominic Scott (who was an original member of the line-up but left in 2001). During his time at Vinehall, Chaplin acted in several school plays and was part of the school's choral group. He also played the flute while at school.</p>\\n<p>In 1995, the trio (Scott, Rice-Oxley and Hughes) started their first band, The Lotus Eaters. It was a cover band that played U2, Oasis and The Beatles at Sussex pubs. Tim Rice-Oxley invited Chaplin to join the band as an acoustic guitar player. A short time later, in 1997, the band's name changed to Keane and Tom Chaplin became the lead vocalist.</p>\\n<p>It was revealed on <i>Soccer AM</i> in 2010 that Tom is an Ipswich Town fan. Tom is also an avid fan of cricket, supporting both Sussex and the England national team.</p>\\n<p>Tom fulfilled a lifetime ambition of performing with the remaining Queen members at the Prince's Trust Rock Gala, 17 November 2010.

When Hughes went to collect Chaplin a year later, on 3 July 1998, his first words were, <i>\\\"We've got a gig in ten days.\\\"</i> This would be the band's first performance at the Hope &amp; Anchor pub on 13 July 1998. Chaplin then began studying for a degree in art history at the University of Edinburgh, before leaving to pursue his music career in London.</p>\\n<p>During their stint in London, Chaplin shared a flat with Rice-Oxley in Stoke Newington and they tried to get money for rehearsal time.

She served in the Cabinet between 2008 and 2010 under Prime Minister Gordon Brown as Chief Secretary to the Treasury and then as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. She is currently the Shadow Home Secretary. She is married to fellow Labour politician Ed Balls.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life and education</h2>\\n<p>Cooper was born in Inverness, Scotland. Her father was Tony Cooper, former General Secretary of Prospect union, a member of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and a former Chairman of the British Nuclear Industry Forum. She was also a government adviser on the Energy Advisory Panel.</p>\\n<p>She was educated at Eggar's School, a comprehensive school in Holybourne, and Alton College. She went on to study at Balliol College, Oxford, where she was awarded first class honours in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. It was there that she became friends with her future colleague, James Purnell. She gained a Kennedy Scholarship in 1991 to study at Harvard University, and she eventually finished her studies with an MSc in Economics at the London School of Economics.</p>\\n<h2>Early career</h2>\\n<p>She began her career as an economic policy researcher for Shadow Chancellor John Smith in 1990, before spending time working in Arkansas for Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Clinton in 1992. Later that year, she became a policy advisor to Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Harriet Harman and in 1994 moved to become a research associate at the Centre for Economic Performance.

In 2009, Cooper was appointed Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.</p>\\n<h3>Shadow Cabinet</h3>\\n\\n<p>After Labour left government in May 2010, Cooper and her husband Ed Balls were both mentioned in the press as a potential leadership candidates when Gordon Brown resigned as Leader of the Labour Party. Before Balls announced his candidacy, he offered to stand aside if Cooper wanted to stand, but Cooper declined for the sake of their children, stating that it would not be the right time for her. She later topped the 2010 ballot for places in the Shadow Cabinet, and there was speculation that the newly elected Labour Leader Ed Miliband would appoint her Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. She would instead be appointed Shadow Foreign Secretary. When Alan Johnson resigned as Shadow Chancellor on 20 January 2011, Cooper was moved to become the Shadow Home Secretary. Her husband, who had previously served in that role, moved to replace Johnson as Shadow Chancellor.

He is a writer, poet, philosopher, painter, musician and activist. He was a former member of the performance art groups EXIT and Ceres Confusion, and in 1972 was co-founder with Phil Russell aka Wally Hope of the Stonehenge Free Festivals. In 1977, alongside Steve Ignorant, he co-founded the seminal anarchist punk band Crass which disbanded in 1984. From that time up until 2000 he devoted himself almost entirely to writing, returning to the public platform in 2001 as a performance poet working alongside Australian saxophonist Louise Elliott and a wide variety of jazz musicians under the umbrella of Penny Rimbaud's Last Amendment.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Having very early on fallen foul of his father's 'real world', Rimbaud adopted a youthful waywardness which developed later into a committed form of bohemianism. Contemptuous of any authority, he was expelled from two public schools, Brentwood School in South East England and Lindisfarne College in North Wales. Rather than joining the ranks of the unemployed, he elected to study philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford, before quickly realising that, in his own words, 'Oxford wasn't about learning, but about a peculiarly unpleasant form of class indoctrination'.</p>\\n<h2>Name</h2>\\n<p>Ratter's name of choice, Rimbaud, the French symbolist poet, was deed polled in 1977. In his own words he 'wanted to be his own child.' His Oxbridge brother, Anthony, had often referred to him as being 'a toilet-seat philosopher' which prompted him to choose the forename Penny, that being the currency necessary at the time for entry into public toilets. The middle name \\\"Lapsang\\\" was added at the last moment to add what Rimbaud felt was 'a touch of the exotic'.</p>\\n<h3>A life of art</h3>\\n<p>Rimbaud enrolled at the South East Essex Technical College and School of Art in the early 1960s, where he met his lifelong creative partner Gee Vaucher. While there, he was quick to realise the potential within the then fledgling pop art movement, scoring considerable success as an innovator. His works were included in the Northern Young Contemporaries and on the back of this he was offered the possibility of working at Andy Warhol's 'Factory'. He refused on the grounds that he 'had better things to do', something which he claims never to have regretted. In 1964 he appeared on Granada TV's <i>Ready Steady Go!</i> to receive a prize from John Lennon for winning a competition staged by the pop show \\\"Ready Steady Go!\\\" to produce a piece of artwork depicting The Beatles' song \\\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand Rimbaud worked briefly as an art teacher before becoming disillusioned with education and then spent some time working as a coalman.</p>\\n<h3>Words and action</h3>\\n\\n<p>In 1967, inspired by the film <i>Inn of the Sixth Happiness</i>, Rimbaud set up the anarchist/pacifist open house, Dial House, in Essex, UK, which has now become firmly established as a 'centre for radical creativity'. It was from there, in the early seventies, that alongside Phil Russell aka Wally Hope he co-founded the Stonehenge Festival as documented in his autobiography of 1998, 'Shibboleth \\u2013 my revolting life'.</p>\\n<h3>Phil Russell's death and the birth of Crass</h3>\\n<p>As documented in 'Shibboleth', Russell was arrested and incarcerated in a mental institution after having been found in possession of a small amount of LSD. He was later released, but appeared to have been seriously mentally damaged by his experiences, especially the side effects of prescription drugs that he had been administered, and subsequently died. The official verdict is that Russell committed suicide, although Rimbaud claims that he uncovered strong evidence that he was murdered. Rimbaud has also stated that it was his anger over unanswered questions surrounding his friend's death that fuelled and inspired him in 1977 to form Crass, the anarchist punk band whose frequent battles with the authorities, notably the government of Margaret Thatcher, are well documented in Shibboleth.</p>\\n<p>When Crass disbanded in 1984, Rimbaud adopted an almost hermit-like existence, writing and publishing poetry, philosophy, essays, novels and plays. In 2001 he returned to the public platform as a performance poet, firstly working alongside saxophonist Ed Jones and then with Louise Elliott who has now become his full-time accompanist. In 2003, with Crass vocalist Eve Libertine, he founded what at first was the <i>Crass Collective</i>, then the Crass Agenda and finally the Last Amendment. Last Amendment is a loose collective of jazz musicians, artists and filmmakers sharing Rimbaud's lifelong interest in progressive, improvisational art.</p>\\n<h3>Written works</h3>\\n<p>His works include the originally self-published <i>Reality Asylum</i>, a vitriolic attack on Christianity which in heavily revised form was featured on Crass' 1978 debut album <i>The Feeding of the 5000</i>, as a longer single and as a 45-minute spoken word monologue.</p>\\n<p>He also wrote <i>Rocky Eyed</i>, an extended poem attacking then prime minister Margaret Thatcher and her government following the 1982 Falklands War which was recorded as the Crass album <i>Yes Sir, I Will</i>, <i>The Death of Imagination</i> (a 'musical drama in 4 parts'), <i>The Diamond Signature</i> (published by AK Press) and <i>Oh America</i>, a response to the September 11, 2001 attacks and America's subsequent War on Terror which includes the line <i>Give us justice which is not the searing spite of revenge, peace which is not the product of war nor dependent upon it</i>.</p>\\n<h2>Current work</h2>\\n\\n<p>Since 2003 he has worked as part of Crass Agenda (later Last Amendment), performing live and releasing CDs. Titles include <i>Savage Utopia</i>, a collaboration with Coldcut's Matt Black and other jazz musicians, and <i>How?</i>, a reworking of Allen Ginsberg's beat poem <i>Howl</i>, recorded live at the Vortex Jazz Club.</p>\\n<p>During 2005 Rimbaud completed a philosophical work \\\"This Crippled Flesh\\\" (first and second editions published by Bracketpress, 2010), as well as appearing in Dominic Thackray's short film <i>Girlfriend in a Kimono</i>.</p>\\n<p>He has written introductions to books including the controversial <i>The Evil Empire: 101 Ways That England Ruined the World</i> and in 2007 was working on a \\\"Jazz Requiem\\\" with saxophonist Ed Jones.

Samuel Oughton</b> (1803 \\u2013 December 1881), Baptist missionary to Jamaica 1836-1866, and colleague of William Knibb, was an ardent slavery abolitionist who became an outspoken advocate of black labour rights in Jamaica during the gradual abolition of slavery in the late 1830s and thereafter. He was briefly imprisoned in Jamaica during 1840. Originally associated with James Sherman's Independent Congregational Surrey Chapel, and from time to time invited back by Sherman, he was closely associated with the Baptists in Jamaica, who were largely organised along Congregational lines and among the predominantly African-Caribbean population, following their founding by George Lisle, a former slave from America.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life in Jamaica</h2>\\n<p>Samuel Oughton's work for the Baptist Missionary Society in Jamaica, soon became well known. Arriving in 1836 from the Surrey Chapel in London, his posting was initially to help Thomas Burchell, a relative by marriage. However, by 1839 he was invited by the largely African congregation in Kingston to be their pastor at the prominent East Queen Street chapel.</p>\\n<p>This was a key time in the emancipation of Jamaican slaves. After \\\"legal abolition\\\" began in Jamaica with the home government's Emancipation Act of 1833, conditions were little better for many Africans in Jamaica for some decades; particularly under the dreaded \\\"indentured apprenticeship\\\" system of forced labour, which was taken to extremes by the Planters, some masters and their overseers compelling the use of treadmills.</p>\\n<p>The abuses of indentured apprenticeship were finally abolished on 1 August 1838, following a campaign led by Joseph Sturge, with support from the Baptists, the Anti-Slavery Society, and longstanding abolitionists such as William Allen. Even so, emancipation was no paradise; the planters frequently harassed tenants (see Free Villages, and sought to drive down wages when they could. Oughton once famously remarked to his flock in the parish of Hanover:</p>\\n<p>For a time (during 1840) he was imprisoned by the Jamaican authorities for his outspoken views against liberties being taken by magistrates against African women. Back in Britain, Joseph Sturge of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society passed on Oughton's descriptions of the horrendous labour practices suffered by Africans in Jamaica, which Oughton continued to communicate whilst in prison. Joseph Sturge made representations to the Colonial Office on his behalf and Samuel Oughton was eventually discharged after a period released on bail. He records \\\"simple but ardent expressions of delight and affection\\\" from \\\"our poor dear people\\\", who welcomed him back to East Queen Street chapel with renewed hope. In 1841 Oughton was able to write: \\\"my affection for the people, and theirs for me, seems to grow stronger by the day\\\".</p>\\n<p>The Baptist returns at about this date show Samuel Oughton, assisted by George Rowse, to be responsible for three \\\"sub stations\\\", two \\\"day schools\\\", two \\\"Sunday schools\\\", and, besides Rowse, two further teachers - Miss Simpson, and W.Spraggs.</p>\\n<h2>Oughton's moral code</h2>\\n<p>In the 1844 elections Oughton was active in promoting African candidates, and most of his congregation were of African origin. He stayed at East Queen Street chapel as pastor for the next twenty years, although not without incident since he promoted a form of moral code that he applied to everyone, including the emancipated citizens whose status he had been invited to improve.</p>\\n<p>The legal status of one Baptist chapel was often slightly different from another since they had grown up in many ways. At one time George Lisle's chapel was his personal responsibility, and he was imprisoned for an outstanding debt on its construction. The more appropriate scheme of ownership was through some form of trust deed. Whilst Oughton supported the congregation's right to appoint trustees at one Chapel where this issue arose, the wish of his own congregation to do likewise at the East Queen Street Chapel became a cause of controversy since it had a different constitution. Oughton also faced a problem because all its trustees but one had died before dutifully appointing others, and so it became inquorate. Just as he had exposed wrongdoing by the magistrates, and been prepared to suffer imprisonment for a time, he would not be party to illegal ownership arrangements at his chapel whatever the price. A number of his congregation would have been happy with this however, and put pressure on the remaining trustee to exceed his legal authority. Oughton's firm moral standards upset them; he again had to pay the price of unpopularity, just as when he had upset sections of the white population earlier.</p>\\n<p>In the 1860s Oughton departed from religion and education slightly, though in his inimitable moralistic way. He wrote two books in which he tried to promote a theory, originally popular with some French and English thinkers in \\\"The Enlightenment\\\" period, that a population must 'want' artificial things to create drive and hard work, and therefore increasing wealth. In such a seductively warm and fertile island as Jamaica, Oughton contended, this might not happen; people might content themselves after reaching a certain standard of living.</p>\\n<h2>The Jamaican Baptists and emancipation</h2>\\n<p>The Baptist missions on Jamaica were closely involved in emancipation and reform. The mission was founded by the African George Lisle a former slave from America. Their churches on Jamaica promoted the slave Samuel Sharpe (1801\\u201332) to Deacon at the Burchell Baptist Church in Montego Bay, and later the African Paul Bogle (1822\\u20131865), believed to have been born free, to Deacon in Stony Gut, north of Morant Bay.</p>\\n<p>There was progress, too in encouraging political and social involvement of women. Positions of responsibility such as \\\"assistant class leader\\\", \\\"class leader\\\", and above, were open to all who had the necessary reading and writing skills; men and women. One of the Baptist's cherished principles was of church self-government in which everyone was entitled to vote in elections and petitioning, which provided the first opportunity for many in the community to have their voice heard. This was one of the earliest routes through which the labouring poor began to have political influence. Progress was sometimes painfully slow, however, particularly for those who sought immediate self-government. At Samuel Oughton's chapel, Eleanor Vickars, an African assistant class-leader whose father is believed to have been a deacon, successfully stood for election as class-leader but did not meet the literacy requirement necessary for confirmation of her appointment. Samuel Oughton had to decide between the Baptist's cherished principles of self-government or upholding the literacy entry requirements arising from the hope that education would be \\\"the great leveller\\\". In the event, he avoided setting a precedent and called for both beliefs to be upheld equally, a route that did successfully lead to self-determination by African congregations.</p>\\n<p>It has been noted that female literacy was strongly encouraged by the Baptist Missionary Society. In 1841 the <i>Baptist Herald and Friend of Africa</i> was able to report thirty-six female teachers and over 2,000 girls in day schools. Back in Britain a training school for female teachers was also established; at Kettering.</p>\\n<h2>Burial</h2>\\n<p>Samuel Oughton's second wife, Sarah (1819\\u20131882), was sister of the wealthy British doctor and baptist, Nathaniel Rogers MD. Samuel Oughton died in London in December 1881 and is buried along with Sarah, each with a memorial plaque, in the Rogers' Family Mausoleum at Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington. Samuel's first wife was Hannah, a niece of Hester Burchell, who was the wife of Thomas Burchell.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Nathaniel_Rogers_MD.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q7412322\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":1368044,\"title\":\"Michael Levy, Baron Levy\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Michael Abraham Levy, Baron Levy</b>, (born 11 July 1944) is President of Community Service Volunteers (CSV) Jewish Care, Jewish Free School (JFS) and Jewish Lads' and Girls' Brigade (JLGB).</p>\\n<p>Levy is a Labour member of the House of Lords and was the chief fundraiser for the UK Labour Party.

One of his formative musical experiences came from seeing guitarist Guthrie Govan playing in the school's inter-house music competition. Tom went on to develop a friendship with Govan which continues to this day. Tom joined his first band at the age of 12, a Metallica influenced thrash metal group consisting of several other pupils from the school. Over subsequent years Tom played bass guitar in various local bands playing numerous gigs around East Anglia and London, and took part in some studio recordings.</p>\\n<p>In 1991 Tom became interested in house music, hardcore, acid house and techno, through which he became friends with Hardy Finn who went on to co-found record label Spymania.</p>\\n<h2>Career</h2>\\n<h3>1994: <i>Stereotype EP</i> (As Stereotype)</h3>\\n<p>In August 1993, Tom recorded a particular piece named \\\"O'Brien\\\". The cassette containing this recording is visible on the front cover of the <i>Buzz Caner</i> album and is dated 8/8/93 &gt; 11/8/93. This piece was particularly liked by Tom's friend Hardy Finn and between them they raised sufficient funds to release this piece, along with additional material, on a vinyl 12\\\". The name of the record label (which was effectively formed by Tom And Hardy) was \\\"Nothing's Clear\\\", taken from the title of a song by Tricky of which Tom and Hardy were fans, released in 1991 on a compilation album called <i>The Hard Sell.\\\"</i></p>\\n<p>This record exhibits a strong influence of Aphex Twin, and Tom states that the \\\"Xylem Tube E.P.\\\" was of particular importance to him at that time. \\\"Falling\\\" was written immediately after Tom listened to 'Galaxy' by Carl Craig, and was completed the following day after an all-night recording session, which set the precedent of how he would work in the future. Tom and his friends took the copies of the record to various local record shops but found reactions disappointing.</p>\\n<p>However, it was played by Colin Faver on Kiss FM, and elicited a complimentary phone call from Grant Wilson Claridge of Rephlex Records. These tracks featured in the live sets which Tom was playing during this period, which included a performance at Eurobeat 2000 at Turnmills in 1995, where he shared the bill with one of his influences, Carl Craig.</p>\\n<h3>1995: The first Squarepusher releases</h3>\\n<p>In autumn 1994, Tom began to pursue his fascination for integrating breakbeats into electronic music. This was partly inspired by early 1990s recordings on record labels such as Shut Up And Dance, Chill, D-Zone and Kickin', but also Aphex Twin's usage of breaks in tracks such as \\\"Polynomial C\\\" and \\\"Dodeccaheedron\\\" as well as Renegade Soundwave's \\\"Black Eye Boy\\\" and Mantronix's \\\"King of the Beats\\\", which had been a favourite of Tom's from the days of DJ'ing at parties in Chelmsford.</p>\\n<p>The first recordings using Tom's new set up were released on the Spymania label. This was an offshoot of Zoom Records, which was based in Camden Town and was set up by Tom's school friends Hardy Finn and Paul Fowler who worked at Zoom. The first e.p. was called \\\"Conumber\\\". \\\"Conumber\\\" exhibits the influence of mid-1990s jungle, which at that point had eclipsed his interest in other forms of dance music. Tom cites \\\"Babylon\\\" by DJ Splash, \\\"Dub Plate Style\\\" by Marvellous Kane and \\\"R.I.P.\\\" by Remarc as being particularly influential on him. But a very specific influence came from Luke Vibert's recordings as Plug, especially the track \\\"Military Jazz\\\" from the \\\"Plug 2\\\" e.p. of which he says: \\\"I recall hearing that on the radio in the summer of 1995. I was dumbfounded, I thought I was listening to some funk group and suddenly this massive Amen breakbeat kicked in. It sounded like the future.\\\" This influence came to fuel many of Tom's ideas over the next two years, in particular the album <i>Hard Normal Daddy</i> and becomes more apparent on the second Spymania e.p. \\\"Alroy Road Tracks.\\\" Another influence at this time came from frequenting the club \\\"Speed\\\", which was put on by DJ's Fabio and LTJ Bukem and was held in central London.</p>\\n<p>The e.p. received an excellent reaction from Rocket at Ambient Soho on Berwick Street, who was sufficiently enthused to invite Tom to play a live set at his monthly club night held in the backroom of The George Robey pub in Finsbury Park. Tom had already attended several nights at this particular club, which was known for playing experimental electronic music. Sharing the bill with Jenkinson were Wishmountain aka Matthew Herbert and Cylob. The sleeve notes of <i>Feed Me Weird Things</i> written by Aphex Twin recall to humorous effect some of the real or imagined occurrences of that evening which marked the beginning of a friendship between him and Tom.</p>\\n<p>The second release on Spymania was under the pseudonym of \\\"Alroy Road Tracks\\\" and was entitled \\\"Featuring The Duke of Harringay\\\". The meeting with Rocket at Ambient Soho resulted in two releases on the Worm Interface label, which operated out of the Ambient Soho shop. These were two tracks on \\\"Dragon Disk 2\\\" and the \\\"Bubble and Squeak\\\" e.p.</p>\\n<p>At this time, Tom was becoming obsessed with bringing a \\\"dark psychedelia\\\" to Drum and Bass, which would eventually reach its zenith with <i>Go Plastic</i> from 2001. During this period Tom also made a remix for Ninja Tune's DJ Food, which featured on the e.p. \\\"Refried Food\\\". The remix led Ninja Tune to offer Jenkinson a record contract, which along with an offer from Belgium's R&amp;S records he declined in favour of a contract offered by Warp Records, which was partially instigated by Richard D. James. Correspondence between Richard D. James and Tom Jenkinson sprung up after meeting at The George Robey. The resulting meeting led to Tom's first hearing of the <i>Hangable Auto Bulb</i> e.p. which Richard had brought with him. But the meeting also facilitated Richard's initial selection of Tom's tracks that went on to form the <i>Feed Me Weird Things</i> album released on Rephlex Records in 1996.</p>\\n<h3>1995\\u201396: <i>Feed Me Weird Things</i></h3>\\n<p>Jenkinson was offered a five album record contract with Warp Records in December 1995, which was duly signed, and this led him to defer his studies at Chelsea Art College. Early in 1996 Richard D. James completed the compilation process for <i>Feed Me Weird Things</i> which was made from over 50 tracks that Tom had given him on DAT, which were recorded from late 1994 to 1995. Around the same time Richard and Tom recorded two tracks together, one of which was subsequently edited by Tom and released as \\\"Freeman Hardy &amp; Willis Acid\\\" on the <i>We Are Reasonable People</i> compilation album in 1998. Tom's contribution to the other track was reinterpreted and released as \\\"Happy Little Wilberforce\\\" on the <i>Alt. Frequencies</i> compilation released on Worm Interface in 1996. 1996 saw Jenkinson starting to be offered gigs both in the UK and in continental Europe.</p>\\n<p>Early that year Tom made the acquaintance of Talvin Singh who offered him a slot at his club night \\\"Anokha\\\" held at the Blue Note Club in Hoxton Square, London. Tom and Talvin went on to play together on several occasions during this period including improvised sessions at the end of the night at Anokha, one of which featured guitarist Guthrie Govan, and also at the first Big Chill Festival in 1996.</p>\\n<p>Shortly after the release of <i>Feed Me Weird Things</i> came \\\"Port Rhombus\\\" which was Tom's first release on Warp Records. The title track actually started life as a remix of a track by Ken Ishii, commissioned by R&amp;S Records in Belgium. However the remix was rejected on the basis of it having insufficient similarity to Ken's piece. \\\"Significant Others\\\" uses the DR660 drum machine running through a spring reverb that Tom found at a jumble sale.</p>\\n<h3>1996\\u201397: <i>Hard Normal Daddy</i></h3>\\n<p>Using the same equipment from the sessions that produced the majority of <i>Feed Me Weird Things</i> Tom now set about working on the material for his first album for Warp. His broad conception for this record was \\\"to push away from the jazz influence that was being felt at the time to a more soundtrack-type of sound\\\". According to Tom he was listening to, amongst other things, early Lalo Schifrin and the \\\"Deathwish\\\" soundtrack by Herbie Hancock around this time. That said, the album also contains some abrupt diversions into quite different musical territory, evidenced in what Tom calls the \\\"Industrial Psychedelia\\\" of \\\"Chin Hippy\\\" and \\\"Rustic Raver\\\".</p>\\n<p>Tom's electric bass work becomes very apparent on this record. He states that he was \\\"still battling with the influence of Pastorius.\\\" He wanted to \\\"make the styles interrogate each other, such that one track would question the premises of another and vice versa. As such I suppose it might indicate tentativeness, but in my mind at the time I liked the idea of bringing musical assumptions into question by smashing stylistically divergent elements into each other\\\". In this he follows a precedent set by Frank Zappa, whom Tom claims is \\\"always hovering in the background\\\" for him.</p>\\n<p>The sleeve artwork was generated from a set of images taken by Tom wandering about Chelmsford town centre. The front cover image is based on a view of the Gasometers situated at Wharf Road, near where he lived as a teenager. The 8-bit graphics reflect Tom's resurgence of interest in old video consoles and home computers at that time. This location was subsequently used in some of the press shots in the <i>Hello Everything</i> promotional campaign.</p>\\n<h3>1997: <i>Big Loada</i></h3>\\n<p>In January 1997, Tom moved to a flat in Albion Road in Stoke Newington, London. This particular residence was shown in the Jockey Slut \\\"All Back to Mine\\\" article from that year and it was also where Tom's appearance in the \\\"xxx\\\" documentary was filmed. Of this era, Tom states that he was \\\"having dreams about the end of the world, alien invasions and catastrophic events almost every night. It was a strange time, quite literally nightmarish.\\\"</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Squarepusher.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q553861\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1}],\"lon\":-0.0731,\"wikidata\":\"Q2483346\",\"lat\":51.5615,\"pageid\":94303,\"ns\":0,\"type\":\"city\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":1728.3,\"title\":\"Newington Green Unitarian Church\",\"extract\":\"<p><b>Newington Green Unitarian Church (NGUC)</b> in north London is one of England's oldest Unitarian churches. It has had strong ties to political radicalism for over 300 years, and is London's oldest Nonconformist place of worship still in use. It was founded in 1708 by English Dissenters, a community of which had been gathering around Newington Green for at least half a century before that date. The church belongs to the umbrella organisation known as the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, and has had an upturn in its fortunes since the turn of the millennium.</p>\\n<p>Its most famous minister was Dr Richard Price, a political radical who is remembered for his role in the Revolution Controversy, a British debate about the French Revolution, but who also did pioneering work in finance and statistics. The most famous member of its congregation was Mary Wollstonecraft, who drew inspiration from Price's sermons in her work, both in arguing for the new French republic and in raising the issue of the rights of women.</p>\\n<p>The building, which faces the north side of the green, was extended in 1860, and was listed in 1953. It lies within the London Borough of Hackney, although the rest of the green is part of the London Borough of Islington.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Background to its creation</h2>\\n<p>After the end of Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth and the Restoration of Charles II, those in England and Wales who were not members of the Church of England found themselves in an uncomfortable position. Several pieces of legislation, known collectively as the Clarendon Code, made their lives difficult. The first restricted public office to Anglicans. The Act of Uniformity the following year was a step too far for many clergymen, and about 2,000 of them left the established church in the Great Ejection of 1662. The third act forbad unauthorised religious meetings of more than five people. The final one prohibited Nonconformist clergymen from living within five miles of a parish from which they had been banned. Where the ministers went, their flocks tended to follow. Some of these restrictions were ameliorated a generation later, with the passing of the Act of Toleration 1689, which guaranteed freedom of worship for certain groups. It allowed Nonconformists (or Dissenters) their own places of worship and their own teachers and preachers, subject to certain oaths of allegiance and to the registering of these locations and leaders, but it perpetuated their existing social and political disabilities, including their exclusion from political office and also from universities (Oxford and Cambridge were the only universities in England and Wales at that time).</p>\\n<p>Roman Catholics were specifically targeted by these acts, and many of them went underground. Some Christians who had hoped for a more Protestant Reformation within the Established Church chose to emigrate, especially to the American colonies, as the Pilgrim Fathers had done in 1620. Others maintained their faith openly, and lived with the restrictions the state placed upon them, moving to areas where they were tolerated. Often they set up educational establishments, known in general as dissenting academies, which were intellectually and morally more rigorous than the universities. One such was at Newington Green, then an agricultural village a few miles from London, but now within Inner London. Unitarianism or Rational Dissent\\u00a0\\u2013 \\\"that intellectual aristocracy in the ranks of Dissent, as historians often characterise it\\\"\\u00a0\\u2013 had an obvious affinity with education, critical enquiry, and challenges to the <i>status quo</i>, and is \\\"one of the roots of modern English Culture\\\". A critical mass of such people, including \\\"dissident intellectuals, pedagogues with reforming ideas and Dissenters\\\" and \\\"the well-to-do edge of radical Protestantism\\\" clustered around Newington Green. Not all of these free-thinkers were Unitarians, such as Quaker John Coakley Lettsome (physician, philanthropist, and abolitionist) or the Anglicans Vicesimus Knox (pacifist and writer) and George Gaskin (minister and long-time secretary of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge), but most had some connections to the chapel on the green.</p>\\n<h2>The building and its religious neighbours</h2>\\n\\n<p>The original 1708 building was financed with \\u00a3300 from goldsmith Edward Harrison, equivalent to about \\u00a342,100 as of 2014. He leased it to the trustees of the congregation, who furnished it with pulpit, pews, and so on, raising the necessary \\u00a396 from about 20\\u00a0subscribers, primarily by hiring or selling pews. It was a \\\"substantial brick building, of nearly square form, with the high, tiled, projecting roof, common at its era\\\", \\\"Historic views show that the original fa\\u00e7ade had a small pediment against a large hipped roof, with a central oval window below.\\\" It was too plain for Wollstonecraft's Anglican tastes, and one of her biographers thought it defiantly stark. This building was substantially extended and improved in the mid-nineteenth century. An internal gallery was built to increase the seating available, and a few years later the roof and apse were renewed, and a \\\"stuccoed frontage\\\" was built, \\\"mirroring the original fa\\u00e7ade with a three-bay front with two round-headed windows, but with added Tuscan pilasters and a large pediment\\\". In the mid-twentieth century, the building was damaged by enemy action. In 1953 its architectural importance was recognised as a Grade II listed building.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Other religious institutions existed nearby. St Matthias, one of London's foremost High Churches, was built a couple of hundred yards away between 1849 and 1853, partly with money from a rich doctor named Robert Brett, who thought that the Dissenting chapels were attracting so many worshippers in part because the Anglican pews were full. Jews fleeing the pogroms of the Russian Empire established a congregation in the area by 1876, and built the Dalston Synagogue in adjoining Poets Road in 1885. This Victorian Gothic building became one of the leading synagogues of London, with Jacob Koussevitzsky as its cantor from 1936. Fronting onto the green itself was the China Inland Mission headquarters (circa 1895), an organisation responsible for 18,000\\u00a0converts to Christianity that had been founded by James Hudson Taylor at the height of the Victorian era. St Matthias still operates as a church; the synagogue was demolished in the 1970s; the missionary building is now international student housing.</p>\\n<p>Newington Green fell within the old parish boundaries of Stoke Newington. Although the latter village, centred on Church Street, was a mile away from the hamlet of the Green, across farmland or along the ancient drovers' road of Green Lanes, the two places had and still have a close connection. From the mid-1640s to the mid-1650s, Stoke Newington's parish church was led by Thomas Manton, \\\"a principal person among the non-conformist ministers\\\",; a staunch and popular defender of Reformed principles, he participated in the Westminster Assembly, acted as chaplain to Oliver Cromwell, and preached before Parliament on several occasions. Another Dissenting meeting house was built in Stoke Newington about 1700, near the house of Mary Abney, who had inherited the manor. Later that century the village became known for its Quaker inhabitants; their meeting house was designed by the architect William Alderson. In 1858 the medieval parish church of St Mary was supplemented by an impressive Victorian Gothic building opposite, by Sir George Gilbert Scott. In addition to the buildings, Stoke Newington was remarkable for its range of social reforms, from its connections to the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade to the foundation of the innovative Newington Academy for Girls.</p>\\n<p>As the NGUC lacks its own cemetery, some of its congregants, such as the poet and banker Samuel Rogers, are buried in St Mary's churchyard. However, as the Church of England normally limits its cemeteries to its members, most of the Newington Green Unitarians opted for Bunhill Fields until the middle of the nineteenth century, and then Abney Park Cemetery thereafter. (Robert Southey called the former the Campo Santo of the Dissenters, but the phrase was used for both.) Wollstonecraft was married and later buried at St Pancras Old Church a few miles away.</p>\\n<h2>Earliest years: to the mid-eighteenth century</h2>\\n<p>Newington Green Unitarian Church has been associated with many historically significant people on both sides of the pulpit, especially but not exclusively in the eighteenth century. Charles Morton (1626\\u20131698), the great educator who ended his career as vice-president of Harvard University, ran an influential Dissenting Academy, \\\"probably on the site of the current Unitarian church\\\". One of his friends, James Ashurst, founded a group that worshipped in private houses licensed for the purpose, and, in time, this small congregation decided to build a proper meeting house. (It is worth mentioning here the early religious evolution of this church. It started as Presbyterian, with views on the Trinity as orthodox as those held by the Church of England. In fact, several of its first ministers chose to conform, i.e. rejoin, the established church: one of these was Richard Biscoe, who gave the Boyle Lectures in the late 1730s. However, NGUC soon acquired ministers who were Arian, that is, who denied the Trinity, although they retained their belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ. Thus was the Unitarian nature of the church created. In the mid-nineteenth century it was described by a local historian as a Socinian Independent meeting house.) The author Daniel Defoe, who attended school at Newington Green, is believed to have attended the church. Isaac Watts, the \\\"Father of English Hymnody\\\", theologian, logician, and educator, was brought up as a non-Conformist, lived from 1736-1748 at Abney Park nearby, and during that period \\\"was known to have adopted decidedly Unitarian opinions\\\", so he too may have attended NGUC. Samuel Wright, son of a nonconformist minister in Nottinghamshire, writer on theological issues and \\\"a very eminent divine among the Presbyterians\\\" lived at Newington Green until his death in 1746. Several of the church's ministers were at the same time, or had been, the librarians at the theological collection known as Dr Williams's Library, an establishment still very much alive.</p>\\n<h2>Later eighteenth century: the voices heard round the world</h2>\\n<h3>Richard Price</h3>\\n\\n<p>The minister whose name is still remembered centuries later is Dr Richard Price, a libertarian and republican who cemented the village's \\\"reputation as a centre for radical thinkers and social reformers\\\". He arrived in 1758 with his wife Sarah, and took up residence in No. 54 the Green, in the middle of a terrace even then a hundred years old. (The building still survives as London's oldest brick terrace, dated 1658.) In that house, or the church itself, he was visited by Founding Fathers of the United States such as Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Paine; other American politicians such as John Adams, who later became the second president of the United States, and his wife Abigail; British politicians such as Lord Lyttleton, the Earl of Shelburne, Earl Stanhope (known as \\\"Citizen Stanhope\\\"), and even the Prime Minister William Pitt; philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith; agitators such as prison reformer John Howard, gadfly John Horne Tooke, and husband and wife John and Ann Jebb, who between them campaigned on expansion of the franchise, opposition to the war with America, support for the French Revolution, abolitionism, and an end to legal discrimination against Roman Catholics; writers such as poet and banker Samuel Rogers; and clergyman-mathematician Thomas Bayes, known for Bayes' theorem.</p>\\n<p>Price was fortunate in forming close friendships among his neighbours and congregants. One was Thomas Rogers, father of the above, a merchant turned banker who had married into a long-established Dissenting family and lived at No. 56 the Green. More than once, Price and the elder Rogers rode on horseback to Wales. Another was the Rev. James Burgh, author of <i>The Dignity of Human Nature</i> and <i>Thoughts on Education</i>, who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to Price's sermons. Price, Rogers, and Burgh formed a dining club, eating at each other's houses in rotation. When in 1770 Price became morning preacher at the Gravel Pit Chapel in Homerton, he continued his afternoon sermons at NGUC.</p>\\n\\n<p>And there were many at a distance who acknowledged their debt to Price, such as the Unitarian theologians William Ellery Channing and Theophilus Lindsey, and the formidable polymath and Dissenting clergyman, Joseph Priestley, discoverer of oxygen. When Priestley's support of dissent led to the riots named after him, he fled Birmingham and headed for the sanctuary of Newington Green, where Rogers took him in.</p>\\n<p>The support Price gave to the revolt of the colonies of British North America, arguing that the American Revolution was justified, made his name as a famous or notorious preacher. He rejected traditional Christian notions of original sin and moral punishment, preaching the perfectibility of human nature, and he wrote on theological questions. However, his interests were wide-ranging, and during the decades Price spent as minister of NGUC, he also wrote on finance, economics, probability, and life insurance, being inducted into the Royal Society in recognition of his work. On the 101st anniversary of the Glorious Revolution, he preached a sermon titled \\\"A Discourse on the Love of our Country\\\", thus igniting a so-called \\\"pamphlet war\\\" known as the Revolution Controversy, furiously debating the issues raised by the French Revolution. Burke's rebuttal \\\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\\" attacked Price, whose friends Paine and Wollstonecraft leapt into the fray to defend their mentor. The reputation of Price for speaking without fear of the government on these political and philosophical matters drew huge crowds to the church, and were published and sold as pamphlets (i.e. publications easily printed and circulated).</p>\\n<h3>Mary Wollstonecraft</h3>\\n\\n<p>Arguably the congregant Price most influenced was the early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who moved her fledgling school for girls from Islington to the Green in 1784, with the help of a \\\"fairy godmother\\\" whose good auspices found her a house to rent and twenty students to fill it. Her patron \\u2014 or matron \\u2014 was the well-off Mrs Burgh, widow of the educationalist, who treated her almost as a daughter. The new arrival attended services at NGUC: she was a lifelong Anglican, but, in keeping with the church's and Price's ethos of logical enquiry and individual conscience, believers of all kinds were welcomed without any expectation of conversion. The approach of these Rational Dissenters appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women, and in her hour of need proved kinder to her than her own family. She, an unmarried woman making her own way in the world, was marginal to the dominant society in just the same way that the Dissenters were.</p>\\n<p>Wollstonecraft was then a young schoolmistress, as yet unpublished, but Price saw something in her worth fostering, and became a friend and mentor. Through the minister (and through the young Anglican John Hewlett, who also introduced her to the eminent lexicographer Samuel Johnson), she met the great humanitarian and radical publisher Joseph Johnson, who was to guide her career and serve as a father figure. Through him, with a title alluding to the husband of her other benefactor, she published <i>Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</i> (subtitled: <i>with reflections on female conduct, in the more important duties of life</i>). The ideas Wollstonecraft ingested from the sermons at NGUC pushed her towards a political awakening. A couple of years after she had had to leave Newington Green, these seeds germinated into <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Men</i>, a response to Burke's denunciation of the French Revolution and attack on Price. In 1792 she published the work for which she is best remembered, <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>, in the spirit of rationalism extending Price's arguments about equality to women: Her biographer Claire Tomalin argues that just as the Dissenters were \\\"excluded as a class from education and civil rights by a lazy-minded majority\\\", so too were women, and the \\\"character defects of both groups\\\" could be attributed to this discrimination.</p>\\n<h3>Joseph Towers</h3>\\n\\n<p>It would have been hard for anyone to step into the shoes of Dr Price, but the minister from 1778 to his death in 1799 was a remarkable character in his own right. Joseph Towers was born in about 1738, the son of a poor bookseller, and was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Goadby of Sherborne. Lacking formal education, he read all he could and educated himself, eventually writing learned works such as <i>Criminal Libel and the Duty of Juries</i>, and being awarded a Doctor of Law degree by Edinburgh University. Towers assisted fellow minister Andrew Kippis in developing the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>, a forerunner of the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>. He was secretary of the highly respectable Society for Constitutional Information, which lobbied for political liberties, but it was suppressed by the authorities, who lived in fear of the Reign of Terror crossing the Channel. Towers was put under arrest until the Archbishop of Canterbury intervened on his behalf.</p>\\n<h2>Early nineteenth century: The Barbaulds</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1808, Rochemont Barbauld was appointed minister, first as the morning preacher. His wife, Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743\\u20131825), was a prolific writer, admired by Samuel Johnson and William Wordsworth. She enjoyed a long friendship with Joseph Priestley and William Enfield, starting from their years together at the Warrington Academy in the 1760s, where her father John Aikin was tutor. She wrote poems (including a tribute to Priestley), hymns, children's literature, and political and religious tracts. She was an abolitionist, addressing one of her works to William Wilberforce. 1793 saw her contribution to the Pamphlet War, \\\"Sins of the Government, Sins of the Nation\\\". Two years later she wrote <i>The Rights of Women</i>, but this was not published until her death thirty years later.</p>\\n<p>Rochemont eventually went violently insane, attacked his wife, and committed suicide by drowning himself in the New River that runs through Islington. Anna remained a member of the congregation until her death and is commemorated in the church with a plaque which praises her work for \\\"the Cause of Humanity, Peace, and Justice, [and] of Civil and Religious Liberty\\\". Her brother Dr John Aikin lived nearby, and together they co-authored books such as <i>Evenings at Home</i>. As he had been a Unitarian minister in his youth, it is likely that he worshipped at NGUC, with his son Arthur, a prominent scientist, and his daughter Lucy, a biographer. They lived in a house previously occupied by Adam Anderson, clerk to the South Sea Company.</p>\\n<h2>Early nineteenth century: legal acceptance</h2>\\n<p>Thomas Rees took over after Barbauld's death. He was a leading authority of the history of Unitarianism, and made connections with the Unitarian Church of Transylvania. In 1813 two things occurred, key to the understanding of the development of the church: Parliament passed the Doctrine of the Trinity Act, and Rees was succeeded by James Gilchrist, who remained for 15 years. (His son Alexander wrote the standard biography of poet and artist William Blake.) The larger public event meant that the civil and religious liberties that Dissenters had been fighting for were won, the battle of a century and a half was over. The more particular event sowed its own seeds of destruction, as Gilchrist gradually changed his opinions and eventually wrote a pamphlet called \\\"Unitarianism Abandoned\\\", which infuriated his very Unitarian congregation. For a long time he refused to resign, but in the end he was forced out, and the church built a safeguard against such a future occurrence by holding annual elections for the minister. NGUC then entered a very low ebb, with at one point as few as nine subscribers and a rapid turnover of ministers. The causes it had agitated for had been successful, and the church looked backwards with pride, but saw little to look forward to. Energy drained away. \\\"Legal recognition did not prosper the cause of the church, however, which at this time began to decline.\\\"</p>\\n<h2>Mid-nineteenth century: social challenges</h2>\\n<p>\\\"New causes and fresh ideals were needed to revitalise the church, and, fortunately, they were forthcoming.\\\" The nature of Newington Green had changed\\u2014the fresh bucolic village had been swallowed up by London's relentless growth, and had become a \\\"thriving and expanding suburb\\\". With this growth of prosperity also came a tide of poverty, and this was to prove the mission for the Victorian era. A hundred years before, the ethos had been one of almost Puritan self-reliance, but now the Dickensian poverty, evident in cholera epidemics and rampant malnutrition, made social responsibility an urgent necessity. The minister who guided the first 25 years of this (1839\\u201364) was Thomas Cromwell, FSA (1792\\u20131870). (Like many Anglican vicars, one of his hobbies was local history.)</p>\\n<p>A charity school for 14 girls and a monitorial Sunday school for 150 children had been set up in the vicinity by Dissenters in 1790 and 1808 respectively, but these efforts were augmented in the middle of the century. In 1840, a Sunday school was set up for poor children, and soon thereafter a Domestic Mission Society, to visit the poor in their homes. A library and a savings club emphasised self-help. A regular day school ran from 1860 for ten years, until primary education became the responsibility of the state with the passing of the Elementary Education Act 1870.</p>\\n<p>One of the first actions of Cromwell's tenure, in terms of changing the church services, was to introduce the hymnbook of James Martineau. Samuel Sharpe, named after his uncle, the poet Samuel Rogers, came to Newington Green in 1828, and maintained his connection for 30 years, sometimes as treasurer. He was an erudite and generous man, and in 1870 he was elected Chairman of the British and Foreign Unitarian Society. Andrew Pritchard (1804\\u20131882) was treasurer of NGUC 1850-73, during which time donations doubled. He was a microscope and slide maker who made significant improvements to microscopy and studied microscopic organisms; he was a friend of Michael Faraday and for him, science and religion were one. He led the Newington Green Conversation Society, membership restricted to 16, a successor to the Mutual Instruction Society. The \\\"small but energetic community\\\" continued to campaign on the larger political stage, presenting petitions to Parliament on subjects touching religious matters, such as the Dissenting Chapels Bill (made law as Nonconformists Chapels Act 1844), the removal of civil disabilities from the Jews (1847), permission for Dissenters to attend Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and the revision of the King James Bible. Religious freedom and self-improvement were their watchwords.</p>\\n<h2>Later nineteenth century: towards the high water</h2>\\n<p>NGUC thrived during the last decades of the nineteenth century, and its congregation grew to 80\\u00a0subscribers. The London Sunday School Society recognised the one at NGUC as the best in its class, educating up to 200\\u00a0children and necessitating the construction in 1887 of the schoolhouse immediately behind the main church building. A range of groups sprung up, ranging from intellectual (a Society for Mutual Theological Study) to recreational (cycling and cricket). Young Men's and Young Women's groups met, as did the Mothers' Meeting, a Provident Society, and teetotalism (abstinence from alcohol) support for adults and children. Other issues of concern were education, social reform, and women's suffrage.</p>\\n<p>Sister and brother Marian and Ion Pritchard continued the work of their father. The cause of liberal religion in general, and the development of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, were overarching themes. Marian in particular is described as an unsung heroine, and \\\"one of the leaders of modern Unitarianism\\\". She set up Oxford Summer Schools for the training of Sunday School teachers, and Winifred House Invalid Children's Convalescent Home.</p>\\n<h2>Early twentieth century: wars and crises</h2>\\n<p>Thorncroft, author of the church's semiquincentennial history, <i>Trust in Freedom</i>, concludes that NGUC reached its high-water mark at its bicentenary in 1908. Immediately after this, NGUC suffered a religious schism in miniature, when the incoming minister, Dr F. W. G. Foat, backed the New Theology of Reginald John Campbell and the League of Progressive Thought and Service. This Social Gospel movement was not to the taste of all his congregants, and Foat left for the Richmond Free Christian Church. Then came 1914, and Christian faith all over the world was shaken by the horrors of World War I. Unitarians as a body have never been pacifists, unlike the Quakers, and some fifteen members of the congregation and Sunday School fell during the war. Society as a whole found less solace in religion, perhaps particularly liberal religion, with its message of human dignity ringing hollow beside the great guns. Meanwhile, many of the older people with long family ties to Newington Green simply died. The professional middle class had largely left the area. Numbers in the pews dropped. By 1930 \\\"it was whispered that the church could not survive\\\".</p>\\n<p>Nonetheless, survive it did. One influential supporter was an alderman and councillor in the Borough of Stoke Newington, and in 1938 a new lay pastor and his family breathed new life into the church. Although attendance at services was low, other activities drew in crowds: 100 to the temperance meetings, for example. The outbreak of World War II meant that children were evacuated temporarily from London, so the Sunday Schools and Young People's Leagues ceased for a time. The Sunday services never missed a week, however, even when the building was badly damaged by a landmine blast: they just moved to the schoolhouse. After the war, the ministry focused on building bridges between races and faiths, e.g. with the Jewish community of North London, and was recognised by the World Congress of Faiths, an organisation founded by Francis Younghusband. Services were often attended by local politicians, including the Mayor of Stoke Newington. Leaders for the national Unitarian movement continued to be found within the congregation at Newington Green.</p>\\n<h2>Later twentieth century/early twenty-first century: rejuvenation</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the late twentieth century, faced with declining numbers, Newington Green Unitarian Church developed closer ties with Islington Unitarian Church a couple of km away. They started to share a minister and publicise events together under the name New Unity, while remaining legally distinct entities. The 1969 sale of the (New) Gravel Pit Chapel near the centre of the historic village of Hackney released funding via the Charity Commission for maintenance of the Newington Green chapel.</p>\\n<p>By the turn of the millennium, NGUC's community was reduced in numbers. A small congregation of half a dozen elderly women persisted, and a new burst of energy arrived with the appointment of Cathal (Cal) Courtney, first as student pastor in 2002 and then as minister in July 2004. He came from an Ireland of divided communities; he was characterised as a \\\"radical spirit\\\" who had made a \\\"remarkable spiritual journey\\\", and his weekly sermons soon attracted twenty people. In the tradition of Unitarian social action, he led a silent vigil through the night before the huge march against the Iraq War, \\\"protesting against the US-led incursion with, among others, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists and Jews present\\\" Later made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, during his time at NGUC he wrote <i>Towards Beloved Community</i> and was written about as the Right-On Reverend in <i>The Oldie'</i>s monthly \\\"East of Islington\\\" column.</p>\\n<p>The incumbent is Andrew Pakula, an American who grew up in a Jewish family in New York. His MIT doctorate in biology and master's degree in business led to his first career in biotechnology management and business development, before he undertook ministerial training, completing his studies at Unitarian College, Manchester. He began serving in October 2006, was inducted as full minister in January 2010, and was elected to the executive committee of the British Unitarians. He was described\\u00a0\\u2013 sympathetically\\u00a0\\u2013 in the local press as \\\"controversial\\\" when he did a reverse collection plate, giving his own money away to those attending one sermon.</p>\\n<h3>Richard Price Memorial Lecture</h3>\\n<p>Courtney revived the Richard Price Memorial Lecture, which had last been given in 1981. NGUC now sponsors it annually, to address \\\"a topical or important aspect of liberty, reason and ethics\\\". In September 2003 the first of the new series took place under the auspices of the Stoke Newington Unitarian Conference, where Barbara Taylor, author of <i>Mary Wollstonecraft and the Feminist Imagination</i>, spoke on \\\"Radical Dissent and Women's Rights in Eighteenth-Century Britain\\\". In 2005 Will Self addressed the need to disestablish the Church of England  under the title \\\"Why Religion Needs Satire\\\". The November 2008 lecture took the theme of \\\"Dishonesty\\\": Evan Davis, the economist and BBC presenter, used the platform to argue that \\\"the media industry has a 'misleading ethical code' and tendency to be dishonest\\\". The 2009 lecture, given on 27 January 2010, was given by psychotherapist Susie Orbach, who spoke on the topic \\\"Frankenstein's Bodies Today\\\". The 2010 lecture was given by literary critic Terry Eagleton, who spoke on \\\"The New Atheism and the War on Terror\\\". In 2011 Wendy Savage, a doctor and long-time campaigner for women's reproductive health, spoke on \\\" Patients' Choice and Doctors' Responsibilities\\\".</p>\\n<h3>Stance on gay marriage</h3>\\n<p>In March 2008, Newington Green Unitarian Church became the first religious establishment in Britain to refuse to carry out any weddings at all until all couples have equal marriage rights. Unity Church Islington followed suit a couple of months later. Pakula stated that same-sex couples \\\"are being treated like second-class citizens when they are forbidden to celebrate their unions in a way that heterosexual couples take for granted\\\". The BBC called it a \\\"gay rights church\\\" for its unanimous committee vote suspending full wedding services, although NGUC is not a \\\"gay church\\\" such as the Metropolitan Community Church, and it still conducts ceremonial blessings of relationships, straight and gay. The church's decision was in response to the case brought by the Christian Institute, backing the claim of Lillian Ladele, a registrar employed by Islington London Borough Council who wished to be exempted from having to perform civil partnership ceremonies on the grounds of her religion. The move was praised by Rev. Richard Kirker, chairman of the national Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement. \\\"This is the first church I\\u2019ve heard of to have taken this step\\\", he said. \\\"We\\u2019re proud that Islington is striking a blow for human rights.\\\" Following in the steps of his immediate predecessor, who used his inaugural column in the <i>N16 magazine</i> to address the international furore around Gene Robinson's election as bishop, Pakula sees homophobia as the real problem, and his congregation did consider challenging the law under the European Convention on Human Rights. Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell called on the church to conduct a gay marriage in defiance of the law.</p>\\n<h3>Tercentenary celebrations</h3>\\n<p>NGUC celebrated its tercentenary in 2008 under the slogan \\\"300 years of dissent\\\", marking this with events such as planting a crab apple tree, organising a picnic in conjunction with the Newington Green Action Group, and hosting a concert of Ottoman classical music. (There is a strong Turkish community in Newington Green and along the nearest section of Green Lanes, an ancient road which starts from the northwest corner of the Green.)</p>\\n<h3>250th anniversary of Wollstonecraft's birth</h3>\\n<p>The following year it commemorated the 250th anniversary of the birth of Mary Wollstonecraft, attaching a large banner to the railings outside the building, proclaiming it the \\\"birthplace of feminism\\\", in a nod to the formative years that she spent worshipping there. NGUC sponsored a series of events, including a return visit and lecture by biographer Barbara Taylor; a panel discussion about women and power, between female politicians Diane Abbott MP, Jean Lambert MEP, and Emily Thornberry MP; an art exhibition titled Mother of Feminism; a concert featuring Carol Grimes and Adey Grummet, to raise money for Stop the Traffik, an anti-trafficking charity; a tombstone tribute at St Pancras Old Church; a birthday cake baked by men; and other activities.</p>\\n<p>Pakula's sermon in honour of the Wollstonecraft anniversary stressed her role as a prophet. This excerpt serves as a flavour of the emphasis given to social action within the church:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Mary Wollstonecraft was a unique individual\\u00a0\\u2013 brilliant and strong. She was one who would not be swept along in stream of the common beliefs and understandings of her time. Hers was a keener sight\\u00a0\\u2013 a vision that saw beyond what most people take for granted. She saw, contrary to the assumptions of her time, that women were the equals of men. Her bold stance\\u00a0\\u2013 a position that proved to be many years ahead of her time\\u00a0\\u2013 was met with broad condemnation. Today, we recognise that Mary Wollstonecraft spoke with the voice of prophesy. We honour her for her courage and for the gifts she has given to future generations of women and men.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>Regular and occasional activities</h3>\\n<p>Sunday services alternate between NGUC and its Islington sister, including special events such as the yearly Flower Communion; twice-monthly poetry readings and weekly meditation sessions are held at Newington Green. It participates in the annual festival of architecture, Open House London. It hosts occasional concerts, such as that given by the London Gallery Quire, which \\\"performs West Gallery Music, the psalmody heard in parish churches and non-conformist chapels during the Georgian period, from about 1720 to 1850\\\", and the Psallite Women's Choir. The congregation was reported to have grown to 70 as of 2009, with 30 at one Sunday service; it is one of the most rapidly growing Unitarian churches in Britain.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\\n<ul><li><i>The Village that Changed the World: A History of Newington Green London N16</i> by Alex Allardyce.

His education took place at the dissenting academy in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, run by Roger Griffiths, who shortly afterwards conformed to the Church of England. Jones then went to study with James Owen (died 1706) at Shrewsbury Academy. He was funded from February 1704 by a generous grant from the Congregational Fund Board (founded 1695), who later examined him as a candidate for the ministry. However, instead of taking up a position as a dissenting minister, he went to study at the University of Leiden, being there from 7 August 1706; here he encountered the teachings of Jacobus Gronovius, Jacobus Perizonius, and Hermanus Witsius. His notes on their lectures influenced his own systems of divinity and philosophy, which he used during his own teaching.</p>\\n<h2>Creation of the academy</h2>\\n<p>After finishing his education at Leiden, Jones moved to Gloucester, opening his dissenting academy in the Presbyterian Henry Wintle's house in Barton Street. From the outset, the Academy was popular; over its short existence, it was to educate around one hundred students, mostly for the dissenting ministries, making it the largest academy of its type in the south of England; Jones's learning in Jewish antiquities and reformed theology encouraged students from across the country to attend his lectures. But this happened in the face of state persecution. Under the 1662 Act of Uniformity, all schools and academies needed to be licensed by the local bishop, a situation which was not repealed (or even subjected to immunity from prosecution) by the Act of Toleration 1689. In September 1712, Jones was presented at the ecclesiastical court under the 1662 Act of Uniformity for keeping a school or seminary which had not been licensed. One of the most serious charges was that he infiltrated 'seditious and antimonarchical principles' into his students. In the light of comments made by his students such as Thomas Mole, it seems unlikely that Jones's establishment was through-and-through 'prejudicial to the present Establishment.' These students included future conformists of great eminence, including Joseph Butler and Thomas Secker (later Archbishop of Canterbury, as well as major dissenting theologians and controversialists, including Samuel Chandler.</p>\\n<h2>At Tewkesbury</h2>\\n<p>Jones moved the academy to Tewkesbury early in summer 1713, at least partly to move to a bigger house; one of his students, possibly Secker, lent him \\u00a3200 to enable his move; he repaid it over several years. Persecution of the Academy continued, however; following the Henry Sacheverell affair and the attempted passing of Schism bills in parliament, Jones's house was attacked by rioters on the day of the coronation of George I. This local hostility reflects the merger of popular politics and anti-academy state propaganda during Queen Anne's rule.</p>\\n<p>The academy soon faced new problems. After moving to Tewkesbury, Jones became an increasingly heavy drinker and his teaching declined in quality and success. He died at Tewkesbury on 11 October 1719 aged thirty-seven, and was buried in Tewkesbury Abbey. He had married Judith Weaver (d. 1746) shortly before his death; she later married Edward Godwin, a former student; they were to become grandparents of the radical philosopher and theologian William Godwin, husband and biographer of Mary Wollstonecraft. Jones was succeeded at the academy by his nephew, Jeremiah Jones, who removed the Academy to Nailsworth. However, it soon declined in size and reputation.</p>\\n<h2>Posthumous reputation</h2>\\n<p>If anything, Jones's reputation grew after his death. Andrew Kippis, minister of Newington Green Unitarian Church, wrote in his biography of Joseph Butler in the <i>Biographia Britannica</i> that Jones was 'a man of uncommon abilities' and 'erudition', with a 'high and deserved reputation.' He believed that Jones paid great attention to his students' 'morals' and 'progress in literature', directing their studies with 'skill and discernment.' Of Samuel Chandler's education, he commented that he had 'a singular advantage' to be placed under 'so able and accomplished a tutor.'</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q7411871\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":30679766,\"title\":\"Andrew Pakula\",\"text\":\"<p>Rev.

It gives its name to the surrounding area, roughly bounded by Ball's Pond Road to the south, Petherton Road to the west, the southern section of Stoke Newington with Green Lanes, Matthias Road to the north, and Boleyn Road to the east. The Green itself is in N16 and the area is covered by the N16, N1 and N5 postcodes.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Origins</h2>\\n<p>The first record of the area is as 'Neutone' in the Domesday Survey of 1086, when it still formed part of the demesne of St Paul\\u2019s Cathedral. The thirteenth century saw Newton become Newington, whilst the prefix 'Stoke' was added in the area to the north, distinguishing it from Newington Barrow or Newington Berners in Islington. Newington Barrow later became known as Highbury, after the manor house built on a hill.</p>\\n<p>There was probably a medieval settlement, and the prevailing activity was agriculture, growing hay and food for the inhabitants of nearby London. By the 15th century the area had become more prosperous and in 1445 there were a good number of Londoners living in the hamlet. The name Newington Green was first mentioned in 1480. By the 1490s it was fringed by cottages, homesteads and crofts on the three sides in Newington Barrow manor in Islington. The north side was divided between the manors of Stoke Newington and Brownswood in South Hornsey.</p>\\n<h2>Royal visitors and ministers</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the 16th century the area was connected to the court of Henry VIII. The king himself used a house on the south side of the Green as a base for hunting the wild bulls, stags and wild boars that roamed the surrounding forest.</p>\\n<p>In 1523 a resident of the north side of the Green, the future 6th Earl of Northumberland, Henry Percy became engaged to Anne Boleyn. At the time he was page to Cardinal Wolsey. Lord Percy had not sought permission from either his father or the king, causing Wolsey to scold him and his father to refuse the marriage. He later found himself a member of the jury that convicted Anne of adultery. His home, Brook House, stood at the northeast corner of the square. It contained a central courtyard and was decorated with gilded and painted wainscotting. It was later demolished, renamed Bishop's Place, and divided into tenements for the poor.</p>\\n<p>In 1535 Henry VIII's chief minister (i.e. prime minister), Thomas Cromwell, took up residence at Canonbury Tower to the south of the area, from where he organised the Dissolution of the Monasteries and their transfer into royal ownership. (Just a year later Cromwell was accused of treason and executed on spurious evidence.) Other Tower residents included, in the 16th century, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick and afterwards Duke of Northumberland, general, admiral, and politician; in the 17th century, Francis Bacon, the father of the scientific method, at that time the Attorney General, and Sir Thomas Coventry, afterwards Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; in the 18th century, Oliver Goldsmith, the writer.</p>\\n<h2>Samuel Pepys</h2>\\n<p>The famous 17th century diarist Samuel Pepys was sent to the Newington Green and Kingsland area by his mother in order to benefit from the fresh air and open spaces of what was a rural area at that time.</p>\\n<h2>Mildmay</h2>\\n<p>Newington Green's history is marked by several streets in the area taking their name from this period, such as King Henry\\u2019s Walk, Boleyn Road (formerly Ann Boleyn\\u2019s Walk), Wolsey Road and Queen Elizabeth\\u2019s Walk. Many other thoroughfares are named after the Mildmay estate, including Mildmay Park, Mildmay Grove North and Mildmay Grove South. Sir Walter Mildmay was the Chancellor of the Exchequer under Elizabeth I. He was one of the special commissioners in the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, and founded Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1584.</p>\\n<p>His grandson Sir Henry Mildmay served as MP and was Master of the Jewel House for Charles I. Henry was critical of the king's religious policies, supported Parliament during the civil wars and attended the king's trial. After the Restoration Henry was arrested for his part in the regicide, but granted leniency because he had refused to sign the king's death warrant. Instead of the death penalty he was sent to the Tower of London, stripped of his knighthood and his estates and sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\\n<p>Mildmay Mission Hospital was founded in the 1890s, inspired by the work of the Reverend William Pennefather during the cholera epidemic of 1866. It was absorbed into the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, and in the 1980s began pioneering work into the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS, which it continues.</p>\\n<p>Mildmay Park, located on the street of the same name, was a station on the North London Railway. Opened in 1880, it closed in 1934. The station building was demolished in 1987, but remnants of the platforms can still be seen at track level.</p>\\n<h2>Nonconformists and the Dissenting Academies</h2>\\n<p>The area became the home of English Dissenters during the 17th century. Following the religious upheavals after the Restoration, some Protestants chose to remain in England and maintain their faith openly, but they had to live with the restrictions the state placed upon them. They moved to places tolerant of them; often they set up educational establishments, known in general as dissenting academies, which were intellectually and morally more rigorous than the universities. One such place was Newington Green, then still an agricultural village, but conveniently near London.) Oliver Cromwell's family had links there: his great-granddaughter Mary was born at the Green on 11 April 1691.</p>\\n<p>A critical mass of \\\"dissident intellectuals, pedagogues with reforming ideas and Dissenters\\\" and \\\"the well-to-do edge of radical Protestantism\\\" clustered around Newington Green, and other villages nearby such as Stoke Newington and Hackney. Not all of these free-thinkers were Unitarians: other notables include the Quaker physician John Coakley Lettsome and the Anglican pacifist Vicesimus Knox.</p>\\n<p>One such academy was set up on north of the Green, run by Charles Morton. One of the academy's students was Daniel Defoe, the writer, journalist and spy famous for his novel <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. Another pupil was the controversial poet Samuel Wesley, father of John Wesley, the great religious leader. A later schoolmaster was the Rev. James Burgh, author of <i>The Dignity of Human Nature</i> and <i>Thoughts on Education</i>, who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to the church there.</p>\\n<h2>Unitarian Church, Price and Wollstonecraft</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1708 the Newington Green Unitarian Church was built on the north, Hackney side of the Green. That congregation continues today as New Unity. The minister whose name is still remembered centuries later is Dr Richard Price, a libertarian and republican who cemented the village's <i>\\\"reputation as a centre for radical thinkers and social reformers\\\"</i>. He arrived in 1758 with his wife Sarah, and took up residence in No. 54 the Green, in the middle of a terrace even then a hundred years old (The building still survives as London's oldest brick terrace, dated 1658). A large number of important politicians, thinkers, reformers, and writers visited him at Newington Green, including Founding Fathers of the United States, British politicians such as Lord Lyttleton, the Earl of Shelburne, Earl Stanhope (known as <i>\\\"Citizen Stanhope\\\"</i>), and even the Prime Minister William Pitt\\u00a0; philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith; agitators such as prison reformer John Howard, gadfly John Horne Tooke and husband and wife John and Ann Jebb. Price was fortunate in forming close friendships among his neighbours and congregants. One was Thomas Rogers, father of poet and banker Samuel Rogers, a merchant turned banker who had married into a long-established Dissenting family and lived at No. 56 the Green. Another was the Rev. James Burgh, author of <i>The Dignity of Human Nature</i> and <i>Thoughts on Education</i>, who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to Price's sermons. Price, Rogers, and Burgh formed a dining club, eating at each other's houses in rotation. When Joseph Priestley's support of dissent led to the riots named after him, he fled Birmingham and headed for the sanctuary of Newington Green, where Rogers took him in.</p>\\n<p>Arguably the most important resident of the Green was the early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who moved her fledgling school for girls from Islington to Newington Green in 1784, with the help of a fairy godmother. This was Mrs Burgh, widow of the educationalist, who used her influence to find the young schoolmistress a house to rent and twenty students to fill it. The flavour of the village and the approach of these Rational Dissenters appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women. The ideas Wollstonecraft ingested from the sermons at NGUC pushed her towards a political awakening. A couple of years after she left Newington Green, these seeds germinated into <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Men</i>, a response to Burke's denunciation of the French Revolution and attack on Price. In 1792 she published the work for which she is best remembered, <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>, in the spirit of rationalism extending Price's arguments about equality to women. Newington Green had made its mark on Mary, and through this founding work of feminist philosophy, on the world.</p>\\n<h2>The New River</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1602 it was proposed that a new river should be constructed to provide London with its first clean, fresh water. Sir Hugh Myddleton, a Welsh goldsmith and philanthropist, was given the responsibility, and in 1609 he built a canal from the Hertfordshire rivers of Chadwell and Amwell, 38 miles to the New River Head Reservoir at Amwell Street in Clerkenwell. Originally open to the air, the aqueduct flowed down the centre of the present day Petherton Road. It was later covered for sanitary reasons.</p>\\n<p>In 1808, Rochemont Barbauld was appointed minister to Newington Green Unitarian Church. His wife, Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743\\u20131825), was a prolific writer, admired by Samuel Johnson and William Wordsworth. She enjoyed a long friendship with Joseph Priestley and William Enfield, starting from their years together at the Warrington Academy in the 1760s, where her father was tutor. She wrote poems (including a tribute to Priestley), hymns, children's literature, and political and religious tracts. She was an abolitionist, addressing one of her works to William Wilberforce. 1793 saw her contribution to the Pamphlet War, <i>\\\"Sins of the Government, Sins of the Nation\\\"</i>. Two years later she wrote <i>The Rights of Women</i>, but this was not published until her death thirty years later. Rochemont eventually went violently insane, attacked his wife and committed suicide by drowning himself in the river.</p>\\n<p>In 1946 the supply was redirected at Stoke Newington and in 1990 the New River was replaced by deep mains. Part of the New River\\u2019s original course through Canonbury has now been turned into an ornamental walk.</p>\\n<h2>Synagogues and Jewish life</h2>\\n\\n<p>Other religious institutions existed nearby. Jews fleeing the pogroms of the Russian Empire established a congregation by 1876, and built the Dalston Synagogue in adjoining Poets Road in 1885. This became one of the leading synagogues of London, with Jacob Koussevitzsky as its cantor from 1936.</p>\\n<p>For a period from the end of the nineteenth century, the Newington Green Area was host to a large Jewish population, which was beginning to leave the East End and move northwards towards Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill. The original Adath Israel orthodox congregation was founded in 1911 and its first permanent building was in Alma Road, off Green Lanes, before moving on towards Stoke Newington and the other side of Clissold Park in the 1950s. A large United Synagogue was built in Poets Road in the 1870s and remained active until it closed down in the late 1960s, as the remaining Jewish population moved on further afield. At its height, the Poets Road Synagogue (or as it was known the Dalston Synagogue despite the fact that it was not in Dalston - well, in fact, it was originally very close to Dalson Junction Station) had hundreds of worshippers (unlikely as it had only 400 male members at that time  and, for a short while in the 1930s, was the home of one of the world's leading cantors, a member of the Kusevitsky family.</p>\\n<p>The synagogue site was eventually sold and the beautiful building, along with its stained glass windows, was demolished in 1970 and replaced by a block of council flats, leaving no trace of the Jewish life which existed in this area.</p>\\n<h2>19th century</h2>\\n<p>The early part of the 19th century saw a change in the character of Newington Green. After a patient struggle of 150 years, the English Dissenters were finally freed from their civil disabilities with the passage of the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813. With, it seemed, nothing left to fight for on that front, Nonconformists no longer needed the security of the Newington Green, and the area lost some of its intellectual cohesiveness. The church touched a low point. The nature of Newington Green had changed\\u2014the fresh bucolic village had been swallowed up by London's relentless growth, and had become a <i>\\\"thriving and expanding suburb\\\"</i>. With this growth of prosperity also came a tide of poverty, and this was to prove the mission for the Victorian era. A hundred years before, the ethos had been one of almost Puritan self-reliance, but now the Dickensian poverty, evident in cholera epidemics and rampant malnutrition, made social responsibility an urgent necessity. The minister who guided the first 25 years of this (1839\\u201364) was Thomas Cromwell, FSA (1792\\u20131870). (Like many Anglican vicars, one of his hobbies was local history.) In 1840, a Sunday school was set up for poor children, and soon thereafter a Domestic Mission Society, to visit the poor in their homes. A library and a savings club emphasised self-help. A regular day school ran from 1860 for ten years, until primary education became the responsibility of the state with the passing of the Elementary Education Act 1870.</p>\\n<p>The <i>\\\"small but energetic community\\\"</i> continued to campaign on the larger political stage. Religious freedom and self-improvement were their watchwords. In the last decades of the 19th century, the church thrived and its congregation grew to 80 subscribers. The London Sunday School Society recognised the one at Newington Green as the best in its class, educating up to 200 children and necessitating the construction in 1887 of the schoolhouse immediately behind the main church building. A range of groups sprang up, ranging from intellectual (a Society for Mutual Theological Study) to recreational (cycling and cricket). Young men's and young women's groups met, as did the mothers' meeting, a Provident Society, and teetotalism (abstinence from alcohol) support for adults and children. Other issues of concern were education, social reform and women's suffrage.</p>\\n<p>Some individuals who lived at the Green during this period included Thomas Rees, the minister after Barbauld, who was a leading authority of the history of Unitarianism, and made connections with the Unitarian Church of Transylvania. Alexander Gilchrist, son of another minister, was the biographer of William Blake. Andrew Pritchard improved the microscope and studied microscopic organisms; he was a friend of Michael Faraday and for him, science and religion were one. He led the Newington Green Conversation Society, membership restricted to 16, a successor to the Mutual Instruction Society. Marian Pritchard is described as an unsung heroine, and <i>\\\"one of the leaders of modern Unitarianism\\\"</i>. She set up Oxford Summer Schools for the training of Sunday School teachers and Winifred House Invalid Children's Convalescent Home. John Stuart Mill recalls his family living in Newington Green \\\"from 1810 to the end of 1813\\\"; it was at the time <i>\\\"an almost rustic neighbourhood\\\"</i>, and it was during walks with his father before breakfast <i>\\\"generally in the green lanes towards Hornsey\\\"</i> (<i>\\\"my earliest recollections of green fields and wild flowers\\\"</i>) that John Stuart would recount to James Mill what he had learnt reading the previous day.</p>\\n<h2>20th century</h2>\\n<p>Then came 1914, and the horrors of World War I. Men from Newington Green fell in battle. Meanwhile, many of the older people with long family ties to Newington Green simply died. The professional middle class had largely left the area. By 1930 <i>\\\"it was whispered that the church could not survive\\\"</i>, but it did, with an influential supporter, an alderman and councillor in the Borough of Stoke Newington. Although attendance at services was low, other activities drew in crowds: 100 to the temperance meetings, for example. The outbreak of World War II meant that children were evacuated temporarily from London, so the Sunday Schools and Young People's Leagues ceased for a time. The Sunday services never missed a week, however, even when the building was badly damaged by a landmine blast: they just moved to the schoolhouse. After the war, the ministry focused on building bridges between races and faiths, e.g. with the Jewish community of North London, and was recognised by the World Congress of Faiths. Services were often attended by local politicians, including the mayor of Stoke Newington. Leaders for the national Unitarian movement continued to be found within the congregation at Newington Green.</p>\\n<h2>Newington Green today</h2>\\n\\n<p>The Green, far from being a pleasant and well-manicured garden square, was for many years just a run-down green space that straddled the border between Islington N1 and Hackney N16. However, in 1979 the Newington Green Action Group (NGAG) was formed with the aim of regenerating the area. NGAG worked with Islington Council on this project and traffic calming measures were installed to ease the notorious local congestion, with additional pedestrian crossings providing easier and safer access to the Green on foot. The Green itself was regenerated to include more lawn space, a play area and a caf\\u00e9. New planting has enhanced the Green and was chosen to encourage biodiversity.</p>\\n<p>Newington Green has grown in popularity with the local community, evinced by the children that now play in the formerly deserted park, which is once more being used like a village green. Community groups hold fairs on the Green and NGAG has organised many events including the annual Jazz on the Green and Open Garden Squares day. These improvements are such that in 2006, Newington Green won the first of many Green Flag Awards (the national standard for parks and green spaces in England and Wales, sponsored by Keep Britain Tidy). It has also won the Green Heritage Site Award for several years running, which is sponsored by English Heritage. In 2010 NGAG teamed up with the Mayville Gardening Club and the King Henry's Walk Community Garden; the Newington Green area was awarded a High Silver Gilt Royal Horticultural Society Urban Communities Award, as part of the London in Bloom Scheme.</p>\\n<p>The Newington Green Action Group also published a local history book <i>The Village That Changed the World: A History of Newington Green London N16</i> by Alex Allardyce in 2008, which won the Walter Bor Award the following year.</p>\\n<p>Newington Green and Newington Green Road to the south constitute the commercial and cultural centre of the district. This area shares in the gentrification of Islington and Stoke Newington, so the old shopping area has now been supplemented by a number of new and trendy shops, bars and restaurants. However, there is a substantial Turkish Cypriot community in the area, members of whom run many of the local grocery stores.</p>\\n<p>Since the millennium, two new ministers at the Unitarian Church have injected energy into the Green and added to its events and publicity. Cathal (Cal) Courtney, characterised as a \\\"radical spirit\\\" who had made a \\\"remarkable spiritual journey\\\", opened the church for a multi-faith silent protest vigil through the night before the huge march against the Iraq War. He used his inaugural column in the <i>N16 magazine</i> to address the international furore around Gene Robinson's election as bishop. He was written about as the Right-On Reverend in <i>The Oldie'</i>s monthly \\\"East of Islington\\\" column. Courtney revived the Richard Price Memorial Lecture, which had last been given in 1981. NGUC now sponsors it annually, to \\\"(address) a topical or important aspect of liberty, reason and ethics.\\\"</p>\\n<p>The current minister is Andrew (Andy) Pakula, an American who grew up in a secular Jewish family in New York. Newington Green Unitarian Church made history when it became the first religious establishment in Britain to refuse to carry out any weddings at all until same-sex couples have the right to full legal marriage. The BBC called it a \\\"gay rights church\\\" for its unanimous committee vote suspending full wedding services.</p>\\n<p>NGUC celebrated its tercentenary in 2008 under the slogan \\\"300 years of dissent\\\", marking this with events such as planting a crab apple tree, organising a picnic in conjunction with the Newington Green Action Group, and hosting a concert of Ottoman classical music. (Newington Green has a strong Turkish population.) The following year it commemorated the 250th anniversary of the birth of Mary Wollstonecraft, attaching a large banner to the railings outside the building, proclaiming it the \\\"birthplace of feminism\\\", in a nod to the formative years that she spent worshipping there. NGUC sponsored a series of events, including a return visit and lecture by biographer Barbara Taylor; a panel discussion about women and power, between female politicians Diane Abbott MP, Jean Lambert MEP, and Emily Thornberry MP; an art exhibition entitled Mother of Feminism; a concert featuring Carol Grimes and Adey Grummet to raise money for Stop the Traffik, an anti-trafficking charity; a tombstone tribute at St Pancras Old Church; a birthday cake baked by men; and other activities.</p>\\n<p>Weekly poetry readings are held at NGUC. It participates in the annual festival of architecture, Open House London. It hosts occasional concerts, such as that given by the London Gallery Quire, and the Psallite Women's Choir.</p>\\n<h2>Cafe and building in the park</h2>\\n<p>In July 2013 a new cafe called \\\"Lizzy's on the Green\\\" opened in the kiosk on the green.</p>\\n<h2>Listed buildings</h2>\\n\\n<p>This outlying area of Islington carries a surprising wealth of historic architecture and Newington Green has become a conservation area. On the west side of the Green (numbers 52-55) is London's oldest surviving brick terrace, which is Grade I listed. These were built in 1658, and 100 years later were home to Price and Rogers. Shop fronts were added to all of them in the 1880s, but have now been removed on three of the houses, presumably restoring something like their original appearance. Residential London, particularly outside Westminster and the City, is essentially a 19th-century city. Even in the centre, there are no brick houses this old, pre-dating the Great Fire of 1666. Two of the properties have been extensively renovated under the guidance of Bere Architects (Islington).</p>\\n<p>The Green also has two Grade II listed buildings. To the north is the Unitarian Church, which celebrated its tercentenary in 2008. The original 1708 building was financed with \\u00a3300 from goldsmith Edward Harrison. It was a <i>\\\"substantial brick building, of nearly square form, with the high, tiled, projecting roof, common at its era\\\"</i>. <i>\\\"Historic views show that the original fa\\u00e7ade had a small pediment against a large hipped roof, with a central oval window below.\\\"</i> This building was substantially extended and improved in the mid-19th century. An internal gallery was built to increase the seating available, and a few years later the roof and apse were renewed, and a <i>\\\"stuccoed frontage\\\"</i> was built, <i>\\\"mirrroring the original fa\\u00e7ade with a three-bay front with two round-headed windows, but with added Tuscan pilasters and a large pediment\\\"</i>. In the mid-20th century, the building was damaged by enemy action. In 1953 its architectural importance was recognised as a Grade II listed building.</p>\\n<p>To the west is its neighbour, the former headquarters of the China Inland Mission, an organisation founded by James Hudson Taylor in 1865 and responsible for 18,000 converts to Christianity.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\\n<ul><li><i>The Village that Changed the World: A History of Newington Green London N16</i> by Alex Allardyce.</li>\\n<li><i>Vindication: A Life of Mary Wollstonecraft</i> by Lyndall Gordon.

Able to play at full-back or more commonly as a defensive midfielder, he picked up a reputation in the Football League as a 'hatchet man' in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>\\n<p>He turned professional at his boyhood club Arsenal in September 1962, and became a first team regular after making his debut in October 1965. He spent 15 years at the club, winning the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970, the First Division title in 1970\\u201371, and the FA Cup in 1971. He also was a losing finalist in the 1968 and 1969 League Cup and the 1972 FA Cup Final. He also won 19 caps for England between April 1971 and June 1973. He was transferred to Fulham in March 1977 before announcing his retirement eight months later.</p>\\n<p>After retiring from football he was convicted of various criminal offences; including keeping a brothel, and was jailed for three years for financing a plot to counterfeit gold coins. He has been married four times and has three sons and one daughter; he currently resides in southern France with his fourth wife.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Storey was born on 7 September 1945 in Farnham, Surrey to Edwin, a carpenter and builder, and Nellie, a part-time shop assistant. As a child he would occasionally accompany his father to matches at the Recreation Ground to see Aldershot play in the Fourth Division. However he began supporting Arsenal from an early age. From the age of 11 he was coached by former Aldershot striker Charlie Mortimore for the Aldershot and Farnborough Schools Football Association. He soon attracted the attention of Arsenal with his performances at schoolboy level, and impressed across the back four enough to represent England Schoolboys.</p>\\n<h2>Club career</h2>\\n<h3>Arsenal</h3>\\n<p>Storey signed as an apprentice at Arsenal after leaving school in 1961. As a young player he was focused on his career, and was not interested in frequenting nightclubs with his fellow apprentices. He signed professional forms in September 1962 and spent the 1962\\u201363 season playing for the Arsenal third team in the Metropolitan League. A buildup of senior player on the books at Arsenal meant that Storey had little chance to play for the reserve team.</p>\\n<p>He made his senior debut on 30 October 1965, taking Billy McCullough's place at left-back in a 3\\u20131 defeat to Leicester City at Filbert Street. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> reported that he had a \\\"promising\\\" game against a \\\"clever\\\" opponent in right-winger Jackie Sinclair. He retained his first team place and went on to play all of the remaining 29 games, though the season would prove to be a poor one for the \\\"Gunners\\\" as manager Billy Wright was sacked after dropping top-scorer Joe Baker and disillusioning the dressing room. Arsenal finished in 14th place in 1965\\u201366, just four points above the relegation zone, and were knocked out of the FA Cup at the Third Round following a 3\\u20130 defeat to Blackburn Rovers, who would end the season bottom of the First Division.</p>\\n<p>Storey quickly made a name for himself as a rough player early in the 1966\\u201367 season as he injured Manchester City winger Mike Summerbee; the <i>Daily Express</i> reported that \\\"Storey... is overdoing the tough guy act\\\". He was warned by new manager Bertie Mee not to get sent off after Storey got involved in a brawl during an FA Cup win over Gillingham. The team improved under Mee's strict leadership, and finished the season in seventh place, cutting goals conceded to 47 from the previous season's tally of 75. Storey started 34 league games, missing eight matches due to injury and illness. He scored his first professional goal on 22 April 1967, in a 1\\u20131 draw with Nottingham Forest at Highbury.</p>\\n<p>Bob McNab established himself at left-back in the 1967\\u201368 season, and so Storey was moved over to right-back. Despite being a full-back he was sometimes given the job of marking a dangerous and creative opposition player closely, and though he was never ordered to use rough play he was on these occasions told \\\"you know what to do, Peter\\\". He was sent off for the first time in his career, along with Frank McLintock, in a 1\\u20130 defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor in December 1967; despite his tough tackling he was actually dismissed for bad language. Arsenal finished the season in ninth place, but advanced past Coventry City, Reading, Blackburn Rovers, Burnley and Huddersfield Town to face Leeds United in the final of the League Cup at Wembley. Leeds won the game through a Terry Cooper volley on 20 minutes, and Arsenal barely created any chances in the game.</p>\\n<p>Arsenal reached fourth place in the 1968\\u201369 season after conceding just 27 league goals, and advanced past Sunderland, Scunthorpe United, Liverpool, Blackpool and North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur to reach the final against Third Division side Swindon Town. Swindon won the match 3\\u20131, with left-winger Don Rogers scoring two extra-time goals after evading the close attentions of Storey.</p>\\n<p>Their league position meant in 1968\\u201369 that Arsenal qualified for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in the 1969\\u201370 season, and they advanced past Glentoran (Northern Ireland), Sporting (Portugal), Rouen (France), FCM Bac\\u0103u (Romania) and Ajax (Netherlands) to reach the final against Belgian club Anderlecht. Anderlecht won 3\\u20131 at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium after their possession football controlled the entire game until substitute Ray Kennedy scored a crucial header in the 82nd minute. Arsenal turned around the tie with a 3\\u20130 home victory to claim the club's first trophy in 17 years. Despite their European exploits the team still struggled in England, and finished the league in 12th spot.</p>\\n<p>They defended their European trophy up until the quarter-finals, knocking out Lazio (Italy), SK Sturm Graz (Austria) and K.S.K. Beveren (Belgium), before losing to German side 1. FC K\\u00f6ln on away goals despite a rare goal from Storey. The First Division title race was contested largely between Arsenal and Leeds, and the \\\"Gunners\\\" recovered from an indifferent winter to claim nine successive victories between 2 March and 20 April and eventually they finished on 65 points, one place and one point above Leeds. The most crucial match of the campaign came against Leeds at Elland Road on 25 April, which Leeds won 1\\u20130 after an injury-time goal from Jack Charlton. During the game Billy Bremner stamped on Storey's face, though this was an accidental collision during a goalmouth scramble. Arsenal won the title on the final day of the season with a 1\\u20130 win over Spurs at White Hart Lane, though Storey missed the final two league games of the season after damaging ligaments in his ankle. They secured the double in 1970\\u201371 after winning the FA Cup, though their progress in the competition was slow, as they beat Yeovil Town, Portsmouth (in a replay) \\u2013 Storey scored a penalty in both the original tie and the replay, Manchester City, Leicester City (in a replay), and then Stoke City (in a replay). Storey gave a man-of-the-match performance in the original semi-final tie against Stoke at Hillsborough, scoring two goals to rescue a 2\\u20130 half-time deficit; with the first goal he beat Gordon Banks with a volley on the edge of the penalty area, and with the second he sent Banks the wrong way with an injury-time penalty kick. The replay at Villa Park was less dramatic, and Arsenal won the tie with a comfortable 2\\u20130 result. In the final he was assigned to mark Liverpool's Steve Heighway, and kept the Liverpool winger quiet until Storey was substituted for Eddie Kelly after 64 minutes. Both Heighway and Kelly scored in extra-time, but the winning goal came from \\\"Gunners\\\" striker Charlie George.</p>\\n\\n<p>He helped Arsenal to get off to a solid start in defence of their title in the 1971\\u201372 campaign, before he picked up a thigh injury which caused him to miss a few weeks of games from late September. In December, Mee spent \\u00a3220,000 on Everton midfielder Alan Ball, who took Storey's place in the first eleven for his debut on 27 December. In the new year Storey and numerous other Arsenal players confronted the club's management after learning that Ball was paid \\u00a3250 a week \\u2013 more than double most of the rest of the squad. Storey returned to the first team for an FA Cup clash with Derby County on 26 February, as Eddie Kelly was out injured. The next month Arsenal lost three away league games in a row, which all but ended their chances of retaining their title. Storey was out of the team as Arsenal progressed to the quarter-finals of the European Cup \\u2013 though he did feature in the Second Round victory over Swiss club Grasshopper \\u2013 and he proved unable to prevent a Johan Cruyff inspired Ajax from claiming a 3\\u20131 aggregate victory. Arsenal progressed past Swindon Town, Reading, Derby County, Orient, and Stoke City to reach the 1972 FA Cup Final. Leeds United limited Arsenal in the final and a headed goal from Allan Clarke was enough to win the cup for Leeds with a 1\\u20130 victory.</p>\\n<p>Storey failed to pick up a winners medal in the 1972\\u201373 season as Arsenal finished second in the league \\u2013 three points behind Liverpool \\u2013 and lost 2\\u20131 to Sunderland in the FA Cup semi-finals. Arsenal had won at Anfield in February, but dropped points in the end of season run-in and ended the season with a 6\\u20131 defeat to Leeds.</p>\\n<p>Arsenal started the 1973\\u201374 season poorly and exited the League Cup at the hands of Third Division Tranmere Rovers before being knocked out of the FA Cup by Second Division Aston Villa. They eventually finished the league in tenth place, 20 points behind Leeds. The decline continued in the 1974\\u201375 campaign, which ended with Arsenal finishing four places and four points above the relegation zone. Storey was mostly limited to the reserve team during the 1975\\u201376 season, but injuries to Sammy Nelson and Eddie Kelly forced his return to the first team in the build-up to Christmas. On 8 March Storey was suspended by the club after refusing to turn up for work with the reserve team.</p>\\n<p>Mee retired in the summer of 1976, and his successor was Terry Neill, who was the Arsenal captain when Storey made his debut. He returned to the first team in spells, but the purchase of Alan Hudson in January 1977 spelt the end for Storey at Highbury. Storey played his final game for Arsenal on 29 January 1977, replacing Malcolm Macdonald as a substitute in a 3\\u20131 victory over Coventry City in the FA Cup. He refused to train with the reserves and was again suspended by the club before accepting a free transfer to Fulham in March 1977.</p>\\n<h3>Fulham</h3>\\n<p>When Storey arrived at Craven Cottage, Fulham were one place above the Second Division relegation zone and under the management of Bobby Campbell; training was relaxed and superstar signings George Best, Bobby Moore and Rodney Marsh were past their best. Sttorey played 12 games at the end of the 1976\\u201377 season, helping the \\\"Cottagers\\\" to finish out of the relegation zone. He featured in five league and two cup games at the start of the 1977\\u201378 season, his final appearance as a professional football coming in a 1\\u20130 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 10 September. His contract with Fulham was cancelled in November 1977 and Storey announced his retirement from football.</p>\\n<h2>International career</h2>\\n<p>Storey made his England debut under Alf Ramsey on 21 April 1971, in a 3\\u20130 win over Greece at Wembley in a qualifying game for UEFA Euro 1972. Despite at the time being used as a midfielder at club level he played at right-back as Ramsey wanted to assess his options at the full-back position; his rivals for the number 2 shirt were Keith Newton (Everton), Emlyn Hughes (Liverpool), Paul Reaney (Leeds United), Chris Lawler (Liverpool), and Paul Madeley (Leeds United). He almost did not play the game as Arsenal manager Bertie Mee ordered both Storey and teammate Bob McNab to pull out of the fixture to play a league game against Burnley the day before, but was allowed to play for England after coach Don Howe persuaded Mee to reconsider his decision. Storey picked up an assist in the match after providing the cross for Francis Lee's late header. His second cap came in a 1\\u20130 British Home Championship win over Northern Ireland at Windsor Park, in which he played in midfield and man-marked George Best.</p>\\n<p>In 1972, Storey sat on the bench for the first leg of the Euro '72 qualifying quarter-finals match with West Germany, which ended in a 3\\u20131 defeat. He played in the return leg at the Olympiastadion, helping England to secure a 0\\u20130 draw but not a place in the tournament. Despite the respectable draw Ramsey was criticised for naming a negative line-up when England needed a win. His performance in Berlin was the first of a run of 15 successive England appearances for Storey. He played in 1972's three British Home Championship games, helping England to finish joint-first in the tournament after he and Norman Hunter out-battled Billy Bremner, Denis Law and Bobby Moncur at Hampden Park in a 1\\u20130 victory.</p>\\n<p>He made his final appearance for England in a 2\\u20130 friendly defeat to Italy in Turin on 14 June 1973. He was on the bench for the crucial final game of qualification for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, with Colin Bell favoured in midfield with Paul Madeley and Emlyn Hughes at full-back, as England drew 1\\u20131 and failed to qualify for the tournament. He did though feature in one game for The Football League XI in a 5\\u20130 win over Scottish Football League XI at Maine Road on 20 March 1974, having already featured for The Football League XI in a 2\\u20131 win over the League of Ireland XI in Dublin on 22 September 1971.</p>\\n<h2>Style of play</h2>\\n<p>Storey began his career as a right-back, and soon picked up a reputation as a powerful tackler. Later in his career he was deployed as a defensive midfielder so as to break up opposition play further up the pitch. He gained a reputation as Arsenal's \\\"hard man\\\" in a violent era of British football where clubs would typically employ at least one tough player willing to use dirty play to hurt the opposition and to protect their own generally more skilled players. He later admitted to using premeditated tackles from behind early in matches to try and intimidate opponents at a time when referees were reluctant to punish fouls. His rough play was frequently criticised by pundits, though during the 1970s the footballing authorities took little action to try and punish him or any other of football's \\\"hard men\\\". Teammate Bob McNab, quoted in <i>Seventy-One Guns</i> wrote that \\\"Peter was a nightmare for players when he marked them man for man\\\". He was also an efficient taker of penalty kicks, and the only penalties he missed had little bearing on the final result of the match.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<p>\\\"Here are a few choice words which have been used to describe me: assassin, bastards' bastard (courtesy of 'Chopper' Harris), boot boy, bully, calculating, 'cold eyes', destructive, dirty, hatchet man, merciless, pernicious, rogue, ruthless, thug, vicious.\\\"</p>\\n\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Personal life and criminal convictions</h2>\\n<p>His marriage to first wife Susan broke down six months after their marriage in summer 1969. She left him for good in February 1971 after tiring of his self-described \\\"boozy, carefree ways\\\". He met his second wife, Cathy McDonald, at London's Playboy Club in May 1972. The pair began living together before getting married in 1975. The couple had a daughter, Natalie, in December 1976. He married third wife Gill shortly before she gave birth to his son, Peter, in November 1981. His second son, Anthony, was born in December 1982. His third son, Jamie, was born in September 1987. He later divorced Gill and married a Frenchwoman, Daniele Scorceletti. He later split from Daniele and got back together with Gill, before leaving Gill and his three sons to return to Daniele some years later. By 2010 he was in regular contact with his three sons, but has not seen daughter Natalie in decades.</p>\\n<p>His life began to fall apart in 1975 after he took a three-year tenancy agreement out on the <i>Jolly Farmers</i> pub on London's Southgate Road. At the time it was common for footballers to invest in pubs, as had several of his Arsenal teammates. His marriage to Cathy fell apart as he spent more nights at his pub, with the attractions of drink and women, than at home with his wife. He became more dependent on alcohol as his career at Arsenal came to an end. He also invested in a minicab firm in Newington Green, which was a financial failure.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q732057\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":33274941,\"title\":\"John W.

It is bounded by Hackney Road to the south, Kingsland Road to the west, Middleton Road to the north, with London Fields and Broadway Market to the east. In the 1990s a number of the area's more rundown housing estates were refurbished and some disused public buildings were privately converted into gated communities.</p>\\n<p>The area has the 9th highest crime rate in Hackney. [1]</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Origin</h2>\\n\\n<p>Haggerston is first recorded in the Domesday Book as <i>Hergotestane</i>, possibly of Viking origin, and an outlying hamlet of Shoreditch. On Rocque's 1745 map of Hackney, the village is shown as <i>Agostone</i> but by the 19th century it had become part of the growing urban sprawl, with factories and streets of workers' cottages lining the canal.</p>\\n<h2>Today</h2>\\n<p>The proximity to Hoxton and Shoreditch has made the area popular with students and workers in the creative industries, as these nearby areas have grown more expensive. In recent years, escalating property prices have driven commercial art galleries further into east London, which has exacerbated this effect.</p>\\n<p>A shortage of secondary school places has made the area less attractive to families but this is likely to change with the building of a City Academy on Laburnum Street.</p>\\n<p>Many Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian people have formed communities in Haggerston and nearby Shoreditch. Outside the area, the most visible sign of this is the profusion of Southeast Asian restaurants on nearby Kingsland Road in Shoreditch and on Mare Street in Hackney. There is also a notable Russian community focused on bars and caf\\u00e9s along Kingsland Road.</p>\\n<h2>Amenities</h2>\\n\\n<p>Besides the Regents Canal, Haggerston Park, on the site of a demolished gasworks on Hackney Road, provides much-needed open space in the area. Also in the area is the Hackney City Farm. The Regent Estate provides the Regent Estate Pensioners Club/Hall and the Regent Estate Community Center/Hall which together provide community services and spaces for hire. The Regent Estate Pensioners Hall is also used as a Polling Station.</p>\\n<p>The Grade II listed Haggerston Pool, designed by Alfred Cross and opened in 1904, was closed in 2000. In June 2009, after a long community campaign, a \\u00a35m grant was announced from the Department for Children, Schools and Families to refurbish and re-open the pool. The building would also contain community facilities and a GP surgery.</p>\\n<p>Haggerston School is a Grade II listed building, designed by modernist architect Ern\\u0151 Goldfinger and built in 1964\\u201365.</p>\\n<p>This area of Hackney has a long association with clowning. Holy Trinity Church still hosts an annual clowns' service to commemorate Joseph Grimaldi and All Saints Centre at one time housed the Clowns Gallery and Museum, including props and a unique collection of painted eggs, serving as the 'registration' of clowns' make-up. Much of the collection is now on display at Wookey Hole. Other Anglican churches in Haggerston are All Saints, Haggerston Road; St Columba, Kingsland Road; and Sts Mary and Chad, Nichols Square.</p>\\n<h2>Ward</h2>\\n<p>The Haggerston electoral ward forms part of the Hackney South and Shoreditch constituency.</p>\\n<p>The ward returns three councillors to Hackney Council, with an election every four years. At the election on 6 May 2010, Ann Munn, Jonathan McShane, and Barry Buitekant, all Labour Party candidates, were returned. Turnout was 54%; with 5,006 votes cast.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>Secondary schools in the area include Haggerston School and The Bridge Academy.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<h3>Railway stations</h3>\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Haggerston station, served by London Overground.</li>\\n<li>Cambridge Heath station, served by Greater Anglia.</li>\\n</ul><h3>Walking and cycling</h3>\\n<p>The Regents Canal towpath is easily accessible to pedestrians and cyclists. It provides access to Victoria Park to the east and Islington to the west.</p>\\n<h3>Public Art</h3>\\n<p>The condemned Haggerston and Kingsland Estate was slated for demolition in the 1990s but the process did not get underway for another 20 years. In 2009 artists Andrea Luka Zimmerman and Lasse Johansson, who lived on the Haggerston Estate on Dunston Road, created the I AM HERE project, placing on the building large portrait photographs of the current estate residents who were about to be moved out so the building could be demolished. These faced the Regent's Canal and were popular with passersby. The project came down in April 2014.</p>\\n<p>On the Kingsland Estate in Whiston Road, Egyptian painter Nazir Tanbouli created the \\\"King's Land\\\" project where, in the space of 4 months, he covered all of the buildings of the condemned estate with murals. The Kingsland Estate was demolished in late 2013.</p>\\n<h2>Notable residents</h2>\\n<ul><li>William Randal Cremer Liberal MP for Haggerston, pacifist and winner of the 1903 Nobel Peace Prize</li>\\n<li>Edmund Halley, astronomer, was born here in 1656.</li>\\n<li>Owen James, economist, was raised here.</li>\\n<li>Iain Sinclair, writer</li>\\n<li>Nazir Tanbouli, artist</li>\\n<li>Rachel Whiteread, sculptor</li>\\n<li>The Little Sisters of Jesus opened their first London community here in 1989.</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\\n<ul><li>Jones, T.

Much of his work is rooted in London, most recently within the influences of psychogeography.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Life and work</h2>\\n<p>Sinclair was born in Cardiff, and educated at Trinity College, Dublin (where he edited <i>Icarus</i>). He attended the Courtauld Institute of Art (University of London), and the London School of Film Technique (now the London Film School).</p>\\n<h3>Development as author</h3>\\n<p>His early work was mostly poetry, much of it published by his own small press, Albion Village Press. He was (and remains) closely connected with the British avant garde poetry scene of the 1960s and 1970s \\u2013 authors such as Edward Dorn, J. H. Prynne, Douglas Oliver, Peter Ackroyd and Brian Catling are often quoted in his work and even turn up in fictionalized form as characters; later on, taking over from John Muckle, Sinclair edited the Paladin Poetry Series and, in 1996, the Picador anthology <i>Conductors of Chaos</i>.</p>\\n<p>His early books <i>Lud Heat</i> (1975) and <i>Suicide Bridge</i> (1979) were a mixture of essay, fiction and poetry; they were followed by <i>White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings</i> (1987), a novel juxtaposing the tale of a disreputable band of bookdealers on the hunt for a priceless copy of Arthur Conan Doyle's <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> and the Jack the Ripper murders (here attributed to the physician William Gull).</p>\\n<p>Sinclair was for some time perhaps best known for the novel <i>Downriver</i> (1991), which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the 1992 Encore Award. It envisages the UK under the rule of the Widow, a grotesque version of Margaret Thatcher as viewed by her harshest critics, who supposedly establishes a one party state in a fifth term. <i>Radon's Daughter</i> formed the third part of a trilogy with <i>White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings</i> and <i>Downriver.</i></p>\\n<p>The volume of essays <i>Lights Out for the Territory</i> gained Sinclair a wider readership by treating the material of his novels in non-fiction form. His essay 'Sorry Meniscus' (1999) ridicules the Millennium Dome. In 1997, he collaborated with Chris Petit, sculptor Steve Dilworth, and others to make <i>The Falconer</i>, a 56-minute semi-fictional 'documentary' film set in London and the Outer Hebrides about the British underground filmmaker Peter Whitehead. It also features Stewart Home, Kathy Acker and Howard Marks.</p>\\n<h3>Psychogeography</h3>\\n<p>Much of Sinclair's recent work consists of an ambitious and elaborate literary recuperation of the so-called occultist psychogeography of London. Other psychogeographers who have worked on similar material include Will Self, Stewart Home and the London Psychogeographical Association.</p>\\n<p>One of a series of works focused around London is the non-fiction <i>London Orbital</i>; the hard cover edition was published in 2002, along with a documentary film of the same name and subject. It describes a series of trips he took tracing the M25, London's outer-ring motorway, on foot. Sinclair followed this with <i>Edge of the Orison</i> in 2005, a psychogeographical reconstruction of the poet John Clare's walk from Dr Matthew Allen's private lunatic asylum, at Fairmead House, High Beach, in the centre of Epping Forest in Essex, to his home in Helpston, near Peterborough. Sinclair also writes about Claybury Asylum, another psychiatric hospital in Essex, in <i>Rodinsky's Room</i>, a collaboration with the artist Rachel Lichtenstein.</p>\\n<p>In 2008 he wrote the introduction to <i>Wide Boys Never Work</i>, the London Books reissue of Robert Westerby's classic London low-life novel. <i>Hackney, That Rose-Red Empire: A Confidential Report</i> followed in 2009.</p>\\n<p>Sinclair's book <i>Ghost Milk</i> criticizes the British government for using the 2012 Summer Olympics as an excuse to militarize London while forcing the poorest citizens out of their homes.</p>\\n<p>In an interview with <i>This Week in Science</i>, William Gibson said that Sinclair was his favourite author. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2009. Sinclair commented: \\\"I have always admired the RSPCA. They do a lot of good work.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Iain Sinclair lives in Haggerston, in the London Borough of Hackney, and has a flat in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Iain_Sinclair_cheltenham.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q5980623\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1}],\"lon\":-0.07663,\"wikidata\":\"Q2146341\",\"lat\":51.53463,\"pageid\":21305953,\"ns\":0,\"type\":\"city\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":1956.9,\"title\":\"IMT Gallery\",\"extract\":\"<p><b>IMT Gallery</b> (also known as IMT or Image Music Text) is a contemporary art gallery in Bethnal Green in London's East End.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>IMT Gallery was founded by Lindsay Friend in 2005 as IMT and launched with the first London solo exhibition by O Zhang.

Although she is best known for her photographs depicting Chinese youth, Zhang also makes paintings, short films and installations. She was trained as an oil painter at the Central Academy of Fine Art in Beijing before moving to London where she earned two MAs, the first in Fine Arts from Byam Shaw School of Art, and the second from the Royal College of Art in Photography. In 2004 Zhang moved to New York City where she has since lived and worked, making yearly returns to her native China. O Zhang is represented by CRG Gallery, NY, which will present her first American solo exhibition, <i>The World Is Yours (But Also Ours)</i>, in December, 2008. Zhang is also represented by P\\u00e9kin Fine Arts in Beijing and by FA Projects in London.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Childhood</h2>\\n<p>Zhang was born in the city of Guangzhou to English-translator parents who were forced, by the Chinese Cultural Revolution government, to move to the edge of Jishou, a village in the Hunan Province, soon after Zhang\\u2019s birth. In the countryside Zhang was exposed to and learned the language of ethnic minority groups like the Miao and the Tujia, and demonstrated her ability to adapt to situations where she was an \\u201coutsider.\\u201d Zhang remembers her childhood as \\u201cvery peaceful and colorful,\\u201d and notes that this is where she established the foundation for her aesthetic preferences.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n<p>Zhang attended schools in both China and the United Kingdom.</p>\\n<h3>China: Guangzhou and Beijing</h3>\\n<p>After six and a half years in Jishou, Zhang and her parents moved back to Guangzhou, which she considers to be her hometown. Zhang studied art at the Guangzhou Children\\u2019s Palace, the Guangzhou Academy of Art affiliate Middle School and at nineteen she left Guangzhou to attend the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. It was in Beijing that Zhang discovered photography, yet to her dismay the Central Academy did not have a photography department. Thus, Zhang taught herself photography technique after hours when she often snuck into the school studios with models in order to shoot. For her first series, <i>Masterpieces in my Eyes</i>, Zhang projected images of Western figurative masterpieces on nude female models and photographed them in an effort to impose, \\u201cthe male standards of female form\\u201d upon the models. Zhang graduated from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 2000.</p>\\n<h3>United Kingdom: London</h3>\\n<p>Zhang states that after graduating from the Central Academy she, \\u201cwanted to go abroad to see the outside world,\\u201d so she moved to London to study at the Byam Shaw School of Art and made two new series, <i>Water Moon</i> (2001\\u201302) and <i>Black Hair</i>. For <i>Water Moon</i>, Zhang employed the same method used in <i>Masterpieces in my Eyes</i>, however, she projected Ming Dynasty erotic paintings, which were outlawed in China, on faceless models. For <i>Black Hair</i>, Zhang photographed the wet hair of Asian women arranged in brush-like \\u201cstrokes\\u201d on their backs, mimicking Chinese characters. One critic writes of the series, \\u201cThe hair represents a significant and lasting genetic trait of Asian women and is therefore a symbol of survival, and Chinese writing is still a lasting tradition, yet both are out of context, the writing is not on paper and the woman is in a Western tub\\u201d. Zhang received her second MA in London at The Royal College of Art where she began to plan her next project that would involve her returning to China, <i>Horizon</i> (2004).</p>\\n<h2>Major Projects</h2>\\n<h3><i>Horizon</i></h3>\\n<p>Zhang\\u2019s inspiration for <i>Horizon</i> came from the Chinese Cultural Revolution slogan, \\u201crebellion is the rule.\\u201d Her goal was to produce a series of images that question current assumptions about the primacy of western power. The installation consists of a three row grid of photographs: on the top young Chinese girls squat on the hill looking down to the viewer, in the middle row\\u2019s girls eyes are at the viewer\\u2019s eye level and in the bottom row the girls are placed in a field of grass and look up to the viewer. The positioning of the horizon-line is consistent from photo to photo so that throughout each row the images merge to become one larger landscape. London critic JJ Charlesworth writes of the series:</p>\\n<dl><dd>\\n<dl><dd>O Zhang photographs small Chinese girls as they crouch down and stare back at the camera. Dominating the frame and the spectator, Zhang's little subjects offer oddly sinister and uncomprehending expressions. The West's self-conscious fascination with contemporary China reverberates through Zhang\\u2019s portraits, which co-opt the brand-logo myth of childhood innocence and global harmony, making her endearing subjects alien, monstrous and threatening.</dd>\\n</dl></dd>\\n</dl><h3><i>Daddy and I</i></h3>\\n<p>Zhang\\u2019s next series, <i>Daddy and I</i>, concerns itself with adolescent adopted Chinese girls and their adoptive American Caucasian fathers in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Oregon. Since 1991, when China loosened its adoption law, American families have adopted more than 55,000 Chinese children, almost all girls. Zhang, in a speech given on WPS1 Art Radio, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center on March 27 of 2008, discusses what questions motivated her to move forward with the <i>Daddy and I</i> project. She states:</p>\\n<dl><dd>\\n<dl><dd>By photographing adopted Chinese girls and their Western fathers in America, I try to capture the affection between a female child and an adult male. What is the nature of this complex relationship, especially when different ethnic and cultural backgrounds are introduced? \\u2026 Through the relationship of the emerging feminine power of the adolescent girl to the mature father, each image explores the unfathomable relation of the two inseparable, yet often divided cultures: East and West.</dd>\\n</dl></dd>\\n</dl><h4>Criticisms</h4>\\n<p>Some critics see the works as manipulative and claim that the girls look like \\u201cThai Lolitas,\\u201d while others argue that it is necessary to realize that the work feeds into common stereotypes and concepts of political correctness, thus making the images more than they are and asking the viewer not to submit their interpretations to stereotypes.</p>\\n<h3><i>The World is Yours (But Also Ours)</i></h3>\\n<p>Zhang\\u2019s most recent project, <i>The World is Yours (But Also Ours)</i>, completed in July\\u2013August 2008, will be shown at the Frieze Art Fair 2008 and the CRG Gallery, NY in December 2008. The images depict Chinese youth wearing American style tee-shirts featuring \\\"Chinglish\\\" statements and bordered with Chinese Cultural Revolution -era propaganda slogans. In doing so the series visually captures conflicts in modern day Chinese culture, such as communist legacy vs. recent rapid economic development and traditional culture vs. western popular culture, thus encapsulating the identity crisis facing Chinese youth and modern China.</p>\\n<h3>Current projects</h3>\\n<p>Zhang is currently working on a Chinese book that documents her experiences as a Chinese art student living in London titled, An Empire Where The Moon Light Never Fades. It will be published by Shanghai Art and Literature Publishing House in January 2009.[25]</p>\\n<p>http://www.amazon.com/Empire-Where-Light-Never-Chinese/dp/B001PRQ6ZA</p>\\n<p>O Zhang is working on a solo exhibition at the Queens Museum of Art. Cutting the Blaze to New Frontiers marks the 70th anniversary of the 1939-40 New York World\\u2019s Fair. The project harkens back to its inspirational theme \\u201cthe Dawn of a New Day\\u201d against the backdrop of today\\u2019s financial crisis. The artist assembled a miniature fair in collaboration with a group of Queens youth of immigrant parents. Having never visited their parents\\u2019 countries of origin, the young participants imagined their own \\u201cmotherland\\u201d as a national pavilion. Her mini-Fair reflects the increasingly complex cultural demographics of Queens and its inimitable vigor as the future of the nation. http://www.queensmuseum.org/o-zhang-cutting-the-blaze-to-new-frontiers</p>\\n<h3>Future projects</h3>\\n<p>Zhang is commissioned by Chinatown Art Space and Royal Opera House in London to make a short film about Anna May Wong (1905\\u201361), the first Asian-American actress who gained a star on Hollywood\\u2019s Walk of Fame. Of Anna And Dreams is a modern and artistic interpretation of her three dreams exploring three themes in her life: Fear, Identity Complex and Lust for Love.</p>\\n<p>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1634823/</p>\\n<h2>Awards</h2>\\n<p>Zhang is a participant in the Artists Residency Program at Queens Museum of Art, New York and is the recipient of fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center, and the Wilson Centre for Photography. She was awarded the Fuji Film Student Award and The Royal College of Photography Graduate Award and was nominated/short-listed for The Chinese Contemporary Art Award, Beck's Futures Award, The Creative Capital Awards and The Louis Comfort Biennial Award.

It is roughly in the area between Essex Road, Upper Street and Cross Street and either side of St Paul's Road. In 1253 land in the area was granted to the Canons of St Bartholomew\\u2019s Priory, Smithfield and became known as Canonbury. The area continued predominantly as open land until it was developed as a suburb in the early 19th century. In common with similar inner London areas, it suffered decline when the construction of railways in the 1860s enabled commuting into the city from further afield. The gentrification of the area from the 1950s included new developments to replace war-damaged properties in Canonbury Park North and South as well as restoration of older buildings.</p>\\n<p>East Canonbury is the south-eastern corner of the district, bordering on the Regents Canal. Parts of this area were transferred to the district from the London Borough of Hackney in a boundary adjustment (along the line of the northern tow-path of the canal), in 1993.</p>\\n<p>In the east is the New River Estate (formerly the Marquess Estate), a 1,200 dwelling council estate, completed in 1976 on 26 acres (110,000\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>), and designed by Darbourne &amp; Darke. A dark red brick, traffic free estate, it was praised as an example of municipal architecture, but acquired a bad reputation and has since been extensively redeveloped to improve security for residents.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Literary and artistic connections</h2>\\n\\n<p>George Orwell moved to 27b Canonbury Square in the autumn of 1944 - he and his wife having been bombed out of their previous flat, in Mortimer Crescent, on 28 June 1944. Evelyn Waugh lived at 17a Canonbury Square from 1928 to 1930. Charles Dickens wrote a Christmas story about a lamplighter in Canonbury, which features the Tower. Leslie Forbes, the travel and detective story writer, and amateur historian Gavin Menzies both live in the area.</p>\\n<h2>Places of interest</h2>\\n<ul><li><b>Canonbury Tower</b> - The manor house of Canonbury was constructed by William Bolton of St Bartholomew\\u2019s Priory between 1509 and 1532. At the dissolution it was granted to Thomas Cromwell. In the 1590s the manor house was rebuilt by Sir John Spencer, Lord Mayor of the City of London, including the construction of its tower. The tower has been occupied by many historical figures, including Francis Bacon and Oliver Goldsmith. The Tower Theatre Company was based here from 1953 to 2003. It is currently used as a Masonic research centre.</li>\\n<li><b>Canonbury Square</b> - An attractive square, developed between 1805 and 1830, it includes a variety of distinct styles. In 1812, when few properties had been built, the New North Road turnpike, now known as Canonbury Road, was constructed and bisects the square.

He played violin in the private band of George I and appeared as a harpsichordist from 1711, often appearing with William Corbett, James Paisible and later Matthew Dubourg. He was associated with Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre. From November 1718 until his death, he was organist at All Hallows, Bread Street, and was succeeded by John Stanley.</p>\\n<p>He wrote numerous keyboard arrangements of arias from popular operas of his time. These were published in France, the Netherlands and Germany as well as in England, and formed the basis of his musical reputation.

Babell's transcription of arias from Handel's opera <i>Rinaldo</i> includes 'Vo' far guerra', which Handel intended as a showpiece for his harpsichord playing and is quite remarkable in its virtuosity; Babell's transcription was made from his memory of how Handel improvised in performances. In 1894, Friedrich Chrysander published Babell's piano reduction of <i>Rinaldo</i> in the H\\u00e4ndel-Gesellschaft volume 48.</p>\\n<p>Babell also wrote original sonatas for violin or oboe and continuo, concertos and other miscellaneous works.

She was a member of the London Bohemian set of the inter-war years, claimed to have joined a criminal gang in Paris, was associated with occultist Aleister Crowley, and sat for Augustus John and Jacob Epstein. She became known as the \\\"Tiger Woman\\\". She adopted the name Betty May early in life, for reasons that are unclear.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n\\n<p>Betty May was born Betty Marlow Golding in Tidal Basin, Canning Town, London, in 1893. She was born into poverty. The only known account of her early life is her autobiography <i>Tiger Woman</i>, in which May writes that her father left the family when she was very young, leaving her mother to raise four children on the ten shillings a week she earned working long hours. The family had little furniture and no bed, so they slept on bundles of rags at night. May's mother was half French and was described as good-looking, with an olive complexion and dark eyes, features May claimed to have inherited. May described her grandmother, who lived nearby, as a formidable character who influenced May's life.</p>\\n<p>According to May, when the struggle of supporting four children became overwhelming, her mother sent May and her brother to live with their father. It was the first time May had ever seen him. He was an engineer by profession, but was living a life of idleness, drink and violence in a brothel run by his girlfriend in Limehouse. May wrote that she and her brother left the house after her father was arrested by his grandfather, an inspector of police, and later jailed. She first stayed with her paternal grandmother and then with her aunt and uncle on a barge, where she was washed frequently, taught the Lord's Prayer, and had her hair brushed more than she thought necessary but was otherwise ignored. She described herself as a \\\"little brown-faced marmoset ... and the only quick thing in this very slow world.\\\" Her aunt described her as \\\"a regular little savage\\\". May earned pennies singing and dancing for sailors on passing vessels. Some time later she was sent to live with another aunt who had a farm in Somerset where May attended the village school.</p>\\n<h2>Coster roots, gypsy style</h2>\\n<p>In her autobiography, May described her \\\"coster\\\" (costermonger) roots as being inherited from her grandmother, saying \\\"I am a true coster in my flamboyance and my love of colour, in my violence of feeling and its immediate response in speech and action. Even now I am often caught with a sudden longing regret for the streets of Limehouse as I knew them, for the girls with their gaudy shawls and heads of ostrich feathers, like clouds in a wind, and the men in their caps, silk neckerchiefs and bright yellow pointed boots in which they took such pride. I adored the swagger and the showiness of it all.\\\"</p>\\n<p>May was small, green-eyed, and dressed like a gypsy. She stated in her autobiography that soon after she arrived in London she \\\"could only afford one outfit, but every item of it was a different colour. Neither red nor green nor blue nor yellow nor purple was forgotten, for I loved them all equally, and if I was not rich enough to wear them separately ... I would wear them, like Joseph in the Bible, all at once! Colours to me are like children to a loving mother.\\\"</p>\\n<p>After she became involved with the London Bohemian set which included Augustus John, who also affected a gypsy style, Anthony Powell said: \\\"her hair tied up in a coloured handkerchief, she would not have looked out of place telling fortunes at a fair.\\\" Indeed, May's most popular song as an entertainer was \\\"The Raggle-Taggle Gypsies\\\" which she was said to have performed at Wally's, a subterranean club in Fitzroy Street, while removing her skirt and twirling it in front of her. She also sang \\\"Sigh No More Ladies\\\", \\\"Bonnie Earl O'Murray\\\" and \\\"There Lived a Girl in Amsterdam\\\".</p>\\n<h2>Caf\\u00e9 Royal set</h2>\\n\\n<p>Around 1910, May travelled to London where she quickly became familiar with the pubs and clubs of the West End. She became a regular at the Endell Street Club and the Caf\\u00e9 Royal which before World War I was a much different place from the later Caf\\u00e9 Royal. May described it as a real caf\\u00e9 with sawdust on the floor, cheap drinks and gilded decorations \\\"as gaudy and as bright as possible\\\" where you could get a plate of chips for sixpence. May said, \\\"The lights, the mirrors, the red plush seats, the eccentrically dressed people, the coffee served in glasses, the pale cloudy absinthe ... [I] felt as if I had strayed by accident into some miraculous Arabian palace\\\" continuing \\\"No duck ever took to water, no man to drink, as I to the Caf\\u00e9 Royal\\\".</p>\\n<p>She met the painter Augustus John and the sculptor Jacob Epstein. It was Epstein in particular who introduced her to other members of the Bohemian set, which including the \\\"Queen of Bohemia\\\" Nina Hamnett, prankster Horace de Vere Cole, heiress Nancy Cunard, painter William Orpen, Anna Wickham, Iris Tree and poet Ezra Pound, many of whom May knew.</p>\\n<p>At the Caf\\u00e9 and other central London venues, penniless models networked for work among London's artists. Those that could, like Betty May, also performed in order to make a living and in many cases women occupied a grey area between professional model and prostitute. The lives of many of May's contemporaries ended tragically. Among them were Lilian Shelley, also known as \\\"The Bug\\\" or \\\"The Pocket Edition\\\", who later killed herself; the suffragette Laura Grey, who overdosed on veronal in 1914; Sunita Devi who was reported to have been poisoned; Bobby Channing; and Lilian Browning. Others are identified only by first names or pseudonyms: \\\"The Limpet\\\", who was always falling in love; Eileen, who modelled for Augustus John and was shot by her lover; and Bunny, who received a six month sentence for bigamy and was later strangled by a man in Brixton. Other models May knew included Euphemia Lamb (Nina Forrest), wife of the painter Henry Lamb.</p>\\n<p>Apart from the Caf\\u00e9, May sang and danced at the Cabaret Theatre Club, which later became the Cave of the Golden Calf under the ownership of Madame Strindberg and featured frescoes by Epstein. According to May, when not entertaining, she was educated in taste by a distinguished older man she christened \\\"the Cherub\\\", with whom her relationship was strictly platonic.</p>\\n<h2>\\\"Tiger Woman\\\"</h2>\\n\\n<p>May gave her version of how she came to be known as the \\\"Tiger Woman\\\" in her 1929 autobiography of the same name. There is no independent confirmation of the story, but according to May, soon after meeting the Cherub, and before the outbreak of World War I in 1914, she became involved with a criminal known as the White Panther, a member of L'Apache Gang, whom she met in a bar. May wrote that she went with him to Paris and after arriving at the gang's lair was immediately set upon by the Panther's girl Hortense who saw May as a rival. May wrote of the moments after the Panther broke up the fight, \\\"I must say that I was in a frightful passion ... when White Panther dragged me by the hair to my feet, In an instant my teeth had met in his wrist ... <i>\\\"Tigre\\\"</i> he muttered\\\" and in this way May claimed to have earned the nickname \\\"Tiger Woman\\\".</p>\\n<p>Other sources, however, attribute the name to a tiger skin coat or outfit she wore or a party trick that involved crawling on all fours and drinking from a saucer like a cat. May herself, in the 1934 Crowley libel case, implied that the name had been made up specifically for her 1929 autobiography, <i>Tiger Woman: My Story</i>, saying: \\\"I am rather feline in looks. I thought perhaps it was rather a good name for me.\\\"</p>\\n<h2>Return to London</h2>\\n<p>By 1914, May was in London. According to Nina Hamnett, May and Lilian Shelley were the \\\"principal supports\\\" of the Crab Tree Club on Greek Street founded by Augustus John that year. The Crab Tree was particularly informal with customers making their own entertainment and helping themselves to food. May recalled that there was a pole from the floor to the ceiling which she often had to scamper up if she had played a trick on someone.</p>\\n<p>May writes in <i>Tiger Woman</i> that she was friendly with a young man called Richard who became ill and died after a canoeing accident while they were out together. She also wrote that she was later engaged to a barrister named Dick and while staying with his family in the country, she went for a stroll with a young farmer who claimed he loved her. According to May, he stumbled, and shot himself fatally in the head when his gun fired accidentally. There is no independent verification of either death however. May wrote in <i>Tiger Woman</i> that she returned to London almost immediately, her engagement to Dick was broken and quickly replaced by a new engagement to a former suitor, Miles L. Atkinson, (1888\\u20131917) who May knew as Bunny. Atkinson was a Cambridge University graduate and university blue who May had met prior to her visit to Paris. They were married at the Marylebone Registry Office in the third quarter of 1914.</p>\\n<h2>Cocaine</h2>\\n\\n<p>According to May, Atkinson was a cocaine user. A trainee doctor at a London hospital, he had access to as much cocaine as he wanted and May quickly began to use the drug herself. She would later comment that \\\"I learnt one new thing on my \\u00adhoneymoon \\u2013 to take drugs.\\\" May wrote that on their honeymoon they were thrown out of their hotel when the management became suspicious. On their return to London they became part of the unorthodox household of Stewart Gray (founder of the \\\"Back to the Land\\\" movement) in Ormonde Terrace, Primrose Hill. The house was occupied by a group of constantly changing artists and models, usually penniless. It was furnished in the most basic way possible in accordance with Gray's philosophy and was without utilities, even water.</p>\\n<p>May wrote that she and her husband attended dope parties where \\\"all forms of drug-taking used to be indulged in\\\". They became part of the circle of Billie Carleton and Ada Song Ping You, a Scotswoman who had married a Chinese man (Song Ping You) from whom she learned to use opium. After the war, Carleton was found dead, apparently of an overdose, and Ada Song Ping You was sentenced to five months in jail with hard labour for preparing opium for smoking and supplying it to Carleton.</p>\\n<p>Atkinson joined the Army in 1914 following the outbreak of the First World War, originally in the Motor Machine Gun Corps. According to May, they took a house in Bisley, Surrey while he was training and later May rented a flat in Richmond where she got a job in a shop which she left in a panic after handling Chinese hair-nets which she had read in the newspaper had given a woman leprosy. She moved back to London. According to May, Atkinson demanded a divorce, but died in action in France (1917) before it came through though marriage records appear to show her remarrying at the end of 1916 to a man by the name of Waldron.</p>\\n<p>May's drug use escalated. By her own account, soon she was taking 100 grains of cocaine per day, and morphia too. Her cocaine habit increased to 150 grains, causing her to become paranoid. She recalled that on one occasion a \\\"waiter brought me white coffee instead of black. Immediately I concluded that the whole world was against me.\\\"</p>\\n<h2>Second marriage</h2>\\n<p>According to <i>Tiger Woman</i>, sometime mid way through the First World War, May met an Australian army major called Roy (probably not his real name) who was in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and they were married at the Henrietta Street registry office. Marriage records show a Betty M. Golding marrying a man by the name of Waldron in St. Martin district, London, during the fourth quarter of 1916. According to May, Roy beat her if he found her using drugs, and on one occasion, returning home to find that she had attended a dope party that had lasted three days and three nights, he \\\"took off his Sam Browne belt and gave me the severest beating with it I have ever had\\\". She credited the beating as the start to breaking her addiction. Roy was sent to France and according to May they divorced after she found love letters written to Roy by a French girl. It is unclear, however, whether \\\"Roy\\\" was Waldron and there is no independent verification of May's relationship with Roy or of May's account of their marriage.</p>\\n<h2>Harlequin Club</h2>\\n\\n<p>After the end of the First World War (1918), May sat for Jacob Epstein for the first time at his home in Guilford Street in around 1919 or 1920. The resulting bronze bust with arms crossed was displayed at the Leicester Galleries in 1920. Epstein also completed a bronze head of Betty in 1921. It was also at about this time that she sat for Jacob Kramer's <i>The Sphinx</i> which had been commissioned from Kramer by a Bradford manufacturer who had met May at the Harlequin Club and been much taken with her. According to May, the sittings took place at the Harlequin as Kramer was too poor to be able to afford a studio. May wrote that Kramer fell in love with her and they became engaged but were prevented from marrying by Kramer's mother who would not let him marry a non-Jew. The painting was exhibited at the 1924/25 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley.</p>\\n<p>The Harlequin Club, at 55 Beak Street, off Regent Street, became a popular haunt of the poorer bohemians around this time. Betty May and her group became regulars. The club was based in the home of Yanni Papani who was also a waiter at the Caf\\u00e9 Royal. William Roberts remembered in his posthumously published (1990) memoirs the Harlequin's female customers \\\"whose vocal talents turned the place at times into a sort of <i>Caf\\u00e9 Chantant</i>, when the dark-skinned Helene sang the 'Raggle-Taggle Gypsies, O!' or Gypsy Lang sang Casey Jones the engine-driver's lament; with the vivacious Betty May, called the Tiger Woman, together with Dolores and the Snake Charmer (so called from her habit of carrying around a small basket of snakes) joining in the chorus.\\\"</p>\\n<h2><i>Dope-Darling</i></h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1919, \\\"Bunny\\\" Garnett, writing as Leda Burke, published a sensational novel titled <i>Dope-Darling: A Story of Cocaine</i> whose central female character \\\"Claire\\\" was loosely based on Betty May whom he knew well. The plot revolves around an idealistic young man \\\"Roy\\\" who is taken to a club near Fleet Street frequented by journalists. There he is enraptured by the singer, a sexually experienced young woman who had arrived in London aged sixteen just two years earlier, was duped into taking drugs and then into a life of prostitution. Roy marries Claire and tries to reform her but instead is drawn into drug use himself.</p>\\n<p>Garnett wrote of Claire:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>She was always asked to all the parties given in the flashy Bohemian world in which she moved. No dance, gambling party, or secret doping orgy was complete without her. Under the effect of cocaine which she took more and more recklessly, she became inspired by a wild frenzy, and danced like a Bacchante, drank off a bottle of champagne, and played a thousand wild antics.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The story concludes when Roy and Claire are separated by his military service during the First World War. Claire dies and Roy finds happiness with his childhood sweetheart.</p>\\n<h2>Abbey of Thelema</h2>\\n<p>In autumn 1922, May travelled to Sicily with her third husband Frederick Charles Loveday (later <i>Raoul</i> Loveday) whom she had married earlier that year in Oxford and who had become an acolyte of Aleister Crowley. Loveday was aged 20 or 23, had achieved a first in history from the University of Oxford, and had been published as a poet. They met Nina Hamnett in Paris en route. Hamnett later recalled in <i>Laughing Torso</i> that</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>he was very good-looking, but looked half dead ... He was very much intrigued with Crowley's views on magic. He had been very ill the year before and had had a serious operation. I had heard that the climate at Cefalu was terrible; heat, mosquitoes, and very bad food. The magical training I already knew was very arduous. I urged them not to go ... but they were determined.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Crowley thought Loveday his \\\"magical heir\\\" but condemned the marriage, saying that Loveday had committed the \\\"fatal folly of marrying a girl whom he had met in a sordid and filthy drinking den in Soho, called the Harlequin, which was frequented by self-styled artists and their female parasites\\\". Although Crowley thought the marriage a mistake, he praised May, describing her as a \\\"charming child, tender and simple of soul\\\" but suffering from the consequences of a childhood accident that had \\\"damaged her brain permanently so that its functions were discontinuous\\\" and saying that she had not helped matters by taking to cocaine at age 20. Despite this, Crowley admired her for subsequently curing herself of her addiction, which he said she had done by first switching to morphia and then to alcohol.</p>\\n<p>Crowley saw his offer of a job to Loveday as a way out of their precarious existence in London which he described as \\\"one filthy room in Fitzroy Street, a foul, frowsty, verminous den ... They were living from hand to mouth, with disaster eternally looming ahead\\\". (They also lived for a time in Beak Street, Soho.) May confirmed in testimony at Crowley's 1934 libel trial that she was supporting them both at the time by sitting as a model for \\u00a31 per day and that they were living in one furnished back room. Loveday had little money, no profession and many debts to tradesmen from his time at Oxford. Crowley believed the job would rescue Loveday from the \\\"vagabonds, squalid and obscene, who constituted the court of Queen Betty.\\\" In his <i>Confessions</i>, Crowley described, in typically censorious terms, May at work at the Harlequin Club just before she left for Italy: \\\"In a corner was his wife, three parts drunk, on the knees of a dirty-faced loafer, pawed by a swarm of lewd hogs, breathless with lust. She gave herself greedily to their gross and bestial fingerings and was singing in an exquisite voice ... an interminable smutty song, with a ribald chorus in which they all joined\\\".</p>\\n<p>Although relations between Crowley and May were always cool, Raoul participated enthusiastically in the magical rituals and studies that Crowley set. May took part only reluctantly in order not to be ejected from the Abbey and separated from Raoul. She did spend some time on her own with Crowley. They sometimes went rock-climbing, which was almost the only time they were on friendly terms.</p>\\n\\n<p>According to <i>Tiger Woman</i>, on one occasion May was exploring the Abbey when she came across a chest containing men's ties which were stiff from what she took to be dried blood. She asked Crowley about it and he claimed that they were the ties of Jack the Ripper who had worn a new one before each murder and who he had known and was still alive. Crowley claimed that the Ripper was a surgeon and a magician who had learned to make himself invisible. Crowley also believed that he could make himself invisible through magic.</p>\\n<p>As their stay went on, Raoul's health, never strong, worsened. He suffered a recurrence of malaria and was diagnosed with acute enteritis. According to May, he took part in a ritual in which he killed a cat and drank its blood. He died at the Abbey of Thelema on 16 February 1923, having drunk water from a stream that Crowley had warned about. May testified under oath in 1934 to the truth of the story about the cat but Crowley was equally emphatic that the incident never happened, testifying that \\\"There was no cat, no animal, no blood, and no drinking\\\".</p>\\n<p>Since their arrival in Sicily, May had been sending reports to the <i>Sunday Express</i> of activities at the Abbey which they had turned into articles. On her returned to England after the death of her husband she sold the rest of her story for an additional \\u00a3500 and it appeared in the <i>Sunday Express</i> and <i>John Bull</i>. The details were instrumental in further stoking outrage about Crowley's activities, which had been growing since the publication in 1922 of his <i>The Diary of a Drug Fiend</i>. Typical headlines about Crowley in <i>John Bull</i> were \\\"The King of Depravity\\\", \\\"A Man we'd Like to Hang\\\" and \\\"The Wickedest Man in the World\\\", the last being the soubriquet that stuck with Crowley for the rest of his life.</p>\\n<h2>Princess Waletka</h2>\\n<p>According to <i>Tiger Woman</i>, soon after selling her story, May was introduced to \\\"Princess Waletka\\\" at the Waldorf Hotel. The princess was a Vaudeville \\\"mind-reading\\\" entertainer who adopted the style of a native American. May wrote that she joined Waletka's British theatrical tour and soon after sailed with her for New York before returning to London.</p>\\n<h2>Fourth marriage</h2>\\n<p>According to May, after her return to England, she married for the fourth time, a journalist named Carol (probably not his real name). May described him as the assistant editor on a well-known sports paper. May wrote that they moved to live with Carol's mother in the countryside where Carol divided his time between field sports, writing about field sports and talking about them in the local pub.</p>\\n<p>May writes in <i>Tiger Woman</i>, that one day they visited a local rookery which Carol thought overcrowded. He spent hours shooting the birds and May had to break the necks of those that fell to the ground alive. She found the work disgusting. A rook-pie was made which she refused to eat. Soon after, Carol fell ill with a high temperature and vomiting. May left the house after her mother-in-law accused her of poisoning Carol with the meals she had prepared.</p>\\n<p>There is no independent verification, however, of this episode in May's life. By the 1930s, she was again describing herself as divorced.</p>\\n<h2>Model and muse</h2>\\n\\n<p>May became the model for Augustus John, and the sculptors Jacob Kramer and Jacob Epstein. She was drawn by Gerald Reitlinger and Michael Sevier. She had a rival by the name of Dolores who was also of striking appearance and it was not unusual for there to be friction, and even blows, between the two. Dolores died of cancer in 1934.</p>\\n<p>About July 1928, May had a brief affair with married Australian writer Jack Lindsay, who was also seeing Elza de Locre. They were together in the Fitzroy Tavern one evening and chanced to see poet Edgell Rickword. Lindsay recalled: \\\"I remember going over to Betty, who did not know him, and saying, 'It's Edgell Rickword, the person I most wanted to meet in England'.\\\" May soon left Lindsay for Rickword, though the two men became friends. Rickword wrote the poem \\\"The Lousy Astrologer's Present to his Sweetheart\\\", where the speakers are Rickword and May, which was published in the literary magazine <i>London Aphrodite</i>. The first verse, in the male voice, ran:</p>\\n\\n<p>In 1929 May, Rickword and two friends were arrested on a weekend trip to Dieppe in northern France after discovering that they did not have enough money to pay their hotel bill. They were all deported back to England. The hotel was next door to the local police station.</p>\\n<p>Poet, translator and cryptic crossword compiler for <i>The Observer</i> (\\\"Torquemada\\\") Edward Powys Mathers also wrote verse for Betty May, titling one work \\\"Oh, That We Two Were Betty Maying\\\".</p>\\n<p>In 1928 the Caf\\u00e9 Royal was renovated and its gilt and mirrors were replaced with a jazz age theme that caused it to lose some of its former atmosphere. By the 1930s, the bohemian crowd who once frequented the Caf\\u00e9 had largely decamped to North Soho, or Fitzrovia as it was beginning to be called, where they were centered on The Fitzroy, and to a lesser extent The Wheatsheaf in Rathbone Place. Dylan Thomas, a regular at both, wrote to his friend Bert Trick in 1934 that \\\"Betty May, is as you probably know, an artist's model \\u2013 who posed, though that is not perhaps the most correct word, for John, Epstein and the rest of the racketeers\\\". He told Trick that he planned to write an article in May's name, sell it to the <i>News of the World</i> and then ask her to pay him with her body.</p>\\n<p>In 1933, May was living with Hugh Sykes Davis at South Hill Park Gardens in Hampstead, London. The couple entertained Malcolm Lowry and Jan Gabrial there in the autumn that year. Soon after, May and her former lover Edgell Rickword took the couple to \\\"Kleinfled's\\\" (The Fitzroy Tavern), The Marquis of Granby and The Plough, and finally to Smokey Joe's, \\\"a non-alcoholic speakeasy-cum-lesbian pub\\\".</p>\\n<h2>Autobiography</h2>\\n<p>In 1929, Gerald Duckworth and Company published May's autobiography <i>Tiger Woman: My Story</i>. She promised it would be a frank account of her life but the names of many important characters were changed or missing. The quality of the writing led to suspicions that the book had been ghost-written by one of May's many journalistic and literary friends. During the 1934 Crowley stolen letters trial, May admitted that the book had been written by someone else, based partly on articles she had supplied to the newspapers, though she didn't say who the author was. Challenged about the truth of the book, she testified that \\\"My whole early life and my latter life is very true, but there is one little thing that is untrue\\\", adding that part of the book was written as \\\"padding\\\" and was not true.</p>\\n<p>The novelist Anthony Powell, then working for Duckworth, called it a \\\"somewhat bizarre work which I was responsible for Duckworth's publishing \\u2013 not without some trepidation on Balston's part\\\". Powell recalled, \\\"For some time she had been anxious to have certain newspaper articles (bestowing the sobriquet 'Tiger-Woman') cobbled into a book. A young journalist with whom she was then living was prepared to take this job on\\\". According to Powell, when May asked if Jacob Epstein would allow her to dedicate the book to him, he \\\"refused in a cross letter\\\".</p>\\n<p>Powell mostly dealt with May's ghostwriter by letter regarding the book but May visited him several times at Duckworth. Powell found that contrary to her tigerish reputation, she was \\\"diffident in conversation, articulating with the utmost refinement, [and] always behaved with complete decorum\\\". On meeting Powell's publishing colleague A.G. Lewis, who was himself nervous of May, she was terrified.</p>\\n<p>Soon after publication, Aleister Crowley took Powell to lunch and expressed his dissatisfaction with Duckworth for publishing the book. Under British law, however, Crowley would only have been able to sue the <i>Sunday Express</i>, where most of the content was originally serialised in 1923, but too much time had passed. The book was reprinted in 2014 to promote the upcoming musical about May's life, written by Celine Hispiche.</p>\\n<h2>Aleister Crowley libel suit</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1934 Betty May was the principal witness in the suit brought by Aleister Crowley against Nina Hamnett for libel in her book <i>Laughing Torso</i> which had alleged that a child had disappeared at the Abbey. By then, May was Mrs Betty May Sedgwick. May testified to the ritual sacrifice of a cat and that her then husband Raoul Loveday had to kill the cat and drink a cup of its blood. As a result of her evidence, May's character and truthfulness were attacked in a long cross-examination by J.P. Eddy, counsel for the plaintiff. May stated, in response to allegations of drug use, that she had taken cocaine for the first time at 18 but not after 25 and she had not \\\"drugged\\\" for years. Asked whether the cats in Italy were wild and destructive, May replied that she only knew two and they were both very charming.</p>\\n<p>Under cross-examination, May repeatedly faced accusations from Eddy that her testimony had been bought. He produced letters to May from the defendant's solicitors about the expenses she would receive in connection with the case. May claimed that the letters had been stolen from her with the clear implication that they had been stolen by or for Aleister Crowley. The letters were retained by the court. The case was stopped by the Jury and dismissed by the Judge.</p>\\n<h2>Stolen letters</h2>\\n<p>In June 1934, Aleister Crowley was arrested in his solicitor's office on suspicion of received stolen goods to the value of 7 1/2d. These were the letters belonging to Betty May dealing with the libel case and her book. At the Old Bailey trial in July that year, May testified that the letters had been stolen from her attach\\u00e9 case by a friend, Captain Eddie Cruze, with whom she had been living at Seymour Street in June the previous year. It emerged in evidence that Cruze had sold the letters to Crowley for \\u00a35. Cruze's whereabouts were unknown. Crowley was convicted and bound over for two years.</p>\\n<p>During the cross-examination, counsel for Crowley tried to impugn May's character, asking her if she thought it fraudulent to publish <i>Tiger Woman</i> as her own work when she now admitted that she was not the author. May replied that she had not thought about it. She said that part of the work was written from articles she had provided to the newspapers and it was partly true, but when pressed admitted that much of it was fabrication.</p>\\n<p>Around the same time, a popular newspaper printed a photograph with the caption \\\"Miss Nina Hamnett, the artist and author of <i>Laughing Torso</i>, takes a walk in the Park with a friend\\\". The picture, however, showed Betty May. Both May and Hamnett were able to extract \\u00a325 from the newspaper within hours of each other on the grounds that both had been libelled. A party at the Fitzroy, funded by the windfall, lasted all day.</p>\\n<h2>Murder of Douglas Bose</h2>\\n<p>In 1936, Douglas Bose (born 1915), a writer and practitioner of black magic was murdered by book-reviewer Douglas Burton (aged 30). Bose had been living with Sylvia Williams (known as Sylvia Gough), a diamond heiress and former dancer who had appeared in <i>The Ziegfeld Follies</i> in New York. Now in London, she had modelled for and become the lover of Augustus John. At Burton's trial, Williams explained that she and Bose had had a stormy relationship and he once gave her a black eye. All three of them, Bose, Burton and Williams, were present at a dinner party in February 1936 at a studio in Canonbury when Burton had said that it was a mistake to give a woman a black eye. Sometime later, after dinner, Burton launched an attack on Bose with a sculptor's hammer or mallet he had picked up. Bose subsequently died from his injuries.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Betty_May_tiger_woman.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q17479389\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":7445089,\"title\":\"David Simon, Baron Simon of Highbury\",\"text\":\"<p><b>David Alec Gwyn Simon, Baron Simon of Highbury</b> CBE (born 24 July 1939) is a British businessman.</p>\\n<p>He graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1961 and joined British Petroleum as a management trainee, became chief executive of BP Oil International in 1982, managing director of BP in 1986, chief executive of BP from 1992 to 1995 and chairman from 1995 to 1997.</p>\\n<p>In the early years of his career he spent some time at the elite business school INSEAD.

In March 2007 Jessica Lack of The Guardian described him as, \\\"the master of lo fi British art\\\". Harry William Pye was born in London in 1973. He completed a foundation course at Camberwell School of Art in 1991. He then studied printmaking at Winchester School of Art from 1992 to 1995. In his second year he stopped painting and printmaking and began making films. His first films were interviews with artist and tutor Bruce McLean. He has interviewed many other artists such as Humphrey Ocean, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Wolfgang Tillmans and Keith Tyson for various publications including The Face Turps Banana and Untitled. He has also edited and published numerous art based fanzines of his own, most notably, \\\"Harry Pye's FRANK Magazine\\\" which ran from 1995 to 2000. Since 2005 Pye has written a column about the London art scene for the timeless Estonian newspaper, Epifanio (See: www.epifanio.eu) as well as being the editor of The Rebel magazine.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Overview</h2>\\n<p>In May 2000 he was invited to curate an exhibition at Glassbox in Paris, France. The name of this show was, \\\"It May Be Rubbish, But It's <i>British</i> Rubbish\\\". In 2002 he curated a show at The Bart Wells Institute in London Fields called, \\\"Viva Pablo\\\". (Reviewed by Fisun Guner for the Metro Newspaper, Thursday, 29 August 2002.) A year later he organised a group show with 100 artists called, 100 MOTHERS which took place at The Oh Art Gallery in The Oxford House of Bethnal Green and then toured to the North Edinburgh Art Centre in Scotland. This exhibit was also included in The Other Art Fair in 2013. In November 2006 he put together, \\\"For Peel\\\" at the NOMOREGREY gallery in Shoreditch. This exhibition was a tribute to the D.J. John Peel and consisted of more than 60 artists including Jessica Voorsanger, Sarah Doyle and Cathy Lomax all of whom had made work relating to a band or singer that John Peel had discovered or championed. Pye didn't contribute any artwork of his own to these exhibitions. According to press release material he only began making paintings of his own in 2004 having been inspired by a Royal Academy exhibition of Philip Guston and a show about Mathias Kauage at the Horniman Museum which both took place in this same year.</p>\\n<p>Pye's first solo show took place at Sartorial Contemporary Art in Notting Hill in February 2007. The name of his show was, \\\"Me, Me, Me\\\". As well as more than twenty paintings the show featured a thirty minute video made in collaboration with artist Gordon Beswick and comedy writers and performers Richard Herring and Robin Ince.</p>\\n<p>Pye has made many collaborative paintings with other artists including Gordon Beswick, Rowland Smith, Marcus Cope, Kes Richardson, James Jessop, Billy Childish, Frank Sidebottom, Sarah Sparkes, Liz Murray, Geraldine Swayne, and Mat Humphrey. Almost half of the paintings in the \\\"Me, Me, Me\\\" show were collaborations with Rowland Smith who Pye has known since his school days.</p>\\n<p>In April 2007 Pye won first prize in a competition to paint a portrait of Tony Blair. The competition was organised by The Daily Mirror. The judges were artists Gilbert and George.</p>\\n<p>In April 2008 Pye had several of his paintings featured in an exhibition called, \\\"Everyday Life\\\" at The Tom Christoffersen gallery in Denmark. In the same month he had a solo show at The Thomas Cohn Gallery \\u2013 a 5,500-square-foot (510\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>) space in S\\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. In June Pye curated a group exhibition called \\\"Poetic Licence\\\" at the Crimes Town Gallery in Stoke Newington. The show featured drawings and paintings inspired by poems and visitors to the gallery could only gain entry if they brought with them a poem that had moved or inspired them. Artists taking part in the project included Lloyd Durling, Marenka Gabeler, Marisol Malatesta Mark Mcgowan, John Moseley, and Edward Ward. In September Pye and Rowland Smith exhibited several paintings they had made in collaboration in a show called Fresh Air Machine at a new Shoreditch art space called Calvert 22. The show was supported by the Outset organisation and was part of the Concrete and Glass festival.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q5671770\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1}],\"lon\":-0.0796,\"wikidata\":\"Q5185495\",\"lat\":51.5624,\"pageid\":20296684,\"ns\":0,\"type\":\"landmark\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":2013.5,\"title\":\"London Chest Hospital\",\"extract\":\"<p>The <b>London Chest Hospital</b>, located in Bethnal Green in London, adjacent to Victoria Park, is a hospital run by the Barts Health NHS Trust.</p>\\n<p>It has a national reputation for cardiac treatment.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>It was founded in 1848 by Thomas Bevill Peacock, and first opened in 1855.</p>\\n<p>On 1 April 2010, LCH Radio broadcast its first shows to the hospital's patients.

Keetch joined the Liberal Party while still at school, and chaired the Hereford Young Liberals and the West Midlands Region Young Liberals, as well as being the election agent for the Liberals in Hereford in 1983. He was elected to Hereford City Council in 1983 at the age of 21, making him the then-youngest city councillor in the UK, and served two years before resigning to move to London. His first jobs were in banking and financial services, before moving to the water hygiene industry and Franklin Hodge self-assembly water tanks. He moved to London for Hodge in 1985, but soon left to become a self-employed public affairs consultant. Since 1996, he has been a non-executive director of the London Computer Company.</p>\\n<h2>Political career</h2>\\n<p>Keetch was selected as Lib Dem candidate for Hereford in 1994 and was elected to be the city's MP at the 1997 general election. He was a junior Liberal Democrat spokesman for Foreign Affairs from 1999\\u20132001, a frontbench spokesman on Defence from October 1999 until the May 2005 general election, and a junior party Whip until 2010.</p>\\n<p>In July 2005, Keetch succeeded Sharon Bowles MEP as Chair of the Liberal International British Group. He also sat on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. He founded the Cider All-Party Parliamentary Group.</p>\\n<p>Keetch had comfortably captured his traditionally-marginal seat by 6,648 votes when he gained it from the Conservatives in 1997, but his majority dropped to 968 votes when he was re-elected in 2001, and when he won a third term in 2005 it was by 962 votes. Keetch announced in December 2006 that he would step down at the 2010 general election. In 2007 the Liberal Democrats selected Sarah Carr as their candidate for the revised Hereford and South Herefordshire constituency at the 2010 general election, but the Lib Dems lost the seat by 2,481 votes.</p>\\n<h2>Expenses and rule breaches</h2>\\n<p>In 2008, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> noted that Keetch \\\"never knowingly underspent\\\", and it mocked his \\\"expense-fuelled forays to John Lewis\\\", including \\\"such indispensable items as a cheese grater, three large bottle stoppers and a white pudding basin.\\\" During the 2009 United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, the <i>Hereford Times</i> noted that in the past year he had claimed \\u00a3142,385, including \\u00a387,000 on staffing costs (part of which would have gone to his wife, who worked for him), and \\u00a323,351.74 in second home allowances (the maximum permitted at the time). Keetch missed 9 out of 10 parliamentary votes on MPs' expenses. The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> recorded that his \\\"mortgage jumped from \\u00a3145,000 to \\u00a3300,000 when he sold a flat in Stockwell in London last year and moved around the corner. The new flat was furnished with a sofa-bed costing \\u00a3690 and a wardrobe at \\u00a3624.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In March 2010, a BBC investigation showed that Keetch had breached House of Commons rules relating to declaring outside interests. In 2005, he twice visited Gibraltar, firstly paid for by the Liberal Party of Gibraltar and secondly paid for by the Gibraltar government, yet when he asked two parliamentary questions and signed three Early Day Motions relating to Gibraltar, he failed to declare either of these interests. Similarly, he visited Korea in 2006 paid for by the government, but failed to declare this when he subsequently signed an Early Day Motion on Korea.</p>\\n<h2>Personal life</h2>\\n<p>He married Claire Elizabeth Baker on 21 December 1991 and together they have one son. She worked for her husband as a constituency case worker. They are now divorced.</p>\\n<p>On 8 July 2007 he was taken seriously ill whilst travelling to the United States on a flight. The pilot turned the aeroplane back to London and he was admitted to London Chest Hospital. Doctors eventually diagnosed him with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation and fitted an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q7151723\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":15227427,\"title\":\"Hasnat Khan\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Hasnat Ahmad Khan</b>, FRCS (born 1 April 1959) is a British heart and lung surgeon.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life and education</h2>\\n<p>Khan was born on 1 April 1959 in an affluent Pathan family from Jhelum, Punjab in Pakistan.

After three years, he turned professional in 2005. He made his debut for Arsenal in the League Cup, but played only one other professional match for the club. Following a loan spell with Birmingham City, he made the move permanent in 2007. He stayed with Birmingham City for one additional year, and left after making more than 70 appearances and making his England under-21 debut while with the team. He joined Bolton Wanderers in 2008.</p>\\n<p>In March 2012, Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest during a televised FA Cup match between Bolton and Tottenham Hotspur, from which he recovered despite his heart having stopped for 78 minutes.

After a slow start, his energetic style of play, which has been likened to that of his hero Patrick Vieira, established him as a regular starter in central midfield. The fans were equally impressed, voting him their Young Player of the Season.</p>\\n<p>On 11 May 2007 Muamba made his move to Birmingham City permanent, signing a three-year contract for a fee reported by the club of \\u00a34\\u00a0million. He scored his first goal for the club, a close-range volley from a corner, on 12 March 2008 in a 4\\u20132 defeat at Portsmouth.

He then scored his first ever goal in the League Cup, against his old club Arsenal in a 2\\u20131 defeat.</p>\\n<h4>Cardiac arrest on the pitch</h4>\\n<p>On 17 March 2012, Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed during the first half of an FA Cup quarter-final match between Bolton and Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. After receiving lengthy attention on the pitch from medical personnel\\u00a0\\u2013 including a consultant cardiologist who was at the game as a fan\\u00a0\\u2013 Muamba was taken to the specialist coronary care unit at the London Chest Hospital. Bolton manager Owen Coyle and club captain Kevin Davies accompanied Muamba in the ambulance.

It was while at University that he first adopted the persona of Jodie Harsh to make money through nightclub jobs.</p>\\n<h2>Rise to Fame</h2>\\n<p>Originally wanting to become a journalist, a career in promotion was kicked off after a much hyped birthday event at the Soho Revue Bar, attended by Alexander McQueen, Kate Moss, Amy Winehouse and Boy George, leading to the management requesting Harsh start his own club night Circus. This came after four years working in clubs such as The End in London and Space in Ibiza. In late 2010, Harsh started an infamous weekday club nights called \\\"Room Service\\\". The brand became a success and runs weekly in London and New York, as well as occasionally in Amsterdam, Tel Aviv, Moscow, Sydney, Paris and Ibiza.</p>\\n<h2>Notoriety</h2>\\n<p>Harsh has become a celebrity in his own right and can count Amy Winehouse, Kelly Osbourne, Lily Allen and Jaime Winstone as friends amongst other celebrity types. Despite the similarity in name, Harsh states that she does not keep in contact with the glamour model Jodie Marsh, although has met her on occasion.</p>\\n<h2>Clubs</h2>\\n<p>Circus, later renamed This Is...Circus, was Harsh's monthly club night, It opened in 2006 and moved around venues such Soho Revue Bar, Cafe De Paris and Paramount at the top of the Centre Point building. It closed in 2012 with a stage at Lovebox festival featuring a show including Felix da Housecat, Mika and Dev. Jodie has said she felt the brand was 'in danger of becoming tired' and it was time to 'quit while we're ahead' to focus on opening Room Service around the world. In its heyday the night was notorious for attracting a fashionable celebrity crowd, and popped up as a cultural voice in Vogue and i-D magazine. Guest DJ sets by the likes of Peaches, Siouxsie Sioux, Roisin Murphy, Robyn, Friendly Fires, Kissy Sellout, William Orbit, The xx and Fenech-Soler were random and unnanounced. The Circus team programmed a stage at Lovebox Festival for two years running and collaborated with world-famous fashion photographer Tim Bret-Day on an exhibition project of gargantuous proportions in 2011. What started off as a weekly Soho hangout had now flourished into a multifaceted brand, crossing over all spectrums of popular culture, branching out over not only clubland but the performing and visual arts, fashion and music industries.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q6207970\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":11071519,\"title\":\"Sav Remzi\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Sav Remzi</b> is a music producer and consultant.

Jones, who was a local politician and Apostolic clergyman. Jones and her siblings were raised by grandparents, as her parents were working in the United States. Jones had a strict upbringing under the influence of Jamaica's Pentecostal church and went to church three times a week. Both sides of her family were religious; there were many bishops in her family, including her grandfather, stepfather, and Noel, her brother.</p>\\n<p>As a child, shy Jones had only one schoolfriend and was teased by classmates for her \\\"skinny frame\\\", but she excelled at sports and found solace in the nature of Jamaica.</p>\\n<p>When she was 13, she and her siblings moved to Syracuse, New York to join her parents. Jones continued her schooling and after she graduated, enrolled at Syracuse University majoring in Spanish. Halfway through college, Jones was approached by a drama professor who proposed that she work with him in a play he was putting on in Philadelphia; Jones left with him. She moved back to New York at 18 and signed on as a model with Wilhelmina Modelling agency. She moved to Paris in 1970. The Parisian fashion scene was receptive to Jones' unusual androgynous, bold, dark-skinned appearance. Yves St. Laurent, Claude Montana, and Kenzo Takada hired her for runway modelling, and she appeared on the covers of <i>Elle</i>, <i>Vogue</i>, and <i>Stern</i> working with Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer. Jones also modelled for Azzedine Alaia, and was frequently photographed promoting their line. While modelling in Paris, she shared an apartment with Jerry Hall and Jessica Lange. Hall and Jones frequented Club Sept, one of Paris's most popular gay clubs of the 1970s and '80s, and socialised with Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld.</p>\\n<h3>1974\\u201379: Transition to music, and early releases</h3>\\n<p>Jones was signed by Island Records, who put her in the studio with disco record producer, Tom Moulton. Moulton worked at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, and <i>Portfolio</i>, was released in 1977. The album featured three songs from Broadway musicals, \\\"Send in the Clowns\\\" by Stephen Sondheim from <i>A Little Night Music</i>, \\\"What I Did for Love\\\" from <i>A Chorus Line</i> and \\\"Tomorrow\\\" from <i>Annie</i>. The second side of the album opens up with a seven-minute reinterpretation of \\u00c9dith Piaf's \\\"La Vie en rose\\\" followed by three new recordings, two of which were co-written by Jones, \\\"Sorry\\\", and \\\"That's the Trouble\\\", The album finished with \\\"I Need a Man\\\", Jones' first club hit. The artwork to the album was designed by Richard Bernstein, an artist for <i>Interview</i>.</p>\\n<p>In 1978, Jones and Moulton made <i>Fame</i>, an immediate follow-up to <i>Portfolio</i>, also recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. The album featured another reinterpretation of a French classic, \\\"Autumn Leaves\\\" by Jacques Pr\\u00e9vert. The Canadian edition of the vinyl album included another French language track, \\\"Comme un oiseau qui s'envole\\\", which replaced \\\"All on a Summers Night\\\"; in most locations this song served as the B-side of the single \\\"Do or Die\\\".</p>\\n<p>In the North American club scene, <i>Fame</i> was a hit album and the \\\"Do or Die\\\"/\\\"Pride\\\"/\\\"Fame\\\" side reached top 10 on both the US Hot Dance Club Play and Canadian Dance/Urban charts. The album was released on compact disc in the early 1990s, but soon went out of print. In 2011, it was released and remastered by Gold Legion, a record company that specialises in reissuing classic disco albums on CD.</p>\\n<p><i>Muse</i> was the last of Jones' disco albums. The album features a re-recorded version \\\"I'll Find My Way to You\\\", which Jones released three years prior to <i>Muse</i>. Originally appearing on the 1976 Italian film, <i>Colt 38 Special Squad</i>) in which Jones had a role as a club singer, Jones also recorded a song called \\\"Again and Again\\\" which was featured on the film. Both songs were produced by composer Stelvio Cipriani. Icelandic keyboardist Thor Baldursson who arranged most of the album and also sang duet with Jones on the track \\\"Suffer\\\" had previously worked in Munich, with disco stars such as Silver Convention, Boney M., Donna Summer, Amanda Lear and Giorgio Moroder. Like the last two albums, the cover art is by Richard Bernstein. Like <i>Fame</i>, <i>Muse</i> was later released by Gold Legion.</p>\\n<h3>1980\\u201385: International breakthrough, <i>Nightclubbing</i>, and movie career</h3>\\n<p>With \\\"Anti-disco sentiment\\\" spreading, Jones, with the aid of the Compass Point All Stars transitioned into \\\"New Wave\\\", with the 1980 release of <i>Warm Leatherette (album)</i>. The album included covers of songs by The Normal (\\\"Warm Leatherette\\\"), The Pretenders (\\\"Private Life\\\"), Roxy Music (\\\"Love is the Drug\\\"), Smokey Robinson (\\\"The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game\\\"), Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (\\\"Breakdown\\\") and Jacques Higelin (\\\"Pars\\\"). Sly Dunbar revealed that the title track was also the first to be recorded with Jones. Tom Petty wrote the lyrics to \\\"Breakdown\\\", and he also wrote the third verse of Jones' reinterpretation. The album included one song co-written by Jones, \\\"A Rolling Stone\\\". Originally, \\\"Pull Up to the Bumper\\\" was to be included on the album, but its R&amp;B sound did not fit with the rest of the material. The album charted in the UK and the USA, and to her followers, is the highest-rated of all her studio releases.</p>\\n<p>The 1981 release of <i>Nightclubbing</i> included Jones' covers of songs by Flash and the Pan (\\\"Walking in the Rain\\\"), Bill Withers (\\\"Use Me\\\"), Iggy Pop, and David Bowie (\\\"Nightclubbing\\\"), and \\u00c1stor Piazzolla (\\\"I've Seen That Face Before\\\"). Three songs were co-written by Jones, \\\"Feel Up\\\", \\\"Art Groupie\\\", and \\\"Pull Up to the Bumper\\\", Sting wrote \\\"Demolition Man\\\"; he later recorded it with the Police on the album, <i>Ghost in the Machine</i>. \\\"I've Done It Again\\\" was written by Marianne Faithfull. The strong rhythm featured on <i>Nightclubbing</i>, was produced by Compass Point All Stars, including Sly and Robbie, Wally Badarou, Mikey Chung, Uziah \\\"Sticky\\\" Thompson, and Barry Reynolds. The album entered in the top 5 in four countries, and became Jones' highest-ranking record on the US Billboard mainstream albums and R&amp;B charts.</p>\\n<p><i>Nightclubbing</i> claimed the number one slot on NME's Album of the Year list. Slant Magazine listed the album at No. 40 on its list of Best Albums of the 1980s. <i>Nightclubbing</i> is now widely considered Jones' best studio album. The album's cover art is a painting of Jones, by Jean-Paul Goude. Jones is presented as a man wearing an Armani suit jacket, with a cigarette in her mouth and a flattop haircut. To promote the album, Jones appeared alongside psychotherapist Sonja Vetter, and slapped chat show host Russell Harty live on air after he turned to interview other guests and she felt she was being ignored.</p>\\n<p>Having already recorded two reggae-oriented albums under the production of Compass Point All Stars, Jones went to Nassau, Bahamas in 1982, and recorded <i>Living My Life (album)</i>; the album resulted in Jones' final contribution to the Compass Point trilogy, with only one cover, Melvin Van Peebles's \\\"The Apple Stretching\\\". The rest were original songs; \\\"Nipple to the Bottle\\\" was co-written with Sly Dunbar, and, apart from \\\"My Jamaican Guy\\\", the other tracks were collaborations with Barry Reynolds. Despite receiving a limited single release, the title track, was left off the album. Further session outtakes included the track \\\"Man Around the House\\\" (Jones, Reynolds), and a cover of Johnny Cash's \\\"Ring of Fire\\\", both of which were included on the 1998 compilation <i>Private Life: The Compass Point Sessions</i>. The album's cover art resulted from another Jones/Goude collaboration; the artwork has been described as being as famous as the music on the record. It features Jones' disembodied head cut out from a photograph and pasted onto a white background. Jones' head is sharpened, giving her head and face an angular shape. A piece of plaster is pasted over her left eyebrow, and her forehead is covered with drops of sweat.</p>\\n<p>Jones' 3 albums under the production of the Compass Point All Stars resulted in Jones' <i>One Man Show</i>, a performance art/pop theatre presentation devised by Jean-Paul Goude and Jones, in which she also performed tracks from the albums <i>Portfolio</i> (\\\"La Vie en rose\\\"), <i>Warm Leatherette</i>, (\\\"Private Life\\\", \\\"Warm Leatherette\\\"), <i>Nightclubbing</i>, (\\\"Walking in the Rain\\\", \\\"Feel Up\\\", \\\"Demolition Man\\\", \\\"Pull Up to the Bumper\\\", and \\\"I've Seen That Face Before (Libertango))\\\", and from <i>Living My Life</i>, \\\"My Jamaican Guy\\\", and the album's title track. Jones dressed in elaborate costumes and masks \\u2013 in the opening sequence as a gorilla \\u2013 and alongside a series of Grace Jones lookalikes. A video version, filmed live in London and New York City and completed with some studio footage, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Long-Form Music Video next year.</p>\\n<p>After the release of <i>Living My Life</i>, Jones took on the role of Zula the Amazonian in <i>Conan the Destroyer</i> (1984) and was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 1985, Jones starred as May Day, henchman to main antagonist Max Zorin in the 14th James Bond film <i>A View to a Kill</i>; Jones was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. That same year, she was featured on the Arcadia song \\\"Election Day\\\". Jones was among the many stars to promote the Honda Scooter; other artists included Lou Reed, Adam Ant, and Miles Davis. Jones also, with her boyfriend Dolph Lundgren posed nude for <i>Playboy</i>.</p>\\n<p>After Jones' success as a mainstream actress, she returned to the studio to work on <i>Slave to the Rhythm</i>, the last of her recordings for Island. Bruce Woolley, Simon Darlow, Stephen Lipson and Trevor Horn wrote the material, and it was produced by Horn and Lipson. It was a concept album that featured several interpretations of the title track. The project was originally intended for Frankie Goes to Hollywood as a follow-up to \\\"Relax\\\", but was given to Jones. All eight tracks on the album featured excerpts from a conversation with Jones, speaking about many aspects of her life. The interview was conducted by journalist Paul Morley. The album features voice-overs from actor Ian McShane reciting passages from Jean-Paul Goude's biography <i>Jungle Fever</i>. <i>Slave to the Rhythm</i> was successful in German speaking countries and the Netherlands, where it secured top 10 placings. It reached number 12 on the UK Albums Chart in November 1985. It was the second highest ranking album released by Jones. Jones earned an MTV Video Music Award nomination for the title track's music video.</p>\\n<p>After her success with <i>Slave to the Rhythm</i>, Island released <i>Island Life</i>, her first best-of compilation, which featured songs from most of Jones' releases with Island, <i>Portfolio</i>, <i>Fame</i>, <i>Warm Leatherette</i>, <i>Nightclubbing</i>, <i>Living My Life</i>, and <i>Slave to the Rhythm</i>. American writer and journalist Glenn O'Brien wrote the essay for the inlay booklet. The compilation charted in the UK, New Zealand, and the United States. The artwork on the cover of the compilation was of another (Jones/Goude) collaboration; it featured Jones' celestial body in a montage of separate images, following Goude's ideas on creating credible illusions with his cut-and-paint technique. The body position is anatomically impossible.</p>\\n<p>The artwork, a piece called \\\"Nigger Arabesque\\\" was originally published in the <i>New York</i> magazine in 1978, and was used as a backdrop for the music video of Jones' hit single \\\"La Vie en rose\\\". The artwork has been described as \\\"one of pop culture's most famous photographs\\\". The image was also parodied in Nicki Minaj's 2011 music video for \\\"Stupid Hoe\\\", mimicking the pose.</p>\\n<h3>1986\\u201389: <i>Slave to the Rhythm</i>, <i>Island Life</i>, and continued acting roles</h3>\\n<p>After <i>Slave to the Rhythm</i> and <i>Island Life</i>, Jones started to record again under a new contract with Manhattan Records, which resulted in <i>Inside Story</i>, Jones teamed up with music producer Nile Rodgers of Chic, who Jones had previously tried to work with during the disco era. The album was recorded at Skyline Studios in New York and post-produced at Atlantic Studios and Sterling Sound. <i>Inside Story</i> was the first album Jones produced, which resulted in heated disputes with Rodgers. Musically, the album was more accessible than her previous albums with the Compass Point All Stars, and explored different styles of pop music, with undertones of jazz, gospel, and Caribbean sounds. All songs on the album were written by Jones and Bruce Woolley. Richard Bernstein teamed up with Jones again to provide the album's artwork. <i>Inside Story</i> made the top 40 in several European countries. The album was Jones' last entry to date on US <i>Billboard</i> 200 albums chart. The same year, Jones starred as Katrina, an Egyptian queen vampire in the vampire film <i>Vamp</i>. For her work in the film, Jones was awarded a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. The following year, Jones appeared in two films, <i>Straight to Hell</i>, and Mary Lambert's <i>Siesta</i>, for which Jones was nominated for Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress. <i>Bulletproof Heart</i> was released in 1989, produced by Chris Stanley, who co-wrote, and co-produced the majority of the songs, and was featured as a guest vocalist on \\\"Don't Cry Freedom\\\". Robert Clivill\\u00e9s and David Cole of C+C Music Factory produced some tracks on the album.</p>\\n<h3>1990\\u20132004: <i>Boomerang</i>, movie soundtrack recordings, and artist collaborations</h3>\\n<p>In 1990, Jones appeared as herself in the documentary, <i>Superstar: The Life and Times of Andy Warhol</i>. 1992 saw Jones starring as Helen Strang\\u00e9, in the Eddie Murphy film <i>Boomerang</i>, for which she also contributed the song \\\"7 Day Weekend\\\" to its soundtrack. Jones released two more soundtrack songs in 1992; \\\"Evilmainya\\\", recorded for the film <i>Freddie as F.R.O.7</i>, and \\\"Let Joy and Innocence Prevail\\\" for the film <i>Toys</i>. In 1994, she was due to release an electro album titled <i>Black Marilyn</i> with artwork featuring the singer as Marilyn Monroe. \\\"Sex Drive\\\" was released as the first single in September 1993, but due to unknown reasons the record was eventually shelved. The track \\\"Volunteer\\\", recorded during the same sessions, leaked in 2009.</p>\\n<p>1996 Saw Jones releasing \\\"Love Bites\\\", an up-tempo electronic track to promote the Sci-Fi Channel's <i>Vampire Week</i>, which consisted of a series of vampire-themed films aired on the channel in early November 1996. The track features Jones singing from the perspective of a vampire. The track was released as a non-label promo-only single. To this day, it has not been made commercially available. In June 1998, she was scheduled to release an album entitled <i>Force of Nature</i>, on which she worked with trip hop musician Tricky. The release of <i>Force of Nature</i> was cancelled due to a disagreement between the two, and only a white label 12\\\" single featuring two dance mixes of \\\"Hurricane\\\" was issued at the time; a slowed-down version of this song became the title track of her comeback album released ten years later while another unreleased track from the album, \\\"Clandestine Affair\\\" (recycling the chorus from her unreleased 1993 track \\\"Volunteer\\\"), appeared on a bootleg 12\\\" in 1004. Jones recorded the track \\\"Storm\\\" in 1998 for the movie <i>The Avengers</i>, and in 1999, appeared in an episode of the <i>Beastmaster</i> television series as the Umpatra Warrior.</p>\\n<p>The same year, Jones recorded \\\"The Perfect Crime\\\", an up-tempo song for Danish TV written by the composer duo Floppy M. aka Jacob Duus and K\\u00e5re Jacobsen. Jones was also ranked 82nd place on VH1's \\\"100 Greatest Women of Rock &amp; Roll\\\". In 2000, Jones collaborated with rapper Lil' Kim, appearing on the song \\\"Revolution\\\" from her album <i>The Notorious K.I.M.</i>. In 2001, Jones starred in the made-for-television film, <i>Wolf Girl</i> (also known as <i>Blood Moon</i>), as an intersexed circus performer named Christoph/Christine. In 2002, Jones joined Luciano Pavarotti on stage for his annual Pavarotti and Friends fundraiser concert to support the United Nations refugee agency's programs for Angolan refugees in Zambia. In November 2004, Jones sang \\\"Slave to the Rhythm\\\" at a tribute concert for record producer Trevor Horn at London's Wembley Arena.</p>\\n<h3>2008\\u2013present: <i>Hurricane</i>, recent endeavours, and <i>Nightclubbing</i> deluxe</h3>\\n<p>Despite several comeback attempts throughout the 1990s, Jones' next full length record was released almost twenty years later, after Jones decided \\\"never to do an album again\\\", changing her mind after meeting music producer Ivor Guest through a mutual friend, milliner Philip Treacy. After the two became acquainted, Guest let Jones listen to a track he had been working on, which became \\\"Devil in My Life\\\", once Jones set the lyrics to the song. The lyrics to the song were written after a party in Venice. The two ended up with 23 tracks. The album included autobiographical songs, such as \\\"This Is\\\", \\\"Williams' Blood\\\" and \\\"I'm Crying (Mother's Tears)\\\", an ode to her mother Marjorie. \\\"Love You to Life\\\" was another track based on real events and \\\"Corporate Cannibal\\\" referred to corporate capitalism. \\\"Well Well Well\\\" was recorded in memory of Alex Sadkin, member of Compass Point All Stars who had died in a motor accident 1987. \\\"Sunset Sunrise\\\" was written by Jones' son, Paulo; the song ponders the relationship between mankind and mother nature. Four songs were removed from the album, \\\"The Key to Funky\\\", \\\"Body Phenomenon\\\", \\\"Sister Sister\\\" and \\\"Misery\\\". For the production of the album, Jones teamed up with Sly and Robbie, Wally Badarou, Barry Reynolds, Mikey Chung, and Uziah \\\"Sticky\\\" Thompson, of the Compass Point All Stars, with contributions from trip-hop artist Tricky, and Brian Eno.</p>\\n<p>The album was released on Wall of Sound on 3 November 2008 in the United Kingdom. PIAS, the umbrella company of Wall of Sound, distributed <i>Hurricane</i> worldwide excluding North America. The album scored 72 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic. Prior to the album's release, Jones performed at Massive Attack's Meltdown festival in London on 19 June 2008, Jones performed four new songs from the album and premiered the music video which Jones and artist Nick Hooker collaborated on, which resulted in \\\"Corporate Cannibal\\\". Jones promoted the album even further by appearing on talk show <i>Friday Night with Jonathan Ross</i>, performed at several awards galas, and embarked on <i>The Hurricane Tour</i>. The same year, Jones was honoured with Q Idol Award. In 2009, Chris Cunningham produced a fashion shoot for <i>Dazed &amp; Confused</i> using Jones as a model to create \\\"Nubian versions\\\" of Rubber Johnny. In an interview for BBC's <i>The Culture Show</i>, it was suggested that the collaboration may expand into a video project. Jones also worked with the avant-garde poet Brigitte Fontaine on a duet named \\\"Soufi\\\" from Fontaine's album <i>Prohibition</i> released in 2009, and produced by Ivor Guest. In March 2010 Jones performed for guests at the 18th annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Viewing Party. The Elton John AIDS Foundation is one of the world's leading nonprofit organisations supporting HIV prevention programs, and works to eliminate the stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS. That evening, US$3.7 million was raised. The same year, a budget DVD version of <i>A One Man Show</i> was released, as <i>Grace Jones \\u2013 Live in Concert</i>. It included three bonus video clips (\\\"Slave to the Rhythm\\\", \\\"Love Is the Drug\\\" and \\\"Crush\\\". 2011 saw Jones again collaborating with Brigitte Fontaine on two tracks from her 2011 release entitled <i>L'un n'emp\\u00eache pas l'autre</i> and performed at the opening ceremony of the 61st FIFA Congress. Jones released a dub version of the album, <i>Hurricane \\u2013 Dub</i>, which came out on 5 September 2011. The dub versions were made by Ivor Guest, with contributions from Adam Green, Frank Byng, Robert Logan and Ben Cowan. In April 2012, Jones joined Deborah Harry, Bebel Gilberto, and Sharon Stone at the Inspiration Gala in S\\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, raising $1.3 Million for amfAR (the Foundation for AIDS Research). Jones closed the evening with a performance of \\\"La Vie en Rose\\\" and \\\"Pull Up to the Bumper.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Two months later, Jones performed at the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, and the Lovebox Festival. On 27 October Jones performed her only North American show of 2012, a performance at New York City's Roseland Ballroom. The same year, Jones presented Sir Tom Jones with not only the GQ Men of the Year award, but her underwear. Tom Jones accepted the gift in good humour, and replied by saying, \\u201dI didn't think you wore any\\\".</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Grace_Jones_@_Fremantle_Park_(17_4_2011)_(5648772822).jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q450429\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":12663653,\"title\":\"Andy Cato\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Andy Cato</b> is an English musician, producer and DJ who is currently one half of the electronic dance band, Groove Armada, the other half being Tom Findlay.

It stretches out across part of the East End of London, England bordering parts of Bethnal Green, Hackney, and Bow, such as along Old Ford Road, London E3 and Victoria Park Road E9. The park is entirely within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The park has two cafes, The Pavilion Cafe in the West and The Park Cafe in the East. There are two playgrounds, one on either side of the park, as well as sporting facilities and a skatepark in the East. The park is home to many historic artifacts and features and has decorative gardens and wilder natural areas as well as open grass lands. Victoria Park is also used as a concert venue and hosts many festivals each year. The park is approximately a mile away from the London Olympic Park. Owing to its proximity to the Olympic park, it became a venue for the BT London Live event along with Hyde Park during the London 2012 Olympic Games. The park has in recent years gone through a 12 million pound refurbishment and many of the park's old features have been reinstated or repaired.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Origins</h2>\\n<p>The Crown Estate purchased 218 acres (88\\u00a0ha) which were laid out by notable London planner and architect Sir James Pennethorne between 1842 and 1846. A part of the area was known as Bonner Fields, after Bishop Bonner, the last lord of the manor of Stepney. The land had originally been parkland, associated with the Bishop's Palace, but by the mid-1800s had been spoiled by the extraction of gravel, and clay for bricks.</p>\\n<p>It was opened to the public in 1845. This large park is reminiscent of Regent's Park (not least because the latter was designed by Pennethorne's teacher John Nash), though much less busy, and is considered by some as the finest park in the East End. It is bounded on two sides by canals: the Regent's Canal lies to the west, while its branch, once known as the Hertford Union Canal runs along the Southern edge of the park. There is a gate named after Edmund Bonner. Guarding the main entrance at Sewardstone Road are replica statues of the Dogs of Alcibiades, the originals of which stood here from 1912 to 2009 until vandalism led to their being removed, restored and rehoused elsewhere in the Park.</p>\\n\\n<p>Two pedestrian alcoves, surviving fragments of the old London Bridge, demolished in 1831, are located at the east end of the park near the Hackney Wick war memorial where they were placed in 1860. They were part of the 1760 refurbishment of the 600 year old bridge, by Sir Robert Taylor and George Dance the Younger, and provided protection for pedestrians on the narrow carriageway. The insignia of the Bridge Association can be seen inside these alcoves. The alcoves have been Grade II listed, since 1951.</p>\\n<p>The Lido opened in 1936 and reopened in 1952 following damage during the Second World War; it was closed in 1986 and demolished in 1990.</p>\\n<h2>The People's Park</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the latter half of the 19th Century, Victoria Park became an essential amenity for the working classes of the East End. For some East End children in the 1880s, this may have been the only large stretch of uninterrupted greenery they ever encountered. Facilities like the Bathing Pond (picture right)\\u00a0\\u2014later superseded by the park lido\\u2014would have introduced many to swimming in an era when many public baths (like that at Shacklewell) were still simply communal washing facilities.</p>\\n<p>Victoria Park's reputation as the 'People's Park' grew as it became a centre for political meetings and rallies of all stripes, perhaps exceeding in importance the more well-known Hyde Park in this regard. The park occupies the interface between Tower Hamlets\\u00a0\\u2014 sunk in poverty in the 19th century and with a strong tradition of socialist and revolutionary agitation\\u00a0\\u2014 and Hackney, more genteel, but heir to a centuries-old legacy of religious dissent and non-conformism that led to its own fierce brand of reformism. So it should come as no surprise that the scene at the numerous Speaker's Corners was a lively one.</p>\\n<p>Although any one could set up their own soapbox, the biggest crowds were usually drawn to 'star' socialist speakers such as William Morris and Annie Besant.</p>\\n\\n<p>This description by J. H. Rosney, correspondent for <i>Harper's Magazine</i> (February 1888) evokes a scene:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<p>On the big central lawn are scattered numerous groups, some of which are very closely packed. Almost all the religious sects of England and all the political and social parties are preaching their ideas and disputing [...]</p>\\n<p>On this lawn the listener, as his fancy prompts him, may assist on Malthusianism, atheism, agnosticism, secularism, Calvinism, socialism, anarchism, Salvationism, Darwinism, and even, in exceptional cases, Swedenborgianism and Mormonism. I once heard there a prophet, a man who professed to be inspired by the Holy Ghost; but this prophet ended by being locked up in an asylum, where he will have to convert the doctor before he can recover his liberty.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The tradition of public speaking in the park continued until well after the Second World War, and was still later reflected in politically oriented rock concerts, such as those held by Rock Against Racism and the Anti-Nazi League in the 1970s and 1980s. And it is still not uncommon for marches or demonstrations to begin or end in Victoria Park.</p>\\n<p>On 26th June 2014, a campaign to revive the Speakers' Corner at Victoria Park was launched at a democratic theatre event held in Shoreditch Town Hall. Hosted by The People Speak, a participatory campaign and events group, 66 audience members deliberated over how to used the pooled cash revenue from their tickets, and eventually voted to recreate the well-known tradition of free speech and debate in Hyde Park in East London's Victoria Park. The campaign is due to formally launch in July 2014.</p>\\n<h2>Second World War</h2>\\n\\n<p>During the Second World War, Victoria Park was largely closed to the public and effectively became one huge Ack-Ack (anti-aircraft) site. The gun emplacements conveniently straddled the path of German Luftwaffe bombers looping north west after attacking the docks and warehouses further south in what is now Tower Hamlets, and so the park was of some strategic importance.</p>\\n<p>More controversially, anti-aircraft activity in the park has been implicated in the crowd panic that caused the Bethnal Green tube disaster of 1943. Some eyewitness accounts have led to the suggestion that, after several air raid alerts, the panic run for shelter was caused by a gigantic explosion of noise from the direction of the park. A BBC documentary on the event suggests that this was due to the first firing of the new Z-Battery anti-aircraft rockets. The UK Ministry of Defence, however, disputes this account.</p>\\n<h2>Modern times</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1986 the Greater London Council transferred responsibility for the park to the London borough of Tower Hamlets and the London Borough of Hackney, through a joint management board. Since 1994 Tower Hamlets has run the park alone.</p>\\n<p>In recent times, Victoria Park became noted for its open-air music festivals, often linked with a political cause. The 1980 rock docudrama <i>Rude Boy</i> features The Clash playing at an Anti-Nazi League event in the park. Radiohead played two concerts in the park on 24\\u201325 June 2008. Madness celebrated their 30th year with a fifth Madstock there on 17 July 2009. The park has also become very popular amongst dance music's biggest names; Dutch DJ Ti\\u00ebsto played at Victoria Park in 2009 and again in 2010. On 24\\u201325 July 2010, Victoria Park was the site of the first High Voltage Festival. Victoria Park has also hosts Field Day, The Apple Cart, Underage Festival and Lovebox Festival.</p>\\n<p>For children, Victoria Park is host to: a <i>One O'Clock Club</i> for under-fives and a programme of summer activities and a children's play park including a paddling pool that runs from 1-5pm in the summer months.</p>\\n<p>The oldest model boat club in the world, the Victoria Model Steam Boat Club, founded in the Park on 15 July 1904, is still active today and holds up to 17 of their Sunday regattas a year. The VMSB Club runs straight-running boats just as they did 100 years ago but have also progressed to radio controlled boats and hydroplanes. The first Regatta is traditionally held on Easter Sunday and the Steam Regatta is always held on the first Sunday in July.</p>\\n<p>The Park is also the home of Tower Hamlets Football Club and Victoria Park United Football club, Victoria Park Harriers &amp; Tower Hamlets Athletics Club, which has its headquarters at St. Augustine's Hall located at the north-east corner of the Park. The Club celebrated its 80th Anniversary in 2006.</p>\\n<p>During the summer cricket is played every evening on the park's three all-weather wickets, organised by the Victoria Park Community Cricket League. The park also has a popular three-lane cricket net, free to use at all times. It was refurbished to a high standard at the end of 2005, paid for by a grant from the England and Wales Cricket Board.</p>\\n<p>The park is open daily from 6:00am to dusk.</p>\\n\\n<p>In 2010 the National Lottery Big Lottery Fund awarded the London Borough of Tower Hamlets a \\u00a34.5\\u00a0million grant towards a \\u00a312\\u00a0million programme of major improvements to Victoria Park. Plans included a new building, the Eastern Hub, comprising a cafe, public toilets, community rooms and adult play facilities to promote healthy living.</p>\\n<p>The landscape has been restored in many places, and the Old English gardens restored to include new water features. In 1842 a pagoda was put in London's Hyde Park as an entrance to its Chinese Exhibit, and when the exhibit finished it was moved to Victoria Park's island in the west boating lake for ornamental purposes. The original architect for the park, Pennethorne, designed a bridge to the island that matched the style of the pagoda; this was never built, however, and during WW2 the pagoda suffered much damage.</p>\\n<p>The pagoda was eventually demolished in the 1950s and all but forgotten, while the water surrounding the island was filled in, shrinking the lake and making what was the island part of the park landscape. With the parks refurbishments that began in 2010 it was decided to restore the island to its former glory; the lake was extended back around the original area, the pagoda was replicated through the use of many photographs and eye-witness information and then, to complete Pennethorne's unfinished vision, the plans for his original bridge were discovered and the bridge built. It took over 100 years, but Pennethorne's vision was finally completed. As a finishing touch, pedallos and row boats were brought back on to the West lake, a feature which had been missing from the park for decades.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Burdett-Coutts fountain (named after Angela Burdett-Coutts the Victorian philanthropist) had a partial restoration of its intricate granite carvings and sculptures. In recent years the fountain had been fenced off due to graffiti and vandalism, but along with the restoration the fences were removed, and four symmetrical mirror pools were placed around the fountain along with decorative flower beds. The area is now a public space, with many benches offering an attractive place to sit.</p>\\n<p>A modern addition to the park is the Memoryscape trail, an audio trail winding through the park that visitors listen to using headphones. The trail consists of many historical facts and tidbits of information, and includes accounts from people who grew up in and around the park, with one person for example reminiscing about the prisoner of war camp in the park during World War 2. Visitors can either download the tracks from the council's website and put them on their own device, or they can get a pair of pre-loaded headphones from the hub in exchange for a small refundable deposit.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<p>London Buses Routes 277, 425 serve the heart of the park, 8, 399, D6, and Night Route N8 on Roman Road. 309 and D3 at London Chest Hospital via Approach Road. 388 (westbound) on Victoria Park Road.</p>\\n<p>Mile End tube station for the Central line, District line, Hammersmith &amp; City line services to Stratford, Upminster, Barking or Central London is 10min via Grove Road, you can take the 277 or 425 to Mile End which is 5min away. Cambridge Heath station for National Rail services to Liverpool Street and Enfield or Chingford is 5mins away via Bishops Way.</p>\\n<p>The Regent's Canal and Hertford Union Canal is located next to the park; this offers to access to walk or cycle on its towpaths. Mare Street or Mile End or Hackney Wick can easily be reached from here. The National Cycle Route 1 (NCR1) passes here on the Hertford Union Canal.</p>\\n<p>The Greenway walk/cycle path to Beckton via Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and Newham General Hospital starts nearby at the far end of the park.</p>\\n<h2>Awards</h2>\\n<p>In summer 2008, the park was voted London's best local park by <i>Time Out</i> magazine. In 2011 it won its first Green Flag award (which it has won every year since,) and it was again voted London's favourite park, this time in the national People's Choice Award. In 2013/14 Victoria Park was also certified a Green Heritage Site by English Heritage and Keep Britain Tidy, an award given in recognition of achieving the required standard in the management and interpretation of a site with local or national historic importance, it retained this award in the following 2014/2015 year.</p>\\n<p>In 2013 the park came second in a national vote to find the public's favourite Green Flag Awarded park, beaten only by Margam Country Park in south Wales from a field of 1,448 qualifying open spaces.</p>\\n<p>In 2014 Victoria Park reinstated itself as the most popular park in the UK with over 13000 votes in the Green Flag Peoples Choice Awards.</p>\\n<h2>In popular culture</h2>\\n<ul><li>Appears in the feature film 'Pride.'

In 1719, <b>the Lower School</b> opened. It has moved many times and the school now has two separate buildings, one for Years 7 and 8, and one for Year 9 and above. From September 2010, due to BSF works the Lower School site will accommodate Years 7 to 8, with Years 9 to 13 remaining at the Upper School. The school has a low rate of A and A* grades at A Level.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Admissions</h2>\\n<p>It is situated in the north of Bethnal Green, just to the east of <i>Cambridge Heath Road</i> (A107) and half a mile south of the Regent's Canal and not far from the Cambridge Heath railway station. It is opposite the London Chest Hospital, just off the Old Ford Road (B118) and in the parish of St James-the-Less, Bethnal Green. It is one of six schools in the borough that has a sixth form.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>Henry Raine had made a good sum of money from selling alcohol. However he was a devout Christian, and he knew that he should use his wealth for good. He decided to found a school where poor children could get a free education. He built it in Wapping, where he lived and named it \\\"the Lower School\\\". It opened in 1719.</p>\\n<p>\\\"The Lower School\\\", was designed to provide an education for fifty boys and fifty girls between the ages of 8 and 18 years. They would learn \\\"the three Rs\\\", which were reading, writing and arithmetic. Girls however were also taught to sew and to cook, and boys were also made to shovel coal underground for the school's heating, and to scrub the floors. This was done in between periods.</p>\\n<h3>Boarding school</h3>\\n<p>In 1736 Henry built and set aside money for a boarding school which would take on forty girls from the Lower School. It was known as \\\"Raine's Hospital\\\" and later \\\"Asylum\\\"(this did not have the connotations it has today). It would have been quite pleasant, with clothes being provided along with frequent meals.</p>\\n<p>The boys and the girls were separated at first and the boys would be beaten if caught talking to a girl. Because of this a fence was put up between the boarding and lower school.</p>\\n<p>In 1820, a new boys' school was opened as there was a large increase in boys at the lower school which was only a boys' school, the girls had the boarding school but were soon to move to the Lower School. It was opened in Silver Street by the Duke of Clarence who was later King William IV.</p>\\n<p>In 1883, the boarding school closed and a new boys' and girls' school opened in Cannon Street Road. Not all places were free anymore, it was 3d a week for the preparatory school and 6d for the senior school.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Former site</h3>\\n<p>In 1913, the school moved to Arbour Square in Stepney, the building still stands today and is part of Tower Hamlets College. It was state of the art with its gymnasium, science laboratories, a girls' cookery room and in World War I a rifle range was built on the open rooftop for boys who could prepare for the army which they would fight in against the Germans. The separation for boys and girls continued until 1964, even the hall was separated by a hinged folding wooden dividing wall.</p>\\n<h3>Comprehensive</h3>\\n<p>In 1977, Raine's merged with St Jude's Secondary School and became a comprehensive school.</p>\\n<p>In 1985, the school moved to Old Bethnal Green Road (the lower school for years 7 and 8), and the old Parmiter's building in Approach Road. Both are in Bethnal Green and remain there until today. The Upper School site is being redeveloped from Summer 2010 as part of the Building Schools for the Future project. This will result in Year 9 being based in the Lower School building.</p>\\n<h2>Motto</h2>\\n<p>The motto was devised when the school opened. It was:</p>\\n<dl><dd><i>\\\"Come in and do your duty to God and man\\\".</i></dd>\\n</dl><p>It has, however, been changed to:</p>\\n<dl><dd><i>\\\"Come in and learn your duty to God and man\\\".</i></dd>\\n</dl><h2>Ethos and events</h2>\\n<p>The general ethos of the school has a friendly feel to it. The social integration of the pupils is good, as is their relationship with the teachers. Events include talent shows held regularly in the school at the end of terms. These are occasions when the pupils can show off talents or skills to their fellow pupils. The most recent was at Summer 2009.</p>\\n<h2>Uniform</h2>\\n<p>When it first opened it had a boys' uniform: cap, long coat with buttons (the neck button always had to be done up), tights and high heel-like shoes.

A new teacher has taken over the lessons.</p>\\n<p>In 2007, some teachers and sixth form students went on a residential trip to China to visit its partner school, and it was an incredibly successful and enjoyable trip for all.</p>\\n<h2>Success story</h2>\\n<p>The school's athletic department is top in P.E.

The Girl's Athletics team have won the borough athletics league for 7 years in a row.</p>\\n<p>Also the Math Challenge with EPGY is run every year with students who excel in Mathematics. It is an annual course in which pupils must sit an entrance exam.</p>\\n<h2>The future</h2>\\n<p>In 2006, the school received \\u00a317 million which will be spent on refurbishing both lower and upper schools which are aging rapidly. At some point in 2008 it is proposed that lower and upper schools will temporarily be merged in order to allow building work to take place at the lower school site with the current building being demolished.

A journeyman player, he has played for fifteen different clubs spanning five countries; England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Greece.</p>\\n<p>Having begun his career with Chelsea, he spent time on loan with Queens Park Rangers, Huddersfield Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion before joining the latter permanently in 2003. Knight spent three years with Brighton, scoring 30 goals in 106 league matches. He was transferred to Swansea City in 2006 and had a loan spell with Barnsley before joining Milton Keynes Dons and then Wycombe Wanderers.</p>\\n<p>Knight signed for Rushden &amp; Diamonds in 2008, but left the club five months later when he was sacked for misconduct. Rushden retained his registration and would not release it to another English club unless they were compensated, which prevented Knight from playing in England for three years. He subsequently played in Greece for Thrasivoulos Fylis, Scotland for Hamilton Academical and Queen of the South and Northern Ireland for Coleraine, before joining Glentoran in January 2012. He was released by Glentoran in June 2012 after a probationary clause in his contract was invoked by the club.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Club career</h2>\\n<p>Knight began his career as a trainee at Chelsea (where he made one appearance in the UEFA Cup against Levski Sofia), before spending loan periods at Queens Park Rangers, Huddersfield Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion before joining Brighton on a permanent contract in August 2003. During his spell at Huddersfield, he reignited the Terriers' play-off push and formed an unlikely partnership with local hero Andy Booth, earning himself the nickname 'Neon Light'. Unfortunately, he was sent off in the penultimate game of the season and was suspended for the play-off games. Although his transfer was initially free, \\u00a350,000 was to be paid if Brighton were promoted. It was Knight himself who secured Brighton's promotion with his penalty against Bristol City in the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff in 2004. Knight had a falling out with Brighton manager Mark McGhee, which culminated in Knight being thrown off the team bus in the middle of the New Forest en route to a match against Southampton on 2 January 2006.</p>\\n<p>Knight moved to Swansea City shortly afterwards, and scored a hat-trick on his debut against Milton Keynes Dons. His stay at the Liberty Stadium was short-lived, and he was placed on the transfer list in October 2006, due to a poor attitude. After a short spell on loan with Barnsley, he joined Milton Keynes Dons in January 2007. In January 2008, Knight signed for Wycombe Wanderers, just one year after joining MK Dons. On 19 August 2008, Knight's contract was \\\"terminated by mutual consent\\\", after he scored five goals in 20 appearances during his short stay with Wycombe.</p>\\n<p>Knight signed for Rushden &amp; Diamonds on a three-year contract on 24 August 2008. but was transfer listed on 29 October, along with Lee Tomlin, Curtis Woodhouse, Andy Burgess, Phil Gulliver, Sagi Burton, Lee Phillips and Dean McDonald, after the club's poor start to the season. On 12 December, Rushden &amp; Diamonds confirmed that Knight had been sacked after continual breaches of conduct between November and December 2008. Despite his contract having been terminated, Rushden &amp; Diamonds retained the players registration, preventing Knight from joining another English club until the term of his contract had expired, unless \\u00a330,000 in compensation was paid to the club. The FA confirmed and validated the retaining of the registration, meaning Knight could not play at any level of English football until the contract had expired. The contract had initially been due to expire following the 2009\\u201310 season, but Rushden &amp; Diamonds invoked a clause allowing them to extend the contract by a further year.</p>\\n<p>On 13 January 2009, Knight joined Greek club Thrasivoulos Filis on a six-month contract. He made his Super League debut on 25 January as a second half sub playing 20 minutes against Skoda Xanthi. Knight made only 2 subsequent appearances as a sub, his last appearance coming on 8 February 2009. Knight had not been involved in any game for the club in over 3 months and looked certain to leave Thrasivoulos when his contract expired at the end of the season. After his contract expired he went on trial with Major League Soccer side San Jose Earthquakes.</p>\\n<p>Knight joined Scottish side Hamilton Academical on 21 August 2009, and he made his SPL debut against Aberdeen as a second half substitute the following day. He made one start and six substitute appearances for the Lanarkshire side. He was sent off for his role in a tunnel brawl after a win over Heart of Midlothian, having been an unused substitute during the game. Knight was later released by Hamilton on 14 January 2010. The next day, Knight joined Dumfries club Queen of the South until the end of the season. He made his debut in a 1\\u20131 draw with Dundee on 23 January. He was released at the end of the 2009\\u201310 season, having made six league appearances for the club. In September 2010, Knight was set to return to English football with Conference side Darlington after a successful trial, but his transfer was blocked by previous club Rushden, who had held onto his registration and demanded \\u00a330,000 for the deal to be completed. Knight responded by criticising Rushden &amp; Diamonds on his Twitter account, saying that he has chosen not to buy-out his contract as a matter of principle. \\\"Rushden have said they don't want the money from Darlington, they want it from me \\u2013 I refuse to pay them out of principle. If I wanted I could raise the money and pay them but I don't want to give them the satisfaction.\\\"</p>\\n<p>The following month, Knight elected to continue his career outside of England by signing for Northern Irish side Coleraine. He scored twice on his debut in a 2\\u20131 win away to Glenavon on 16 October 2010. He agreed an 18-month contract extension with the club in January 2011, and finished the 2010\\u201311 season with 14 league goals from 23 matches. In June, he went on trial with Swindon Town, but was released after two days because of insufficient fitness levels. \\\"He's not the player for us. It's not his fault, we tried, but his fitness at the moment is not good,\\\" said Swindon manager Paolo Di Canio. \\\"We are not in a position where we can wait for a player to be fit, we need a player to be ready and fit in the next two weeks, to compete and challenge during the season.\\\" Two weeks later, Knight was transfer-listed and suspended by Coleraine for failing to appear for training and matches. He also breached club rules by stating his desire to return to England and play for another IFA Premiership club. However, a fortnight later, Knight signed a new two-year contract with the club. \\\"I said things about wanting to leave and at the time I felt it was right for me, but things change,\\\" he said. \\\"I've spoken at great length with the manager over the last three or four days and I came back to him wanting to work something out. Agreeing a new two-year deal shows my commitment to the club and that I'm eager to put the last few weeks behind me.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In January 2012 however, Coleraine asked Knight to either live in Northern Ireland or pay his own travel costs, as he was still living in London and had to travel over to Northern Ireland for each game, which was costing Coleraine \\u00a31,000\\u2013\\u00a31,500 per month. An agreement could not be reached, and Knight joined Glentoran on 30 January 2012. His stay at Glentoran was relatively short lived, as the club released him in June 2012 when they invoked a probationary clause in his contract after he allegedly made homophobic comments on Twitter.</p>\\n<p>On 21 August 2014, Knight sign for North West Countries League, Division One side Barnton AFC. </p>\\n<h2>International career</h2>\\n<p>Knight has played for England at under 19 and under 20 level.</p>\\n<h2>Personal life</h2>\\n<p>Knight was born in Hackney, London, to a Jamaican mother and St. Lucian father, and was educated at Raine's Foundation School, Bethnal Green, He has three sisters, and is the cousin of Bolton Wanderers defender Zat Knight.

The youngest classes follow a Montessori-style education, but the influence of the national curriculum has brought the older classes more into line with mainstream schools. The school admits children from the full ability range, with an emphasis on the Arts, including visits to museums and theatres, as well as sports and outward bound activities.</p>\\n<p>The School was originally founded in Smithfield, London by Phyllis Wallbank, in 1948. It was originally housed in the Gatehouse of St Bartholomew-the-Great church in Smithfield but moved to Bethnal Green in the 1970s. It has been run along Montessori method principles developed by the educationalist Maria Montessori and initially served children from 2 \\u2013 16 years of age, and at the time of its founding, was quite untraditional in its educational philosophy. The school's 60th anniversary in 2008 was marked by a service in the school's original home, St Bartholomew's in Smithfield.</p>\\n<p>The School integrates children with a wide range of disabilities with able-bodied children. It follows the idea that true learning resulted from children exploring the world for themselves through play. It allows children to choose when to take their lessons during the week. A child is required to complete a certain number of lessons in Mathematics, English, Art, Geography etc. per week but would be able to decide when to do them. Students also have free lessons where they can choose any subject they like. The balance of subjects are often weighted towards a child's aptitude or current interests. Different abilities/ages of children are taught in the same session, and their teachers 'sign pupils off' for the lessons they have completed. Some older children (14/15 year olds) can then take the amount of each subject they wished to do over the course of each week, resulting in some pupils spending the week doing 'what they want' e.g., Art/Monday, Geography/Tuesday, English/Wednesday, Biology/Thursday and then back to Art/Friday.</p>\\n<p>After an hour for lunch pupils have an hour to read followed by 'afternoon activities'. These include football, swimming, and visits to museums. The school has also had two ponies, as well as a duck, for the children. It also has an old farm cottage just outside Clochan in Scotland.</p>\\n<p>The Gatehouse School featured in several documentary programmes during the 1970s. Saxophonist &amp; Bon Viveur Brian Hardy taught Art &amp; Dance here. Actors Sophie Ward and Linus Roche were pupils.</p>\\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\\n<ul><li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"The Vocation of Teaching.\\\" <i>The Sower: A Quarterly Magazine on Christian Formation</i>.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Moral Teaching through Shakespeare's Tragedies.\\\" <i>The Sower: A Quarterly Magazine on Christian Formation</i>.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"The Way we Learn.\\\" <i>The Sower: A Quarterly Magazine on Christian Formation</i>.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"The Philosophy of International Education.\\\" <i>Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education</i> 12/2 (2001) 193-209.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Periods of Sensitivity within Human Lives.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 12/3 (2001) 337-384.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Savants.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 13/1 (2002) 137-140.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Time.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 14/1 (2003) 1-12.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Montessori and the New Century.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 14/2 (2003) 135-144.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"A Universal Way of Education.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 15/3 (2004) 521-532.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Adolescence.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 18/1 (2007) 77-90.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Dr Maria Montessori: The Past, the Present and the Future.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 18/2 (2007) 149-158.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"A Montessori Journey: Phyllis Wallbank celebrates the life and work of Dr Montessori.\\\" Montessori International Magazine 83 (2007) 32-33.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Imagination.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 20/1 (2009) 107-108.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"War and Time.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 20/2 (2009) 255-258.</li>\\n<li>Coelho, Ivo.

The union with Hackney was very unpopular with the inhabitants of Stoke Newington, and following unsuccessful attempts to end it in 1864, 1880 and 1890, the parish regained independence in 1894. Stoke Newington Vestry consisted of 60 vestrymen, elected from five wards.</p>\\n<p>South Hornsey formed the southern part of the parish of Hornsey, consisting of the Brownswood Park area south of Finsbury Park, 29 acres (0.1\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) of Clissold Park and two detached areas entirely surrounded by the parish of Stoke Newington. The exclaves of South Hornsey effectively cut off the south-eastern section of Stoke Newington from the rest of the parish. A local board was formed to govern the area in 1867, becoming an urban district under the Local Government Act 1894.</p>\\n<h3>Formation</h3>\\n<p>The London Government Act 1899 provided that the County of London should be divided into metropolitan boroughs. The new authorities were to based on existing parishes with simplified boundaries. It was intended that each borough would have a population of between 100,000 and 400,000 inhabitants. Where an area fell below the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants, it might still be constituted a borough if it had a rateable value exceeding 500,000 pounds.</p>\\n<p>Stoke Newington presented a problem, as its population fell well below the prescribed limits. It was recognised that there were three possibilities: to recombine the parishes of Hackney and Stoke Newington into a single borough; to divide the existing parish of Hackney and combine the wealthier northern section with Stoke Newington to form a municipality with the boundaries of the Hackney North parliamentary constituency; or to add neighbouring areas of Middlesex to increase the population. The first two options were rejected as it was recognised that there was <i>\\\"great ill-feeling and mutual ill-will... between the inhabitants of the two districts\\\"</i>, and it was decided to merge the bulk of South Hornsey, with a population about 20,000, with Stoke Newington. While this still created a borough of only about 50,000 inhabitants, and thus <i>\\\"the smallest borough in London, the anomaly would be a gradually diminishing one, because the population in this district was rapidly increasing. When dividing London up into boroughs they could not avoid creating some anomalies as to size.\\\"</i></p>\\n<h3>Boundaries</h3>\\n<p>Under the 1899 legislation, boundary commissioners were appointed to set the boundaries of the new boroughs. The existing parish boundaries frequently divided houses or related to field boundaries that had disappeared with the urbanisation of the area. The commissioners realigned the boundary lines so that for the most part they ran down the centre of roads, railways or watercourses.</p>\\n<p>To the north, the borough had a boundary with Middlesex, marked by the course of the New River and the Seven Sisters Road. Stoke Newington's boundaries with the two neighbouring metropolitan boroughs within the County of London were as follows:</p>\\n<ul><li>Islington to the west and south: the centres of Blackstock Road, Mountgrove Roads, Green Lanes, (diverting to take in Petherton Road and Leconfield Road) Matthias Road and Boleyn Road.</li>\\n<li>Hackney to the east and north east: the centre of the ancient Ermine Street, known here as Kingsland High Street, Stoke Newington Road and Stoke Newington High Street, then following the North London Railway from Stoke Newington railway station to Bethune Road. (The area to the east of the main road, including Stoke Newington Common, never formed part of Stoke Newington administratively, lying within the parish of Hackney).</li>\\n</ul><h2>Coat of arms</h2>\\n\\n<p>The long association with the dean and chapter of St Paul's Cathedral is represented by the red background and crossed swords. The cross is from the arms of William Patten, first lord of the manor and rebuilder of the church of St Mary, in 1550. The trees represent the ancient forest, and the green lion, that of John Dudley. The griffin refers to Daniel Defoe, and the banner, the arms of Sir Thomas Abney.</p>\\n<p>The Latin motto translates as <i>Look to the past and the future</i>, the arms were granted on 12 June 1934.</p>\\n<p>When merged to found the London Borough of Hackney in 1965, oaks from these arms were put in the new coat of arms of the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>The coat of arms of 1934 replaced an unofficial device adopted by the council on incorporation in 1900. At the top of the shield was a representation of the parish church. The lower part of the shield featured the arms of the cities of London and Westminster on the left, and the attributed arms of the Kingdom of Essex representing Middlesex on the right. These armorial devices were chosen to represent the union of Stoke Newington in the County of London and South Hornsey in Middlesex. The crest was formed by a tree, recalling Stoke Newington's origin as a village in the Middlesex Forest.<br clear=\\\"all\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Area and population</h2>\\n<h3>Predecessor authorities</h3>\\n<p>Statistics compiled by the London County Council, in 1901 show the population growth in London, over the preceding century. The figures compiled by the council for 1891 do not agree with those that appear in the census reports, however which gave a population of 47,988 for the area.</p>\\n<p><b>Stoke Newington St Mary's with South Hornsey 1801-1900</b></p>\\n<h3>Metropolitan borough</h3>\\n<p>The area of the parish of Stoke Newington was 639 acres (2.6\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) in 1891. Following the addition of most of South Hornsey and the boundary adjustments with Hackney and Islington, the area of the borough in 1901 was 863 acres (3.5\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>). The populations recorded in National Censuses were:</p>\\n<p><b>Metropolitan Borough 1900-1961</b></p>\\n<h2>Politics</h2>\\n\\n<h3>Borough council</h3>\\n<p>The borough council consisted of 30 councillors and 5 aldermen. In 1900 the boundary commissioners divided the borough into six wards for the election of councillors:<br></p>\\n<p>The first council elected consisted entirely of \\\"Non-Party\\\" candidates, although <i>The Times</i> noted that they were \\\"Conservative in character\\\". The entire council continued to be described as Independent or Non-Party until the 1934 election when the Labour Party gained 13 seats to the Independents' 17. Labour gained control of the council in 1945, taking all of the seats on the council. The Conservative Party first ran in the 1949 election, winning control from Labour by 23 seats to 7.</p>\\n<p>The wards of the borough were redrawn in 1953, with the area divided into ten wards, each electing three councillors. This reflected the change in settlement in the area, in particular the construction of new estates of council flats, including the London County Council's large Woodberry Down development which housed about a seventh of the borough's population. The names of the wards, a number of which were named after famous residents of Stoke Newington, were as follows:</p>\\n<p>Labour regained power at the 1953 election with 24 seats to 6 Conservatives. They held control at subsequent elections, taking all the seats in 1959. The final election of the council on 10 May 1962 saw four Liberal Party councillors elected to form an opposition group to the 26 Labour members.</p>\\n<h3>Parliamentary constituency</h3>\\n<p>Until 1918 the area formed part of the constituency of Hackney North. In 1918 a new constituency of Stoke Newington identical with the metropolitan borough was created. Due to loss of population, the two constituencies were merged in 1950 as Hackney North and Stoke Newington.</p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>London Government Act 1899</li>\\n<li>Metropolis Management Act 1855</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n\\n<h2><cite>Further reading</cite></h2>\\n<ul><li><cite>Robert Donald, ed.

Among the well-known artists who made their early recordings with producer Nick Lowe at Pathway Studios are The Damned, Madness, Elvis Costello, The Police, Squeeze, Haircut One Hundred, The Count Bishops with Mike Spenser, The Cannibals and John Foxx. At the studio, Dire Straits recorded the demo and single versions of \\\"Sultans of Swing\\\", and the folk singer Ewan MacColl recorded his last album. The 8-track studio, a former garage, was famous for its great atmosphere, cold temperatures, distinctive smell and excellent recordings.</p>\\n<p>Mike Finesilver had been a member of the Crazy World of Arthur Brown and played on its major UK #1 hit \\\"Fire\\\" released on Track Records in 1968.</p>\\n<p>Pathway can be regarded as the 'delivery room' at the birth of British punk - it was here that The Damned recorded their debut single 'New Rose' in September 1976, again produced by Lowe. In addition, it also featured extensively in the Madness drama-documentary Take It or Leave It.</p>\\n<p>Tim Crowther described it thus:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<p>\\\"The studio was very small, about 8 x 8 metres with a 2 x 2m control booth in the corner and an upright piano next to it. You could just squeeze three people into the control booth! The tape deck was a Brenell 1\\u00a0inch 8 track. The monitors and desk were custom made, and they had a pair of Auratones as well, fed from Quad power amps. The desk was quite small, pushed hard against the front wall with the custom monitors hung above and the Auratones on the meter bridge. Outboard was very basic: a Bel delay line, an Alesis digital reverb and Drawmer gates, but they had a nice plate reverb in a cupboard in the office upstairs. I can't recall all the mics but they were the industry standard stuff. We got big warm sounding mixes and despite the cramped conditions the mixing process seemed effortless compared to the difficult digital learning curve I have been on in the last two years.\\\"</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Notable recordings</h2>\\n<h3>Individual Tracks</h3>\\n<ul><li>Dire Straits: Sultans of Swing (demo) (1977)</li>\\n<li>The Police: Fall Out (1977)</li>\\n<li>The Flys: Love and a Molotov Cocktail (1977)</li>\\n<li>Madness:The Prince (1979)</li>\\n<li>Ewan MacColl: Dirty Old Town (1983)</li>\\n</ul><h3>Albums</h3>\\n<ul><li>Elvis Costello\\u00a0:My Aim Is True (1976)</li>\\n<li>The Damned: Damned Damned Damned (1977)</li>\\n<li>Nick Lowe: Jesus of Cool (1978)</li>\\n<li>Squeeze: Squeeze (1978)</li>\\n<li>John Foxx: Metamatic (1980)</li>\\n</ul><h3>Film</h3>\\n<ul><li>Madness: Take It or Leave It</li>\\n</ul><h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Early recordings by Madness</li>\\n<li>More information and photos</li>\\n<li>Photographs of Squeeze recording there in 1976</li>\\n</ul>\",\"image\":\"\",\"people\":[{\"pageid\":885003,\"title\":\"Larry Wallis\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Larry Wallis</b> (born 19 May 1949) is an English guitarist, songwriter and producer.

The band split up in late 1969 at the same time as the Pink Fairies <i>Mark 1</i> line-up of Steve Peregrin Took, Mick Farren and Twink (with girlfriend Silver Darling) parted company.</p>\\n<h2>Shagrat</h2>\\n<p>Twink formed Pink Fairies <i>Mark 2</i> with Farren's former band The Deviants leaving Farren bandless. The original intent was for Farren and Took to form Shagrat with ex-Entire Sioux Nation members Tim Taylor and Larry Wallis. Very soon though, Farren left after having a falling-out with Took. Shagrat thus became Took's band outright. Took, Wallis and Taylor were joined by drummer Phil Lenoir, formerly of Black Cat Bones. This lineup recorded three tracks at Strawberry Studios in Stockport played one gig at the Phun City Festival in July 1970 before Taylor and Lenoir left. Took and Wallis carried on with drummer Dave Bidwell and in early 1971 the trio recorded four acoustic Took songs. All seven tracks were released in the early 1990s on limited edition vinyl and were later compiled together on the CD <i>Lone Star</i> in 2001 by Japanese label Captain Trip Records.</p>\\n<h2>Blodwyn Pig, Took and UFO</h2>\\n<p>Wallis then joined Blodwyn Pig, which changed its name to <i>Lancaster's Bombers</i> (later shortened to <i>Lancaster</i>) with Jack Lancaster. They were a short-lived band although they toured supporting Yes in 1971.</p>\\n<p>In February 1972, Wallis joined UFO, but left in October 1972, after a tour by Europe. Wallis did not record with the band, although a bootlegged live recording of a UFO performance featuring Wallis is known to exist.</p>\\n<p>Sometime during 1972 Wallis recorded sessions with Steve Peregrin Took at Took\\u2019s basement flat in Mayfair. These very casual sessions contain appearances by Twink, Mick Wayne, Duncan Sanderson, and almost certainly Syd Barrett. Material from these sessions was released in 1995 as <i>The Missing Link To Tyrannosaurus Rex</i>, a posthumous Took solo album on Cleopatra Records</p>\\n<h2>The Pink Fairies</h2>\\n<p>In November 1972, Wallis joined the Pink Fairies, substituting for Mick Wayne. The band released an album <i>Kings of Oblivion</i> which contained mostly Wallis-penned tracks. The band played with an extended line-up for a special gig in July 1975. Several years later, in 1982, their only live performance was released as <i>Live at the Roundhouse 1975</i>. In 1991, it was reissued under the name <i>At the Roundhouse/Previously Unreleased</i>, comprising the original live album, plus additional songs by Larry Wallis from 1984, and an EP by Twink from 1977.</p>\\n<h2>Mot\\u00f6rhead</h2>\\n<p>While still a member of the Pink Fairies, in May 1975 Wallis joined a new band called Mot\\u00f6rhead with Lemmy and Lucas Fox. In September 1975 Fox left the band and Mot\\u00f6rhead recruited a new drummer, Phil \\\"Philthy Animal\\\" Taylor. Wallis recorded an album with the band, <i>On Parole</i>. It remained unreleased until 1979 when Mot\\u00f6rhead had established some reputation for themselves. In February 1976 Wallis was joined by \\\"Fast\\\" Eddie Clarke on guitar. Later in the same month Wallis left Mot\\u00f6rhead. Wallis remained with Pink Fairies, which continued as a trio, until July 1976 when they gained additional guitarist, Martin Stone. In September 1976 the band released a single, \\\"Between The Lines\\\"/\\\"Spoiling For A Fight\\\" on Stiff Records. Four months later in January 1977 the band split up. In the same month Wallis guested at a one-off gig with members of Thin Lizzy and Rat Scabies of The Damned.</p>\\n<h2>Steve Took</h2>\\n<p>During 1975 and 1976 Wallis did further recording work with Took although none of these sessions have been released to date. Wallis was present, by chance, at Pathway Studios on 29 November 1977 when Steve Took's Horns recorded material which would eventually be released in 2004.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q1385386\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":16068439,\"title\":\"Shaun Lawton\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Shaun Lawton</b> (born <b>Sydney Shaun Lawton</b>; 1941) is an English playwright, poet, actor and singer/songwriter.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q3481573\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":0}],\"lon\":-0.091,\"wikidata\":\"Q7144880\",\"lat\":51.549,\"pageid\":13700778,\"ns\":0,\"type\":null},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":2152,\"title\":\"York Hall\",\"extract\":\"<p>The <b>York Hall</b> is a health and leisure centre and one of Britain's best known boxing venues.</p>\\n<p>The venue is situated on Old Ford Road in Bethnal Green, London, England.

This popular and often full facility was closed and re-branded as and upmarket \\\"Spa London\\\" by the council in July 2007, amid vocal protests from its users.

He won his next six fights in a row before stepping up to fight fellow prospect John Fewkes (13-0) at the Leeds Town Hall. The fight gave Watson his first pro defeat as Fewkes scored a points victory over 8 rounds. Following that first loss Watson regrouped and scored wins over Robert Lloyd-Taylor (twice) and fellow prospect Michael Lomax. The victories set him up for a shot at the Commonwealth Welterweight title held by tough Namibian Ali Nuumbembe in a fight to be held on 8 December 2007 at the Robin Park Centre in Wigan.</p>\\n<h3>Commonwealth welterweight champion</h3>\\n<p>Watson produced the performance of his career so far in Wigan, beating Nuumbembe to win the Commonwealth title when the fight was stopped in the 8th round. An early clash of heads had caused a cut above Nuumbembe's left eye which eventually got so bad that the corner could not stem the flow of blood and so handed Watson victory. The newly crowned champion then travelled to Italy for his next fight in order to contest the vacant European Union belt against unbeaten Italian Daniele Petrucci. The fight on 8 March 2008 ended in bitter disappointment for Watson when the referee stopped it in the 3rd round with Watson saying that he was neither \\\"mentally or physically prepared\\\" for the fight having taken the match at short notice.</p>\\n<p>Redemption came only a few months later on 24 May 2008 when Watson found himself sharing a ring with Matthew Hatton at the City of Manchester Stadium.

Watson ended up winning the fight on points over 12 rounds prompting Hatton to say afterwards that Watson was the first man who had legitimately beaten him in the ring. On 11 April 2009 Watson lost the title in his second defence to John O'Donnell in a close fought contest at the York Hall to register the third defeat of his career.

On 12 December 2004, following a string of seven wins over opponents including Jeff Thomas, Ernie Smith and Daniel Thorpe he was matched against fellow unbeaten prospect Colin Bain. The fight, at the Marriott Hotel in Glasgow, resulted in a first career defeat for Bain as Burns won over the six round distance. For Burns, the win set him up for a journey south of the border to face the unbeaten British lightweight champion Graham Earl in a non-title fight. The fight with Earl took place at the Wembley Conference Center and Burns produced one of the upsets of the year when he scored a points victory to beat Earl over eight rounds.</p>\\n<h3>Title fights</h3>\\n<p>The win against Earl meant he would land a shot at the big time when in February 2006, he took on reigning British, Commonwealth and European champion Alex Arthur. The fight took place in Edinburgh and ended in defeat for Burns, as Arthur retained on points. Burns who was still only a 12-fight novice at this stage took the fight to Arthur prompting the champion to heap praise on him; \\\"Ricky Burns was in superb shape and he was up for the fight\\\" said Arthur, \\\"He's a brilliant boxer with a great future and he could be a world champion one day.\\\" Burns himself refused to be disappointed with the loss saying; \\\"I don't count that as a loss. I'm just 22 and it was great experience for me\\\".</p>\\n<p>Burns next had a crack at the British title almost exactly a year later when in February 2007, he met reigning champion Carl Johanneson at the Town Hall in Leeds. The fight ended once again in defeat with Burns losing a 12 round decision to the experienced champion. Johanneson intent on winning well before his home crowd hounded Burns throughout the fight and managed to knock Burns down three times.</p>\\n<h3>New challenges</h3>\\n<p>After the defeat to Johanneson, Burns took the decision to leave his old boxing club in a bid to seek a new challenge. Burns had worked with Rab Bannan at the Barn Boxing Club for over 14 years, but the Johanneson defeat prompted a need for a change of direction. On telling his former mentor the news Burns said; \\\"It was a nightmare having to tell him. It was really sad because I\\u2019ve been with him for 14 years. All my boxing life really. It was really hard but we left on good terms and we shook hands and I\\u2019m sure our paths will cross again.\\\" Burns moved to the Dalmarnock gym in Glasgow, where he could train alongside the likes of Willie Limond and Kenny Anderson.</p>\\n<p>Since the fight with Johanneson, Burns won eight fights in a row. A ten round win over Romanian Gheorghe Ghiompirica at the Thistle Hotel in Glasgow gave him the lightly regarded British International Masters belt. Burns also spent time sparring former opponent Alex Arthur in preparation for Arthur's WBO Super-Featherweight title defence against Nicky Cook.</p>\\n<h3>Commonwealth champion</h3>\\n<p>In September 2008, Burns was in line for a crack at the vacant Commonwealth title, a belt which had been given up by Londoner Kevin Mitchell. The challenge took place at the York Hall in Bethnal Green and saw Burns outpoint the Ghanaian Osumana Akaba over 12 rounds. The fight which was taken with only weeks notice after the original main event on the card was cancelled propelled Burns into the championship frame. Speaking of his future ambitions Burns said; \\\"There is only one fight I want at the moment. That fight would be the current British champion Kevin Mitchell. He recently has been injured, and won't be back until December so we'll have to see what happens\\\".</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/RickyBurns2013.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q1890332\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":19091459,\"title\":\"John Murray (boxer)\",\"text\":\"<p><b>John Murray</b> (born 20 December 1984, Manchester, England) is an English lightweight boxer.

Over the next two years Murray was busy in the ring scoring 15 more wins in 15 fights before in December 2005 defeating Ignacio Mendoza for the WBC World Youth lightweight title. He made one defence of his title against Moebi Sarouna and scored decent wins over Ben Odamattey and Lorenzo Bethea before defeating Dean Hickman at the Ice Arena in Nottingham for the English title. In October 2006 he was awarded the prestigious young boxer of the year award at a ceremony held in London, an award previously held by the likes of Ricky Hatton, Frank Bruno and Barry McGuigan.</p>\\n<h3>British Champion</h3>\\n<p>Following the Hickman victory, Murray fought twice more against journeyman opponents before meeting Salford boxer Lee Meager for the vacant British lightweight title in July 2008. He won the belt after the referee stopped the fight in the 5th round. Following the fight Meager, a promotional stablemate, announced his retirement. The first defence of his title was made on 17 January 2009 at the Robin Park Centre in Wigan. Murray managed to keep hold of the belt after scoring an 8th round stoppage over Aberdeen's Lee McAllister.</p>\\n<p>Murray's second defence of the title on 13 June 2009 against Stoke fighter Scott Lawton ended before it had even begun when Murray weighed in for the contest 2oz overweight. Despite efforts to get down to the lightweight limit, Murray was unable to shift the weight and was stripped of the belt. The contest with Lawton still went ahead and resulted in a sixth round stoppage for Murray ensuring that he was still undefeated but no longer a champion. As punishment for failing to make the weight in a championship contest Murray, his trainer Joe Gallagher and his manager Mike Marsden were each fined \\u00a31500 by the British Boxing Board of Control.</p>\\n<p>Murray reclaimed the belt on 3 October 2009 after scoring a fourth round stoppage against former British and European champion Jonathon Thaxton at the Altrincham Leisure Centre. He had his fourth official British title fight on 7 May 2010 against Welsh boxer Gary Buckland this time in Widnes. The fight was also for the vacant European title and resulted in an 11th round stoppage win for Murray who was also able to keep his Lonsdale Belt for good. Murray having won the belt outright chose to vacate in order to defend his European crown with Gavin Rees winning the vacant title against John Watson on 6 November 2010.</p>\\n<h3>European Champion</h3>\\n<p>Murray made the first defence of the European title on 25 September 2010 against the Ukrainian boxer Andriy Kudryavtsev at the Robin Park Arena in Wigan. Kudryavstev had previously fought for the title in 2009 losing to Anthony Mezaache in 12 rounds and had held a number of titles including the Ukrainian national title and the European External Union title. Murray wore down his opponent to score a 9th round stoppage after a high tempo contest. Speaking after the fight Murray said that he knew the fight would be tough after watching Kudryavstev on tape and said that now he wanted to fight the top guys in the lightweight division saying he'd love a <i>\\\"world title shot before Christmas\\\"</i>. Murray's next fight however was to be on 2 April 2011, traveling to London's York Hall to defend against Spanish champion Karim El Ouazghari. Both fighters were warned and deducted a point during the fight which Murray eventually won on points over the 12 round distance. The fight against El Ouazghari was Murray's first since joining up with promoter Frank Warren and was described by some as a \\\"scrappy\\\" performance. Murray summed up by saying \\\"It wasn't my best fight, it was like having my debut again. I have cleaned up at domestic and European level and I am looking at moving on\\\". Warren himself said that he'd like to see a fight between Murray and Kevin Mitchell in the future saying \\\"the fans would like to see, but the bottom line is that John is the champion and it's all about what he wants to do.\\\"</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/John_Murrayboxer.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q14248464\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":36021798,\"title\":\"Frank Buglioni\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Frank 'The Wise Guy' Buglioni</b> (born 18 April 1989) is a British super-middleweight professional boxer from England and former holder of the WBO European Super Middleweight belt.

In the early 1990s, Ayass ventured into the world of tape trading after seeing an advert in <i>Superstars of Wrestling</i> magazine (later <i>Power Slam</i>). Through his tape trading, Ayass made contact with wrestlers and trainee wrestlers, including Robbie Brookside and Alex Shane. It was Shane who got him into the business, when in the summer of 1993, he asked Ayass to join him at a trial training session at Andre Baker's Hammerlock School of Wrestling in Folkestone. Although Ayass decided that physical wrestling was not for him, he stayed in touch with Shane and Baker, and when Hammerlock started to promote shows locally to give trainees experience, they contacted Ayass and asked him to take on the role of ring announcer. Ayass acted as Hammerlock's ring announcer from 1993 until 1998, when he decided to leave the wrestling business.</p>\\n<h3>FWA</h3>\\n<p>Ayass travelled with friends to an FWA (Frontier Wrestling Alliance) show in Portsmouth, called No Surprises 3.

Ayass joined the FWA officially on 10 November 2001, at FWA Back to School, when he jumped the guard rail after sitting in the audience and offered his managerial services to Justin Richards, whom he had known from their Hammerlock days. By the end of the night, both Ayass and Richards had joined the Old School faction.</p>\\n<p>Ayass continued to work as a manager in the FWA until 2006, when the promotion moved its base north to Morecambe, where Ayass's use was discontinued for what the FWA described as \\\"geographical reasons\\\".

The main stars of this faction were Flash Barker, who won the FWA British Heavyweight Championship at this time, Drew McDonald, Dino Scarlo, Robbie Brookside, Richards, Mark Sloan and Karl Kramer.</p>\\n<p>Ayass was also a regular presenter on TalkSPORT radio station's <i>Talk Wrestling</i> show on a Saturday night, along with Shane and Simon Lilsboy. During this time, Ayass issued an on-air challenge to Jody Fleisch for the forthcoming No Surprises 4 show in Portsmouth on 28 July 2002. Ayass said that if Fleisch could get to the venue before the final bell, then he could have a title shot against Barker, knowing full well that Fleisch would be travelling back from Japan at the time, where he was touring with Michinoku Pro Wrestling. Barker defeated \\\"Solid Gold\\\" Scott Parker at that show, and as the final bell sounded, Fleisch appeared and had an impromptu match, which Fleish won.

Ayass, suffering badly from flu at the time, was barred from ringside to minimise his involvement in the show, and Fleisch won the title officially this time.

He is mostly known for his work as <b>The Great Muta</b> in New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) during the 1990s, but he has also worked in United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Taiwan. He is a former owner and president of All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), as well as being a full-time wrestler for the promotion from 2002 to 2013. He also gained the rank of the Master Sergeant during his military service in Japan.</p>\\n<p>Mutoh is credited as one of the first Japanese wrestlers to achieve a fan base outside of his native Japan in the United States. The Great Muta gimmick is one of the most influential gimmicks in puroresu, having been emulated by many wrestlers including Satoshi Kojima (as The Great Koji), Kazushi Miyamoto (as The Great Kazushi), Atsushi Onita (as The Great Nita), and Seiya Sanada (as The Great Sanada). In addition, countless independent wrestlers have paid tribute to Muta through emulation and imitation.</p>\\n<p>Mutoh is one of three wrestlers to hold the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, the AJPW Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, and the IWGP Heavyweight Championship (the others being Shinya Hashimoto and Satoshi Kojima). He is a nine-time world champion, having held the NWA world title once, the IWGP title four times, AJPW's Triple Crown three times and Wrestle-1's World title one time. He also has held a dozen World Tag Team Championships in the U.S. and Japan. Between NJPW, AJPW, and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Mutoh has held 22 total championships.</p>\\n<p>He is also famous for taking part in what is generally considered to be the bloodiest professional wrestling match of all time against Hiroshi Hase, leading to the creation of the \\\"Muta Scale\\\".</p>\\n<p>Mutoh is currently the owner/founder of Wrestle-1 (W-1), where he also wrestles semi-regularly, and makes occasional special appearances for American promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as part of a TNA/W-1 talent exchange partnership. He is also currently the Wrestle-1 Champion in his first reign, making him the only wrestler to be World Champion in NJPW, AJPW, and W-1.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Career</h2>\\n<h3>Early career (1984\\u20131987)</h3>\\n<p>Mutoh was an amateur wrestler and competed in numerous Judo competitions prior to being trained by Hiro Matsuda in the New Japan Pro Wrestling Academy. He debuted on October 5, 1984 against Masahiro Chono. In 1986, Mutoh was sent on his first learning excursion to the United States for seasoning. Muta wrestled in Florida as the White Ninja and teaming with Kendo Nagasaki, before returning to New Japan in 1986, when he was nicknamed \\\"Space Lone Wolf\\\", a space-age type character that was briefly revived in 2005 by NOSAWA Rongai. In March 1987, Mutoh won the IWGP Tag Team Championship with Shiro Koshinaka, before losing the titles to Akira Maeda and Nobuhiko Takada six days later. In the summer of 1987, Mutoh took part in the NOW vs. NEW feud, in which he aligned himself with Antonio Inoki and his group, teaming with the likes of Inoki, Seiji Sakaguchi, Yoshiaki Fujiwara, and Kantaro Hoshino, battling the likes of Tatsumi Fujinami, Riki Choshu, Maeda, Kengo Kimura, and Super Strong Machine.</p>\\n<h3>World Wrestling Council and World Class Championship Wrestling (1988\\u20131989)</h3>\\n<p>In January 1988, Mutoh went on another excursion, this time in Puerto Rico for the World Wrestling Council under his new ring name, The Super Black Ninja. He feuded with Miguel Perez, Jr., with whom he lost a hair vs. hair match to that April. It was in Puerto Rico he formed The Three Musketeers with Chono and Shinya Hashimoto. He wrestled only one match in New Japan on July 29, before returning to Puerto Rico. In the fall of 1988, Mutoh moved to the Dallas, Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling, where he reunited with Kendo Nagasaki and had a very short lived feud with Kevin Von Erich before departing the organization in March 1989. Mutoh's personality and ring skills earned him a high billing in the National Wrestling Alliance, where he was dubbed <b>The Great Muta</b>.</p>\\n<h3>National Wrestling Alliance (1989\\u20131990)</h3>\\n<p>Muta first appeared, as Great Mota, in the NWA on the March 18, 1989 edition of World Championship Wrestling. His manager Gary Hart introduced him as the son of the Great Kabuki, whom Gary Hart also had managed years earlier. He wrestled his first match under the new persona on April 2 against Scott Casey. Muta would feud with stars like Lex Luger, Ric Flair, and especially Sting, from whom he would capture the NWA World Television Championship on September 3, 1989. He eventually lost the championship to Arn Anderson on January 2, 1990 (aired on the January 12, 1990 edition of NWA Power Hour), and some time after the Clash of the Champions on February 6, Mutoh eventually returned to New Japan, going between his real name and his Muta gimmick as he pleased.</p>\\n<h3>New Japan Pro Wrestling (1990\\u20132009, 2012, 2013, 2014)</h3>\\n<p>Mutoh quickly rose in rank since returning to New Japan in March 1990. He would debut his Great Muta persona six months later. In April 1990, he won his second IWGP Tag Team title with Masahiro Chono, defeating Shinya Hashimoto and Masa Saito. He and Chono would hold the titles for over six months, before finally losing them to Hiroshi Hase and Kensuke Sasaki. In 1991, Mutoh and Chono, along with Hashimoto, cemented their status as the next generation of New Japan, surpassing Antonio Inoki, Tatsumi Fujinami, and Riki Ch\\u014dsh\\u016b, after the finals of the first G1 Climax tournament. In an epic thirty-minute match, Mutoh was bested by Chono and, together with Hashimoto, the three celebrated in the ring, then afterwards they were labeled the <i>Three Musketeers</i> of New Japan Pro Wrestling.</p>\\n<p>1992 saw Chono repeat his success in the G1 Climax (winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the process); just four days later, Mutoh, donning his Muta persona, beat Japanese legend Riki Ch\\u014dsh\\u016b for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, marking his first reign. On December 14, Muta faced Hiroshi Hase in a famous match where Hase used a foreign object to beat at Muta's forehead, as payback for their previous encounters, including the September 14, 1990 encounter, in which Muta busted Hase open. Muta bladed and cut very deeply into his forehead. As a result of this, Muta bled profusely for the rest of the match, and to this day he still bears scars from where he sliced.</p>\\n<p>For a short time in 1993, after beating Chono in a title versus title match at Fantastic Story in Tokyo Dome (known in North America as WCW/New Japan Supershow III), Mutoh held both the NWA and IWGP championships at the same time (being one of only two men ever to do so along with Tatsumi Fujinami); the unification was short-lived, as Barry Windham beat him a month later for the NWA World title at SuperBrawl III. As IWGP champion, Mutoh had a variety of challengers in title matches and exhibitions, including Hulk Hogan, Sting, The Great Kabuki, and his fellow members of the Three Musketeers, Chono and Hashimoto, before finally losing the title on September 20, 1993 to Hashimoto. Following this title loss and a match with Hogan against the Hellraisers (the team of Hawk Warrior and Kensuke Sasaki as Power Warrior), Mutoh returned to fighting primarily under his real name, reviving the Muta name for certain matches, such as a special match with Antonio during his retirement countdown. During this time, Mutoh created a team with Hiroshi Hase, working their way up the ranks against the likes of the Steiner Brothers to challenge the Hellraisers in November 1994 and capturing the IWGP Tag Team championship\\u2014his third tag title.</p>\\n<p>On April 17th, 1994 Mutoh returned to WCW to face Stunning Steve Austin at Spring Stampede for the U.S. Championship.</p>\\n<p>While having the Tag Team title around his waist was fine, Mutoh had further ambitions: beating the man who took his title, Shinya Hashimoto; by now the IWGP champion for nearly a year. His second title reign came on May 3, 1995\\u2014a year and two days after Hashimoto won the championship from Fujinami. After winning the IWGP title, Mutoh and Hase vacated the Tag Team titles so Mutoh could focus on his Heavyweight title. Afterwards, Mutoh went on to win the 1995 G1 Climax, beating Hashimoto in the finals to become the first of two men to win the G1 as IWGP Heavyweight Champion (Kensuke Sasaki would achieve this feat in 2000). Mutoh held the IWGP title throughout the rest of the year, leading New Japan in the opening battles of the feud with Nobuhiko Takada and the UWF-i army before losing his title to Takada on January 4, 1996 at the Tokyo Dome. The latter half of 1996 had Mutoh pitted against Chono's Ookami Gundan\\u2014or Wolf Army, which eventually blossomed into a war with the Chono-led nWo Japan. In the process, Mutoh began teasing at a possible turn to the side of the nWo, proclaiming himself to be the true successor to Antonio Inoki's legacy, and \\\"accidentally\\\" attacking his own partners in the middle of a match.</p>\\n<p>During this period, Mutoh underwent a long slump in big matches, losing not only to members of the nWo, but fellow New Japan wrestlers such as Hashimoto; and many times the turn was teased. Mutoh would even wear an nWo shirt only to proclaim days later that he refuses to join Chono's army. Mutoh further raised confusion by playing both sides of the feud; fighting as a member of New Japan under his real name, and as The Great Muta in nWo Japan, before being The Great Muta full-time for several months in 1997. The full turn came in September 1997, when Mutoh, after teasing a turn on his nWo teammates, double-crossed Sasaki and Kazuo Yamazaki, sealing away the Muta name and formally joining nWo Japan as himself. Almost immediately following this, he and Chono dominated the tag team scene in NJPW, defeating Yamazaki and Sasaki for their second IWGP tag title reign as a duo, and spray-painting the plates of the belts black as a show of disrespect for the championship's legacy.</p>\\n<p>They eventually would be forced to vacate the title in May 1998, when Mutoh injured his knees, as his years of using the moonsault press were finally catching up to him. During this time, he took a hiatus from action, returning just before the 1998 G1 Climax (from which he was eliminated by Genichiro Tenryu in the first round). Despite his return, Mutoh was plagued by this nagging injury, fighting through his pain throughout the rest of 1998 and all of 1999; even winning his third IWGP Heavyweight title from one of Chono's right-hand men, Scott Norton. Towards the end of 1998, Mutoh took the leadership of nWo Japan, after Chono suffered a neck injury and was out of action, turning the nWo into a face stable, which Chono didn't like. Mutoh feuded with Chono for the name of the nWo, which evolved into a war between the nWo, led by Mutoh, Hiroyoshi Tenzan, and Satoshi Kojima and Chono's new <i>Team 2000</i> unit, with himself, Don Frye, Super J, and others from the old generation of the nWo. On December 10, 1999, Mutoh lost the IWGP Championship to Tenryu. The war between Chono and Mutoh was lost by Mutoh by January 2000, brought about by his decisive loss to Chono on January 4. Mutoh took an extended hiatus to rehabilitate his damaged knees after that, focusing instead on one last run in America for World Championship Wrestling alongside Vampiro. Due to the bad booking and the decline of WCW in its last years, however, Mutoh could not recapture the previous popularity he had in the late 1980s and early 1990s. After leaving WCW, a no-compete clause in his WCW contract prevented him from competing in the World Wrestling Federation.</p>\\n\\n<p>Going back on hiatus, it seemed as if Mutoh reached a confusing crossroads in his career; however, he chose to completely change his image, shaving his head bald (he had a pronounced receding hairline throughout much of 2000), growing out a goatee, and aligning himself with a fellow NJPW wrestler who had gone overseas for an extended period of time, Shinjiro Otani. The two returned to New Japan on January 4, 2001 at Wrestling World 2001, making short work of Manabu Nakanishi and Jushin Thunder Liger. In his first singles match after returning to New Japan on March 18, 2001, Mutoh debuted his new trademark move, the <i>Shining Wizard</i>. Since its creation, it has become an extremely popular move on both sides of the Pacific, used by Mutoh's allies, rivals, and fans of his work. Together with Don Frye, Otani and Mutoh created a new stable which later came to be known as BATT (Bad Ass Translate Trading). Added to their ranks were Taiy\\u014d Kea of All Japan Pro Wrestling and Jinsei Shinzaki of Michinoku Pro; later added was Hiroshi Hase, now a member of All Japan with Kea. 2001 proved to be Mutoh's year of renewal besides the formation of a new unit, as he challenged, and defeated, Tenryu for All Japan's coveted Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. In addition, Mutoh captured more gold in the form of All Japan's World Tag Team Championship and IWGP Tag Team Championship in the summer and fall of 2001, both with Taiy\\u014d Kea\\u2014giving Mutoh a total of six belts at one time.</p>\\n<p>On January 4, 2008, at Wrestle Kingdom II in Tokyo Dome, under the Muta persona, he defeated Hirooki Goto. On April 27, 2008, Mutoh beat Shinsuke Nakamura to win his fourth IWGP Heavyweight Championship, this was his second appearance in 2008 for NJPW and hadn't held the title for eight years and four months prior to the win. Mutoh went on to defend the IWGP championship against Manabu Nakanishi, Togi Makabe and Goto and at New Japan's Destruction '08 show on October 13, he defended the title against Shinsuke Nakamura in a rematch and retained following a Frankensteiner.</p>\\n<p>On January 4, 2009, Mutoh put the IWGP Heavyweight Championship on the line at NJPW's Wrestle Kingdom III in Tokyo Dome against his former student Hiroshi Tanahashi. Mutoh lost the match, when Tanahashi used his signature High Fly Flow twice to get the pin. After the match, Mutoh said backstage that he had passed Tanahashi his sash after doing his best for over half a year to raise the worth of the title, and suggested that he will withdraw and leave New Japan to move their company forward.</p>\\n<p>On January 4, 2012, Mutoh made a return to New Japan at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, where he defeated Tetsuya Naito in a singles match. A year later at Wrestle Kingdom 7 in Tokyo Dome, Mutoh teamed with Shinjiro Otani, a replacement for an injured Daichi Hashimoto, in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima. Mutoh returned to New Japan again a year later at Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome, now working as The Great Muta in a tag team match, where he and Toru Yano defeated <i>Suzukigun</i> (Minoru Suzuki and Shelton X Benjamin). As the only face in the match, Muta turned on Yano towards the end of the match, but his green mist accidentally hit Suzuki instead, leading to Yano pinning him for the win.</p>\\n<h3>All Japan Pro Wrestling (2002\\u20132013)</h3>\\n\\n<p>On January 11, 2002, following the end of a year long cross-promotional <i>angle</i> with New Japan Pro Wrestling, Keiji Mutoh shocked the Japanese wrestling world by defecting to All-Japan as a full-time competitor, taking Satoshi Kojima and Kendo Kashin with him. At the Nippon Budokan on July 20, Mutoh wrestled as three different characters on the card: Kokushi Muso defeating Kaz Hayashi on the second match, himself in the mid-card, and in the second-to-last match, he defeated Kojima, under his \\\"Great Koji\\\" persona, as The Great Muta. On September 30, during an All Japan 30th Anniversary party at the famed Tokyo City Hotel, Mokoto Baba officially announced Mutoh's appointment as the new president of All Japan, transferring all of the Baba family stock to him. Despite this position, however, Mutoh has not stopped wrestling full-time for All Japan, and lead his supporters in feuds with the Voodoo Murders. On December 27, 2003, Mutoh made a return to the United States, wrestling for the Ring of Honor promotion as part of an interpromotional <i>All Japan vs. ROH</i> card, which hosted a series of \\\"dream\\\" matches. In the main event, Mutoh reverted to his Great Muta persona and teamed with Arashi to defeat Prophecy members Christopher Daniels and Dan Maff.</p>\\n<p>He made his European debut on January 12, 2007, wrestling for Real Quality Wrestling at the York Hall in Bethnal Green, London, England, where he defeated RQW Heavyweight Champion Martin Stone in a non-title match. Mutoh recently won the 2007 Champion Carnival, competing in Block A and finishing with 6 points total; Mutoh defeated Toshiaki Kawada in the finals on March 30, 2007.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Keiji_Mutoh_2009.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q927964\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":28498757,\"title\":\"Eder Kurti\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Eder Kurti</b> (born 29 October 1984) is a British Professional boxer with Albanian heritage who competes in the supper middleweight division currently residing in Woolwich, London.</p>\\n<p>Kurti turned pro in 2004 and in June 2010 Kurti was a reserve for the Super-Middleweights prizefighter competition at York Hall, Bethnal Green.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q5337037\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":15472000,\"title\":\"Albert Sosnowski\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Albert Dariusz Sosnowski</b> (born 7 March 1979 in Warsaw, Poland) is a Polish professional boxer who fights in the heavyweight division.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q1736935\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":0},{\"pageid\":25193261,\"title\":\"Pietro Aurino\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Pietro Aurino</b> (born November 16, 1976 in Torre Annunziata, Province of Naples) is a retired male boxer from Italy.

Swaby, from Lincoln, England, sent Maccarinelli down with a crushing right hand, knocking Maccarinelli down in the third round. Maccarinelli never took the rematch against Swaby.</p>\\n<p>On 28 June 2003, Maccarinelli, known as \\\"the Big Mac\\\" won the vacant WBU cruiserweight title when he defeated Bruce Scott by fourth-round TKO.

Maccarinelli won the title with a ninth-round TKO. The natural progression was a title fight against the then WBO title holder, Johnny Nelson. Due to several injuries to Nelson this matchup never transpired, and On 22 September 2006 he announced his retirement, automatically relinquishing the belt and allowing Maccarinelli to be promoted to full champion status.</p>\\n<p>On 14 October 2006 Maccarinelli made his first defence of the WBO title, stopping former opponent Mark Hobson in the first round in a fight that was widely expected to last the distance.

The Gunn fight was stopped with just\\u00a0:25 seconds remaining in the first round by referee Mark Nelson, even though Gunn was not down and only had a small cut. It was widely and erroneously reported that Maccarinelli had broken Bobby Gunn's nose, but it was a small cut to the bridge of the nose that caused the bleeding. Gunn's nose was not broken and most observers at ringside thought the fight was stopped prematurely.</p>\\n<p>On 21 July 2007 Maccarinelli defended his WBO cruiserweight championship against former WBC champ Wayne Braithwaite and won by unanimous decision, after dominating the match.

The fight took place on 8 March 2008 at the O2 Arena, London and was much hyped in the weeks running up to the event, being given the tagline \\\"bombs away\\\" (referring to the high KO percentages and punching power both men boasted). Maccarinelli lost the fight and his WBO belt when he was knocked out in the 2nd round. A right hand by Haye knocked Maccarinelli down towards the end of the round and although he was able to get back up it was on unsteady legs and the referee stepped in to stop the fight.</p>\\n<p>After the fight Haye announced that he would be moving up to the heavyweight division with immediate effect and would therefore be vacating his newly won belts. Because of this Maccarinelli received an immediate opportunity to reclaim his WBO belt in a matchup against undefeated American Jonathon Banks for the now vacant championship, but due to injury Banks was forced to pull out. After several replacements were unable to fight, Maccarinelli instead stepped up to heavyweight to face Matthew Ellis. Maccarinelli won after a 2nd round KO in what was his debut at the higher weight. After the fight Frank Warren announced that Maccarinelli would face Banks in a re-scheduled bout for the WBO belt during February 2009.</p>\\n<p>Once again the Banks fight proved to be a non starter (Banks opted to make an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to win the IBF cruiserweight title against Tomasz Adamek) and instead Maccarinelli's next fight was against the American based Londoner Ola Afolabi for the \\\"interim\\\" WBO title. The fight took place on March 14 at the M.E.N. Arena in Manchester, on the undercard of the Amir Khan vs Marco Antonio Barrera bout. Maccarinelli was favoured by most observers to win, however things did not go as expected as Maccarinelli struggled in the early rounds and was staggered in the 3rd round by a short chopping right hand from the slick Afolabi. Despite managing to recover and win the majority of the next few rounds he was knocked out by Afolabi in round 9 when a huge overhand right put him on the canvas and forced the referee to call off the fight.</p>\\n<h2>Lebedev fight, \\\"retirement\\\" and return</h2>\\n\\n<p>Maccarinelli's next fight was against the unbeaten Russian Denis Lebedev on 18 July 2009. As with the Afolabi contest the fight took place at the M.E.N. Arena on the undercard of an Amir Khan fight, this time Khan's WBA light-welterweight title challenge against Andreas Kotelnik. From the very beginning of the fight Maccarinelli struggled with the power of his opponent and by the end of the second round his right eye had swollen completely shut from the punches landed by Lebedev. In the third round Lebedev rocked Maccarinelli with an uppercut which landed cleanly through his guard and after a further barrage of unanswered punches the referee stepped in and called a stop to the fight.</p>\\n<p>Before the fight Maccarinelli had admitted that the contest represented \\\"the last chance saloon\\\" in terms of getting his career back on track, following 2 KO losses in his last 3 fights, and talking immediately after the defeat he hinted that this latest setback could signal the end of his boxing career. In an interview with his local paper a few days later Maccarinelli apparently confirmed his intention to retire from the sport, although he retracted this in a later interview with the same source.</p>\\n<p>Maccarinelli began his latest comeback attempt on another Amir Khan undercard, this time Khan's WBA Light-Welterweight title defence against on December 5 at the Metro Radio Arena in Newcastle. His opponent was the relatively unknown Hungarian journeyman Krisztian Jaksi. who provided little resistance and was knocked out in the 1st round. Maccarinelli managed a second consecutive 1st round KO victory against Hungarian opposition when he defeated Zoltan Czekus at the Echo Arena Liverpool on 13 March 2010.</p>\\n<h2>EBU title shot</h2>\\n<p>Following his two quick comeback wins Maccarinelli's next fight took place on 27 April 2010 when he fought Russian prospect Alexander Kotlobay in St Petersburg for the vacant European cruiserweight title. Despite now being the fighter that had to travel and fight on someone else's patch, Maccarinelli scored his third consecutive quick victory when he knocked Kotlobay down with an overhand right before the referee stepped in to end the fight at 2:15 of the first round.</p>\\n<p>His first defence of his newly won title came as part of Frank Warren's \\\"Magnificent Seven\\\" fight card, which took place on 18 September 2010 at the LG Arena in Birmingham. His opponent for this defence was the undefeated Ukrainian prospect Alexander Frenkel. Despite a tentative opening round Maccarinelli improved and managed to rock his opponent in the fourth round with a right hand. A clash of heads in the sixth led to a cut developing over his right eye, however the fight still appeared to be going Maccarinelli's way until he was knocked down heavily towards the end of round seven by a left hook from Frenkel. Despite managing to rise by the count of nine he was extremely unsteady and appeared to be in no position to defend himself. However the referee allowed the bout to continue, only for it to be stopped a few seconds later when a three punch combination from Frenkel led to a second knockdown. The final blows were struck with such ferocity that Maccarinelli was knocked unconscious and required oxygen and medical attention before being able to leave the ring. At the time of the fight there was heavy criticism from both journalists and fellow boxers at the decision by the referee to allow the fight to continue after the first knockdown, when it was clear that Maccarinelli was in no position to defend himself.</p>\\n<p>As with the aftermath of the Afolabi and Lebedev defeats there were also been calls for Maccarinelli to retire from the ring, something which the boxer himself admitted to the press was a distinct possibility following his fourth KO loss in eight fights.</p>\\n<h2>Move to Light Heavyweight</h2>\\n<p>After a period of inactivity following the Frenkel defeat, in February 2011 Maccarinelli announced that rather than retiring he would instead be dropping down in weight to compete in the 175\\u00a0lb Light Heavyweight division, with a view to having his first fight at the weight limit later on in the year.</p>\\n<p>Several months later he made the further announcement that he would once again be working with former coach Enzo Calzaghe, who was part of Maccarinelli's team during his successful run at cruiserweight. At the same time he also expressed a desire to fight for a world title at the new weight limit in the future, and in particular put forward the idea of an all Welsh title fight between himself and current WBO belt holder Nathan Cleverly.</p>\\n<p>Exactly 14 months after his last in-ring appearance Maccarinelli's first fight at the new weight limit took place at the York Hall in Bethnal Green on November 18, 2011. As with 2 of his previous 4 fights at cruiserweight the opponent was a Hungarian fighter, this time the undefeated (and relatively unknown) Gyorgy Marosi. Maccarinelli emerged victorious, scoring a 1st round TKO victory after just 91 seconds against an overmatched Marosi.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Enzo_Maccarinelli.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q928194\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":26736864,\"title\":\"Sam Webb (boxer)\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Sam Webb</b> (born 11 April 1981) is an English professional boxer fighting in the light middleweight division.

He won the 1983 and 1984 West Michigan Division Junior Title (156\\u00a0lb), 1987 Novice Golden Gloves in Manchester (156\\u00a0lb), 1987 Michigan Silver Gloves (156\\u00a0lb) and 1988 Ohio State Fair (156\\u00a0lb)</p>\\n<p>Toney had his first professional fight on October 26, 1988, beating Stephen Lee by a technical knockout in the second round. He was scouted and trained by Gregory Owens as a teenager, who also was his trainer through the mid-nineties. His moniker of \\\"Lights Out\\\" was also given by either Gregory or his son.</p>\\n<p>On March 10, 1989, his manager Johnny \\\"Ace\\\" Smith was killed outside of the Page One Bar in Detroit. Jackie Kallen then became his manager. He won the Michigan Middleweight title in 1990, knocking out Philip Morefield in the 1st round.</p>\\n<p>A draw with Sanderline Williams was the first blemish on Toney's record, although he beat Williams by unanimous decision three months later and in early 1991 he beat Merqui Sosa in a minor upset, between the two top-10-rated contenders.</p>\\n<h3>Middleweight champion</h3>\\n<p>Toney's unbeaten run landed him a shot at Lineal &amp; IBF Middleweight Champion Michael \\\"Second to\\\" Nunn, in May 1991. Nunn dominated the relatively inexperienced Toney over the first 10 rounds with his excellent boxing skills. In an unusually aggressive performance, there were many heated exchanges, but in the 11th round, with time running out for the young Toney, he dropped Michael Nunn to the canvas. The fight was stopped and Toney was the new IBF Middleweight champion.</p>\\n<p>Toney continued a regular fight program over the next 18 months at middleweight, before outgrowing the division, where he made several successful yet disputed defenses. One of the most noteworthy was Toney's split decision win over Dave Tiberi in a fight that many experts feel Toney lost. The decision was so controversial that it prompted United States Senator William Roth of Delaware to call for an investigation into possible corruption in the sport. Toney also outpointed Glenn Wolfe and tough Reggie Johnson and a draw and a win against Mike \\\"The Body Snatcher\\\" McCallum, in two evenly and heated contests.</p>\\n<h3>Super Middleweight champion</h3>\\n<p>Toney moved up to the 168\\u00a0lbs Super Middleweight division, a weight Toney felt would be to his advantage, after struggling to make the Middleweight limit of 160\\u00a0lbs.</p>\\n<p>On February 13, 1993, he challenged Iran Barkley for his IBF Super Middleweight title. After a dominating performance by Toney, the bout was stopped after 9 rounds by Barkley's trainer, Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, due to Barkley suffering severe swelling around both eyes. With Toney now a title holder at 168\\u00a0lbs, alongside Nigel Benn, Chris Eubank and his old nemesis Michael Nunn, the division was now one of the strongest in boxing.</p>\\n<p>Toney remained one of the most active boxers in the sport, winning five mark-time fights throughout 1993, then defeating Tony \\\"The Punching Postman\\\" Thornton in his 1st title defense in October, via a landslide points victory. In his second defense, Toney beat the 24\\u20130 Tim Littles by a 4th round KO. During this bout, Toney suffered a bad cut which caused the referee and ringside doctor to intervene before round 4, allowing him one more round to try to end the fight. His next defense was against former IBF Light Heavyweight champion Prince Charles Williams, whom he knocked out in the 12th and final round. This win paved the way for his fight with Roy Jones, Jr..</p>\\n<p>The fight was Jones' first at Super Middleweight; Jones vacated his Middleweight belt to challenge Toney on November 18, 1994. The fight was the biggest and most anticipated fight of the year with Jones and Toney ranked highly in the pound-for-pound rankings going into the fight. Toney was fancied to win by many experts due to his superior level of competition he'd faced up to this point.</p>\\n<p>Jones won a landslide decision over Toney, an upset at the time, taking Toney apart and briefly flooring Toney for the first time with a flash knockdown in the 3rd round. (Jones used one of his \\\"cockfighting\\\" feigns to lure Toney in, and as Toney mocked Jones, Toney got caught with a leaping left hook.) After the fight Toney blamed making the weight for his flat performance and the loss of his cherished unbeaten record. It was his last fight at the weight.</p>\\n<p>His next fight after losing his title to Roy Jones saw him lose to Montell Griffin at light heavyweight in February 1995. After then winning a series of fights at light heavyweight, cruiserweight, and even heavyweight, he again faced Montell Griffin in December 1996 and once again lost a close decision. He beat old foe Mike McCallum in February 1997, but then lost to journeyman Drake Thadzi in his next fight.</p>\\n<h3>Cruiserweight champion</h3>\\n<p>After taking some time off from the ring, Toney came back in 1999, seemingly focused on reclaiming his status as an elite fighter. He defeated former title holders and title contenders Adolpho Washington, Steve Little and Saul Montana, as well as Sione Asipeli, Courtney Butler, and Michael Rush. In August 2002, Toney beat Jason Robinson in an IBF Cruiserweight title elimination fight. This set up a fight between Toney and the champion, Vassiliy Jirov. After a postponement, the fight happened on April 26, 2003. Going into the 12th and final round, with the scores fairly even and the fight in the balance, Toney knocked the undefeated Jirov down in the 12th. The Kazakh rose from the canvas to go to the distance, but Toney got the judges verdict and was now a three-weight World Champion.</p>\\n<p>For Toney's performance he was awarded comeback of the year and named fighter of the year. The fight itself was named \\\"Fight Of The Year\\\" by <i>The Ring</i> magazine. Immediately afterward, Toney moved up to heavyweight.</p>\\n<h3>Heavyweight</h3>\\n<p>Even when Toney was a middleweight, he insisted that he would one day be the heavyweight champion of the world. His October 4, 2003, victory over aging former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield was Toney's entry into the heavyweight division. After a shaky first round, Toney picked the Atlanta legend apart with shots to the body and head before stopping him in the 9th round. After the fight Toney declared he was \\\"undestructable\\\", that he \\\"got milk baby\\\" and didn't want any \\\"bad ass questions\\\" from announcer Jim Gray.</p>\\n<p>On April 30, 2005, he defeated John Ruiz by a unanimous decision in a 12-round match for the World Boxing Association (WBA) heavyweight Championship. However, Toney failed his post-fight drug test, testing positive for the anabolic steroid stanozolol. This led to the New York Athletic Commission changing the bout's official outcome to a \\\"no-contest\\\", deducting the win from Toney's career record and banning him from boxing for 90 days. The WBA ordered that Ruiz be reinstated as its champion and that Toney be ineligible for another WBA Heavyweight title shot for two years. Toney defended himself by claiming that the steroids were given to him by a doctor to treat an injured arm that occurred during his victory over Rydell Booker in his previous fight. Toney was also subject to a civil lawsuit by Ruiz claiming that Toney's illegal use of steroids gave him an edge in the fight.</p>\\n<p>In his bout after the Ruiz fight, Toney won a unanimous decision victory over former heavyweight contender Dominic Guinn. Toney next fought against Hasim Rahman on March 18, 2006, for the WBC Heavyweight title. The result was a twelve-round majority draw and Toney weighed a career-high 237\\u00a0lb for his lackluster performance.</p>\\n<p>Toney's next two outings were losses to Samuel Peter. The first fight was held in Los Angeles, California on September 2, 2006. Toney lost by split decision. The return bout was held in Hollywood, Florida, on January 6, 2007, and Toney once again lost to Peter, this time by unanimous decision. Both fights were WBC eliminator bouts for the belt held by Oleg Maskaev.</p>\\n<p>Toney returned to action in May 2007 and won a ten-round split decision over Danny Batchelder. Following the bout, Toney once again tested positive for boldenone and stanozolol and was fined $2500 and banned from boxing for a year, Toney appealed the suspension and it was reduced to 6 months after he appeared before the CSAC and claimed he did not knowingly take any steroids and suggested that he was set up and someone had tampered with his water bottle.</p>\\n<p>On July 16, 2008, Toney's rematch against Hasim Rahman was stopped in the third round. An accidental clash of heads to the outside of Rahman's brow opening a cut above Rahman's left eye to the inside of the brow leading to the stoppage. Rahman told the ring doctor he could not see, the ring doctor then stopped the fight. Initially, the fight was called as a TKO win for Toney, but this was overruled by the California State Athletic Commission and the fight was declared no-contest. Rahman went on to fight Wladimir Klitschko for the IBF, IBO and WBO Heavyweight titles in his next fight.</p>\\n<p>Toney's next bout came on December 13, 2008, against Fres Oquendo. Oquendo was penalized one point in round eight for a rabbit punch, which would prove to be the deciding factor in the fight. Toney won a close, controversial split decision. On September 12, 2009, James fought heavyweight fighter Matthew Greer (12\\u20135\\u20130 11KO) at the Pechanga Resort &amp; Casino. James won via TKO victory in round two.</p>\\n<p>On February 24, 2011, Toney made his return to boxing and won a ten round unanimous decision against Damon Reed. All three judges scored the bout 100\\u201390. For this bout Toney weighed in at a career high of 257\\u00a0lbs.</p>\\n<p>On April 7, 2012 Toney fought Bobby Gunn and won by a fifth round stoppage due to a hand injury sustained by Gunn. More than one year later on April 28, 2013 James Toney returned to take on Lucas Browne in Australia, for the WBF heavyweight title and lost by wide unanimous decision. He will not consider retirement but his future is now unclear.</p>\\n<h3>Return to Cruiserweight</h3>\\n<p>On November 4, 2011, Toney stepped into the ring at 199\\u00a0lbs, the lowest he has been since 2003 against Russian star Denis Lebedev in Russia for the interim WBA World cruiserweight title. Toney was never competitive throughout the bout after encountering problems with his left knee during round two, and the judges all had it 108 \\u2013 120. A week after the fight it was revealed Toney needed surgery to repair his knee.</p>\\n<h3>Prizefighter International Heavyweights 2013</h3>\\n<p>It was announced that Toney will compete in Matchroom Sports Prizefighter Series at Heavyweight, it will be the 3rd Prizefighter in which International Heavyweights will compete. It will also be a 1st in a special UK v US tournament, the event took Place on November 14, 2013, at Bethnal Green's York Hall on its usual channel of Sky Sports HD.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/James_Toney.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q535572\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":8480231,\"title\":\"Kevin Johnson (boxer)\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Kevin \\\"Kingpin\\\" Johnson</b> (born September 7, 1979 in Asbury Park, New Jersey) is an American heavyweight boxer.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q448375\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":0},{\"pageid\":19570192,\"title\":\"Lee Haskins\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Lee Haskins</b> (born 29 November 1983) is a British professional boxer from Bristol in England who has fought in the Flyweight, Super Flyweight and Bantamweight divisions.

By the time he had compiled a winning ledger of 9-0 he challenged journeyman fighter Delroy Spencer for the English Flyweight title and claimed the belt after Spencer retired after the third round of the 10 round contest. In February 2006 almost three years from his professional debut and now with a winning record of 13-0 Haskins challenged the Tanzanian fighter Anthony Mathias for the vacant Commonwealth Flyweight title. He stopped Mathias in the 2nd round at The Pavilions in Plymouth to pick up his second career title.</p>\\n<h3>Commonwealth title fights</h3>\\n<p>Following the victory over Mathias, Haskins returned to Bristol just two months later for his first defence against South African Zolile Mbityi.

He scored his first win as a professional in his next fight, travelling to Yarm to beat John Green over six rounds. Five more fights happened in 1997 (all wins) for Witter to end the year with a record of 6-0-1. Witters next year as a professional started in the same way as his first; a draw over Mark Grundy! Despite this he fought four more times during the year meaning that at the end of only his second year as a pro he had compiled of record of 12-0-2 scoring decent wins along the way over the likes of Jan Piet Bergman (35-1) and Mark Winters (13-1). The beginning of 1999 begun with a two-round win over Malcolm Melvin.</p>\\n<h3>Defeat to Judah</h3>\\n<p>Witter gained four more victories, then in June 2000, with a record of 15-0-2, he was given a late-notice shot at a world title against American Zab Judah. The fight, which took place in Glasgow in Scotland on the undercard of Mike Tyson's fight with Lou Savarese, ended with first career defeat for the Englishman. Witter lasted the distance but lost on points to the champion. Speaking of the fight later on in his career and when he himself had finally won a World title, Witter said \\\"It was a shot in the dark. During my first few years as a pro, I was struggling like mad financially, so when the shot came about it meant a really big payday. I thought: if I don't take it, I've got nothing - all my savings were gone and all my loans were on top of me. As far as the fight went, I didn't have enough experience. I wasn't even British champion and I had nine days to prepare for a shot at Judah, one of the best fighters in the world. I lost on points, but I learned so much. It taught me that I deserved to be at that level.\\\"</p>\\n<h3>British, Commonwealth and European champion</h3>\\n<p>Witter's response to his first defeat was to go the traditional route towards another crack at a World belt. Witter fought six more times since the Judah defeat beating the likes of Steve Conway (TKO 4) and Colin Mayisela (TKO 2) before, in March 2002, meeting Alan Bosworth for the vacant British light welterweight title claiming the belt with a stoppage in the third round. Witter's next fight saw him pick up the vacant Commonwealth title with a win over Ghanain Laatekwei Hammond. Two more fights in 2002 saw him beat Lucky Sambo in a non-title fight and Italian Giuseppe Lauri in an eliminator for the WBO light welterweight title.</p>\\n<p>Only two fights in 2003 saw the double champion add to his collection when in April 2003 he beat Belgian Jurgen Haeck for the European Union title. A first defence of his Commonwealth title took place in September at the MEN Arena in Manchester with a win in the 2nd round giving victory over Kenyan Fred Kinuthia. Witter finally challenged for the full European title in June 2004 beating Italian Salvatore Battaglia at the Ice Arena in Nottingham. The year ended for Witter with a first defence of his European crown at the Conference Center in Wembley beating Polish fighter Krzyztof Bienias.</p>\\n<h3>Route to the World title</h3>\\n<p>In February 2005, Witter travelled to Los Angeles for a WBC Light Welterweight eliminator against Australian-based Lovemore N'dou. The fight which also doubled as a further defence of his Commonwealth title ended with a 12 round points decision win for the man from Bradford. In July of the same year Witter returned to the Ice Arena in Nottingham to score a win over Ukrainian Andriy Kotelnik in a close fought fight which was also a defence of his European title. Witter finished the year with a win over fellow Brit Colin Lynes in a fight which saw his British, Commonwealth and European titles all on the line at the same time. The fight, this time at the York Hall in London, ended with another points victory over 12 rounds for Witter.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q948665\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":42803977,\"title\":\"Lucas Browne\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Lucas 'Big Daddy' Browne</b>, born in Auburn, New South Wales, Australia on April 14, 1979.

In three years at London Road he scored 49 goals in 103 games.</p>\\n<p>He joined Norwich from Peterborough in December 2003 for a fee of \\u00a3325,000, and instantly won over the Canaries supporters by scoring twice on his debut to help beat local rivals Ipswich Town at Portman Road and go top of the First Division. His goals made a significant contribution to Norwich's promotion to the Premier League as First Division champions at the end of the 2003\\u201304 season. Within a year, he had turned from a Second Division to a Premiership player. McKenzie took time to find his feet in the Premiership but he established a strike partnership with Dean Ashton which would become one of the most potent in the division during the closing stages of the 2004\\u201305 season. His goals helped Norwich to haul themselves into contention to avoid the drop, although they were relegated on the last day of the season.</p>\\n<p>He came third in the Norwich City Supporters Player of The Season vote for the 2004\\u201305, beaten by Darren Huckerby and Damien Francis. The 2005\\u201306 season for McKenzie was interrupted by injuries and personal difficulties surrounding the break-up of his marriage. At the start of the 2006\\u201307 campaign, he handed in a transfer request to manager Nigel Worthington. Although Worthington rejected McKenzie's request, he subsequently confirmed that McKenzie would be sold if they received an offer that matched the club's valuation of the player.</p>\\n<p>McKenzie was signed by Coventry City on transfer deadline day in August 2006 for an initial \\u00a3600,000 that, depending on appearances and promotion, could rise to \\u00a31m. Ironically, Coventry's first match after signing McKenzie was against Norwich \\u2013 however, McKenzie was unable to play due to a condition of the transfer that prevented him from playing in either of the two fixtures between Coventry and Norwich in the 2006\\u201307 season. He made his debut for Coventry on 12 September 2006 as a substitute against Ipswich Town at Portman Road. He started the 2007\\u201308 season well, scoring against Barnsley on the opening day of the season and against Hull, before a knee injury put him out of action for several weeks. He scored in Coventry's opening game of the 2008\\u201309 season against his old club, Norwich City. This marked McKenzie's 100th professional career goal and he celebrated by revealing a vest with \\\"100\\\" on it. He was subsequently booked for his celebration.</p>\\n<p>On 1 September 2009 it was confirmed that he had signed for Charlton Athletic. He scored his first and only goal for Charlton against Southampton in the Football League Trophy on 11 November 2009. He was one of six players to be released by Charlton Athletic following the end of the 2009\\u201310 league season. On 8 September 2010 it was confirmed he had signed a contract with Northampton Town until the end of 2010\\u201311 season.</p>\\n<p>McKenzie featured in a friendly for Conference club Luton Town against Bedford Town prior to the 2011\\u201312 season. On 15 December 2011 Mckenzie announced his retirement from professional football. He played his final game on 17 December 2011, after which he planned to move on to his music career ambitions. In July 2012, however, McKenzie came out of retirement to sign for Conference North side Corby Town. </p>\\n<p>On 1 January 2013 Mckenzie played his last football game for Conference North side Corby Town and is now officially retired from football.</p>\\n<h2>Personal life</h2>\\n<p>He is the son of former British and European boxing champion Clinton McKenzie and nephew of three time world boxing champion Duke McKenzie and former boxer and current politician Winston McKenzie. Leon is now a singing artist, his 1st single (Finally) was released on iTunes and features celebrity big brother's MC Harvey. Leon has written an Autobiography which was published by MacAnthony Media, and was released on 29 November 2012.</p>\\n<p>McKenzie has admitted battling depression. He was jailed for six months on 21 February 2012 for trying to avoid speeding convictions. In December 2011 McKenzie admitted that he had tried to commit suicide whilst a player with Charlton.</p>\\n<p>As well as still playing, he is now involved with music teaming up with CBB'S MC Harvey. Leon also works for Elite Welfare Management, a not-for-profit organisation which offers confidential support and advice to players suffering from depression. Following his retirement from playing football he is currently following in his father's Clinton McKenzie and uncle's Duke McKenzie footsteps and embarking on a career in boxing.</p>\\n<h2>Boxing career</h2>\\n<p>McKenzie made his boxing debut on 29 June 2013 when he fought John Mason in York Hall, Bethnal Green in London.

Boxing on the same bill as Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan at London's Excel Arena, all three brothers scored winning debuts. Liam Walsh faced journeyman Daniel Thorpe and made a quick start with a first round win. Speaking of his debut victory Walsh said <i>\\\"I knocked him down but he got back up. I caught him with a good right hand and I don't think he fancied the job after that.\\\"</i> Walsh followed up the victory with further wins in 2008 over journeymen Johnny Greaves and Youssef Al Hamidi. In 2009 Walsh defeated Shaun Walton, Baz Carey and Jon Baguley. In 2010 Walsh expanded his record to 9 wins against no defeats with victories over Sid Razak, Ibrar Riyaz and the Frenchman Sebastien Cornu.</p>\\n<h3>Commonwealth Champion</h3>\\n<p>On 23 October 2010 Walsh headlined a bill for the first time at the York Hall in Bethnal Green. The occasion was a challenge for the Commonwealth super featherweight title recently vacated by Scotsman Ricky Burns. Walsh defeated his co-challenger for the belt, the Ghanaian Maxwell Awuku who had had a record of 20 wins and one defeat before that fight, over the full 12 rounds in a grueling contest. Prior to the victory, brothers Michael and Ryan had also scored wins on the bill defeating Ian Bailey and James Ancliff respectively. On 20 March 2010 Walsh made his first successful defence of the title, traveling to Wigan to beat local man John Kays with a stoppage in the 9th round. The second defence of his title came on 30 September 2011 with Walsh meeting former British champion Paul Appleby in a thrilling fight at the York Hall.

In 1991 Williams won the PLA tournament and won a gold medal in Sardinia multination tournament and a gold medal in a Greek multinations tournament. In a Finland multinations in 1992 he won a bronze medal.</p>\\n<p>Williams won a bronze medal at the European Championships 1993 at heavyweight in the 91\\u00a0kg/201\\u00a0lbs limit and bronze at super heavyweight at the 1994 Commonwealth Games. Williams also won a gold medal at the 1994 Liverpool multinations tournament. His amateur record was 29\\u20136.</p>\\n<h2>Professional career</h2>\\n<p>Williams turned pro in 1995 knocking out Vance Ideans in two rounds. He fought routinely on Frank Warren undercards and compiled a 15\\u20130 (12 knockouts) record. He is currently managed by London promoter Michael Helliet and is trained by Jim McDonagh. He took his first big step up in April 1999 to challenge Julius Francis for his British and Commonwealth heavyweight titles. A hot favourite, Williams was outboxed and lost a points decision to the 34 year old veteran.</p>\\n<p>Francis would later vacate the Commonwealth title for a big money fight with Mike Tyson. Williams won the title with a closely contested split decision over respected British contender (and former amateur clubmate) Harry Senior.</p>\\n<h3>British and Commonwealth champion</h3>\\n<p>In 2000 Williams put together four knockouts before fighting Mark Potter for the Commonwealth title and the vacant British title. In a dramatic fight, Williams suffered a grotesque dislocated right arm, yet very bravely fought on with one arm and knocked Potter out with a left uppercut.</p>\\n<p>After an eight month layoff for surgery and recovery, Williams returned to bomb out Kali Meehan in 32 seconds, then avenged his defeat to Francis, stopping the 36 year old on an eye injury in the 4th round. Afterwards he was signed by Don King and ended 2001 knocking out US journeyman Shaun Robinson in two rounds on an undercard in America. His tenure under King would prove to be uneventful, and he did not renew his contract at the end of 2002, a year that saw Williams retain his British and Commonwealth titles with a knockout of late sub Michael Sprott and a points win over Keith Long. As this was Williams' third defence of the British title, he won the Lonsdale belt outright, before dropping out of a fight in America with hard hitting South African southpaw Corrie Sanders, because it coincided with Ramadan.</p>\\n<h3>European title shot</h3>\\n<p>In February 2003 Williams travelled to Germany to fight the Turk Sinan Samil Sam for his European heavyweight title. A hot favourite, Williams was surprisingly dropped three times and stopped in six rounds. In the UK, his local rivals Audley Harrison and Herbie Hide derided him in the press.</p>\\n<p>Williams returned with a fourth round stoppage of Australian Bob Mirovic to retain his Commonwealth title, then knocked out Michael Sprott in five rounds to defend his British &amp; Commonwealth titles.</p>\\n<p>To begin 2004, Williams re-signed with Frank Warren then lost his British and Commonwealth in a third meeting with Michael Sprott via a disputed close points decision.</p>\\n<h3>Tyson vs Williams</h3>\\n\\n<p>After two comeback knockout wins, Williams boxed former world champion Mike Tyson in Freedom Hall State Fairground, Louisville, Kentucky in July 2004. After staggering Williams numerous times in the first round, Tyson suffered ligament damage to his knee towards the end of the round, which hampered his ability to throw power punches. As Tyson began to tire in the fourth round, Williams threw a torrent of punches, forcing Tyson to go down. Tyson was counted out sitting with his back to the ropes and made no attempt to get to his feet while looking up at the referee.</p>\\n<h3>WBC title shot</h3>\\n<p>In December he finally challenged for a world heavyweight title, but Vitali Klitschko proved too much, as Williams was stopped in the 8th round.</p>\\n<h3>Return to domestic level</h3>\\n<p>In December Williams regained his old Commonwealth belt by beating undefeated Olympic gold medallist Audley Harrison by split decision. Williams retained the Commonwealth title with a controversial points win over undefeated Matt Skelton in March 2006. After beating Adnan Serin by a third round retirement, Williams lost His Commonwealth title by unanimous decision in a rematch with Skelton</p>\\n<p>In December 2006 when Skelton dropped out of a fight with Audley Harrison, Williams stepped in at a weeks notice. By his own admission he had been training for eight weeks for a fight with British champion Scott Gammer. Williams lost by T.K.O. in the 3rd round, suffering a broken nose.</p>\\n<p>In March 2007 Williams regained the British title in Wales with a 9th round knockout of Scott Gammer. Williams came in at the lightest he had been since his pro debut 16 stones 4 pounds {4 stones lighter than his previous fight} after training himself for the fight just with a piece of paper that contained a conditioning programme given to him by Joe Dunbar who had worked with Lennox Lewis.</p>\\n<p>After he had watched the tape of his fight with Gammer, Williams decided he would continue boxing and took a fight with 26\\u20131 22 KOs Ukrainian prospect Oleg Platov. He came in again at 270\\u00a0lbs. Both fighters were engaged in wild exchanges from the first bell on. The Ukrainian picked up a badly-bleeding cut above the left eye following an accidental headbutt in the second round and he continued to swing wild punches but not without taking some huge shots from Williams. After 2:15 in the fourth and with the cut getting worse, the referee waved the fight off. According to the rules of the IBF, it was declared a no contest. Sauerland managing director Chris Meyer defended the decision. \\\"The rules are clear,\\\" he said. \\\"We had an accidental headbutt and the referee, who consulted the doctor several times, ruled he could not continue to protect his health. Speaking exclusively to SecondsOut after the fight a disappointed Williams said: \\u201cHe (Platov) was looking for a way out and he got it. He knew the rules and worked them. He was starting to tire and knew it was only a matter of time before I knocked him out. ...I found it slow in the early rounds but I when I got going I started to get on top. He knew I was gonna knock him out and he was looking for a way out. I\\u2019m not sure whether or not it was a punch or a head clash that cut him in the second round. It took be a little while to get going but I really enjoyed it, it was a great fight while it lasted. But he was looking for a way out. He kept falling to the floor and it was only a matter of time before I knocked him out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>On 30 May 2008 Williams defeated unbeaten German, Konstantin Airich in a highly controversial fight. Williams had a total of 3 points deducted in rounds 2 and 5 creating a feeling afterwards that the referee was blatantly on the side of the German. In addition he was given 2 standing 8 counts by the referee in round 3 despite not actually being knocked down or touching the canvas, and was also counted after slipping in round 4. After managing to fight back and score a knockdown himself in round 5, in the 6th round Williams unleashed a series of extremely punishing blows on his opponent sending him reeling across the ring. At this point Airich's promoter Ahmet Oner controversially ran over and rang the timekeeper's bell himself to end the round and save his fighter, even though there was still 1:28 left to go in the round. Despite this confusion the fight continued after the shortened 6th round and after seeing his man absorb more heavy punishment in the next round Oner eventually threw in the towel handing Williams a 7th round TKO victory.</p>\\n<p>In the aftermath of the fight Williams was extremely critical of the performance of both the referee and fight promoters, and has called for the British Boxing Board of Control to conduct an immediate investigation into the fight.</p>\\n<p>Williams faced John McDermott at Goresbrook Leisure Centre, Dagenham on 18 July 2008. Despite being deducted three points in rounds eleven and twelve, he defeated McDermott in a majority points decision.</p>\\n<h3>Williams vs Sosnowski</h3>\\n<p>He was due to face John McDermott in a rematch at York Hall on 8 November 2008, but McDermott withdrew due to a rib injury. Williams also faced a bout with Francois Botha on 30 November 2008 in Egypt.

A total of 196,843 burials had taken place there as of the year 2000. It is a Local Nature Reserve.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Location</h2>\\n<p>The official address of Abney Park is Stoke Newington High Street, N16. The main gate is at the junction of this street and Rectory Road, with a smaller gate on Stoke Newington Church Street. The park lies within the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<h2>Past and present</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1840, Abney Park opened as a model garden cemetery, a pioneering non-denominational place of rest. Its approach was based on the Congregational church's role in the London Missionary Society (LMS), whose fundamental principle was to develop a wholly non-denominational exemplar. It also drew on American burial ideas, specifically Mount Auburn in Massachusetts. Details of the Abney Park Cemetery Company can be found in the diaries of William Copeland Astbury (volumes covering 1831\\u201348)</p>\\n<p>At first there were many links between Abney Park Cemetery and the LMS but this nonconformist (and in particular Congregationalist) period came to a close in the early 1880s when a strictly commercial general cemetery company was formed and the land at Abney Park was made over to the new enterprise. Though the park had not been formalised in 1840 as a cemetery through Act of Parliament or consecration, and Church faculty law never applied, burial ground use, had, by the 1880s, already come to predominate over the wider landscape, access and educational objects of its founders.</p>\\n<p>The founders' financial and legal structure, adapted from the model developed for garden cemeteries in the America by City solicitor George Collison, aimed to establish a joint stock corporation managed by trustees. The trustees would be appointed by the members (those buying plots). Under the trust deed, the founders sought to preserve the park in perpetuity. The weakness of the model lay in the detail however, but this was not evident for thirty years. An eventual successful prosecution by the Crown, ruled that despite their unusual business model and the way in which plots were seemingly sold as freehold land, the legal arrangements were actually inadequate to achieve a different status from any other commercial cemetery, either for the company or the registered keepers of plots. In consequence, company income could not be held in trust for the park, but was to be treated as for any other commercial profit-making company and taxed accordingly.</p>\\n<p>Eventually sold on the open market to a wholly commercially-minded general cemetery company in the 1880s, established with a similar name, three new cemeteries were founded in London's suburbs or nearby countryside. From then onwards standardised park-like landscaping principles came to be applied at Abney Park, replacing much of the unique arboretum planting. Air pollution also took its toll, affecting the conifer walks. After the First World War, path infill began to be practised; a situation that became severe in the 1950s and was continued into the 1970s, when the commercial cemetery company went into liquidation.</p>\\n<p>In 1978, apart from one forecourt building, the park passed to the local council as a burial ground and open space subject to the Local Authorities Cemeteries Order of 1977. For the next twenty-one years, there being only a small number of residual burial and monuments rights, the Council worked with local groups and relatives to accommodate these rights, and exercise discretion to allow occasional courtesy burials, where families had previously held deeds from the cemetery company; but by and large nature was allowed to take its course.</p>\\n<p>Abney Park was included on the Heritage at Risk Register in 2009, as one of Britain's historic parks and gardens at risk from neglect and decay. Although the level of malicious damage is kept low by the conspicuous presence of staff and volunteers of the Abney Park Trust when maintaining the park; by frequent arts and environmental events promoted by the Trust; and by community safety initiatives involving the police and their community support officers; nevertheless, over time it has taken its toll, leading to the current 'at risk' designation. The roof slates and roof flashings of the Abney Park Chapel have been damaged by unauthorised climbing and theft at times when the park was left unsupervised and unlocked overnight, and this has resulted in water seepage into the chapel walls which is now causing serious problems to the whole building. Similarly, from time to time, some sections of boundary wall become too weak due to people climbing over them, and decay has set in. However these matters could be put right and the park is a popular place to visit, with a range of educational, training and cultural events and an annual summer open day. It is a designated Local Nature Reserve and Conservation Area. Apart from the South Lodge extension on the forecourt, Abney Park's freehold is owned by the London Borough of Hackney. The park is situated near Stoke Newington High Street, London N16, and it is leased to the Abney Park Trust. It occupies 12.53 hectares (31.0 acres), which includes a nature reserve, a classroom, a visitor's centre and a central chapel which is disused. The park is normally opened by the Trust for free public access on weekdays and weekends from about 9.30 am to 5 pm, and for access or events agreed with the Trust at all other times.</p>\\n<h2>The Egyptian Revival entrance</h2>\\n<p>One of the \\\"Magnificent Seven\\\" parkland cemeteries created in the early Victorian period, albeit set out in an entirely different way to the others and with somewhat wider purposes, Abney Park features an entrance designed by William Hosking FSA in collaboration with Joseph Bonomi the Younger and the cemetery's founder George Collison II. This frontage was built by John Jay in the then increasingly popular Egyptian Revival style, with hieroglyphics signifying the \\\"Abode of the Mortal Part of Man\\\": a venture too far into the architecture of the African continent for Augustus Pugin, who pilloried the idea, hoping no-one would repeat such a radical departure from \\\"good\\\" Christian gothic design (see illustration for <i>Grounds of a Quaker School</i>). A similar criticism had previously been made when the first Egyptian-style entrance to a western cemetery had been constructed at Mount Auburn Cemetery in the 1830s, on which Abney Park Cemetery was partially modelled. By contrast, figures who appreciated the composition complimented Hosking and Bonomi on their scholarly frontage design; an arbiter of design taste, John Loudon, described it as a \\\"judicious combination of two lodges with gates between\\\".</p>\\n<p>Abney Park has a claim to be the earliest complete design for a permanent \\\"Egyptian Revival\\\" entranceway at a cemetery anywhere in the world. The gateway at Mount Auburn Cemetery, from which it took its inspiration, was at that time still a temporary structure, being made of dusted wood and sand; its permanent design was not built until two years after Abney Park opened. In England there were already some examples of the use of Egyptian Revival architecture on a small scale, including one example of a small gate installed at a cemetery for Nonconformists near Sheffield in 1836. However, Abney Park Cemetery became the first to employ the style for cemetery buildings, and also the first to introduce it for a complete entrance design.</p>\\n\\n<p>At Abney Park the use of motifs not associated with contemporary faith served a profound purpose, since it was consciously opened as the first wholly nondenominational garden cemetery in Europe. True, other garden cemeteries sometimes used the term loosely, meaning only that they had laid out more than one denominational area or built more than one chapel. Abney Park Cemetery was the first to be laid out with \\\"no invidious dividing lines\\\" separating the burial areas of one faith or religious group from any other, and even its one chapel, the Abney Park Chapel, a feast of <i>Puritan</i> or northern European brick gothic yet with ample stone dressings and a little neoclassical design woven into its early Dissenting Gothic design style, had but one central chamber for the common use of all, and but one entrance. As such it was the first nondenominational cemetery chapel in Europe. William Hosking, in being handed the task of achieving this vision, became the first architect to design a nondenominational cemetery chapel in Europe. Underpinning this was a unique legal basis in comparison with the other garden cemeteries of its period; Abney Park was not set aside solely for cemetery use by Act of Parliament, and was not formally consecrated as burial land. Perhaps more so than any other it was entitled to be considered as a park as well as a cemetery.</p>\\n<p>Today it is accommodating this wide role again; burial rights ceased when the private company closed in 1978, enabling the park to now facilitate a wide range of projects in the arts, education, nature conservation and walking/recreation, besides offering new memorial trees and benches where ashes are scattered, and the occasional discretionary or courtesy burial.</p>\\n<h2>Landscape</h2>\\n\\n<p>Abney Park was unique in being the first arboretum to be combined with a cemetery in Europe; offering an educational attraction that was originally set in a landscape of fields and woods, some distance from the built-up boundary of London. Its 2,500 trees and shrubs were all labelled, and arranged around the perimeter alphabetically, from A for <i>Acer</i> (maple trees) to Z for <i>Zanthoxylum</i> (American toothache trees).</p>\\n<p>The emphasis on an educational landscape, as opposed to a purely aesthetic, visually attractive picturesque, drew partly on a simplified version of John Loudon's 'Gardenesque' concept, and applied something akin to this, but with a unique alphabetical approach, and no structural mounding, to a picturesque cemetery design. It was much admired by John Loudon, who described Abney Park Cemetery as \\\"the most highly ornamented cemetery in the vicinity of London\\\", albeit that he favoured a more formal and classical approach to garden cemetery design as a general rule and, in 1843 developed design principles for such an approach.</p>\\n<p>At the Stoke Newington cemetery the botanical planting was carefully sited since the design sought to do as little as possible to change the existing picturesque parkland. This careful approach drew on that used at Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston where Dearborn had emphasised the compatibility of horticulture and even an experimental garden with a cemetery, leading to the opening of a cemetery supported by the Massachusetts Horticultural Society; one that succeeded in establishing a picturesque landscape coupled with botanical garden specimens and an adjoining scientific garden. There were important differences, however; the New England cemetery had benefited from a more sylvan setting than that of Abney Park, and a much larger estate. Nonetheless, the ties were evident. The founding directors of the Abney Park project were all Congregationalists, who together with other nonconformists had strong links with their brethren in the new world, to where they had emigrated in search of religious freedom. George Collison, Abney Park Cemetery's company secretary, and the key force behind its radical design, recorded his visit to, and impressions of, Mount Auburn Cemetery, in a book published to coincide with the opening of the Stoke Newington cemetery. It also contains a complete list of all the arboretum species and varieties planted at Abney Park.</p>\\n<p>The concept of the arboretum -and indeed also a rosarium \\u2013 was inspired by George Loddiges FLS FZS, a local Hackney nurseryman who became a small shareholder in the cemetery company and was appointed to lead its landscape design, planting and educational labelling, to complement William Hosking's layout and building and engineering (drainage) scheme. The pair worked closely as a design team under the guiding influence of the third designer George Collison, who represented the client company both as its solicitor and principal learned visionary. Loddiges' earlier experience in designing an A to Z arboretum at his Mare Street nursery, and possession of one of the largest ranges of trees and shrubs then grown for sale in Britain, ensured success.</p>\\n<p>The overall effect was to establish Abney Park as the most impressively landscaped garden cemetery of its period. However regrettably, Loddiges Nursery closed in the early 1850s and thereafter maintenance of the trees and shrubs and of their botanical labels, was impaired. Today Loddiges' work is of unparalleled significance to landscape design, being recognised as of European importance. Abney Park was the first London cemetery to be invited to join the Association of Significant Cemeteries in Europe (ASCE) and it is the only surviving example of an English landscape designed by George Loddiges FLS FZS.</p>\\n<h2>The <i>Campo Santo</i> of the Dissenters</h2>\\n\\n<p>Such an elaborate planting scheme for a park cemetery may also be a reflection of the symbolic importance the founding directors attached to the land that formed Abney Park Cemetery. As nonconformists, who treasured the independence of their religious beliefs\\u2014and therefore practised Christianity outside of the established Church of England\\u2014they held the land <i>itself</i> to be of immense significance, for it had previously been two neighbouring and inter-related 18th-century parkland estates, the grounds of Abney House and Fleetwood House, where the non-conformist Doctor of Divinity, educationalist and poet Dr. Isaac Watts lived and taught, and indeed wrote several of his popular books and hymns.</p>\\n<p>Due to these religious associations, Abney Park Cemetery rapidly became the most attractive Victorian resting place for nonconformist or dissenting ministers and educationalists, principally those from a Protestant dissenting tradition. Indeed it stands today as the most important burial place in the UK of 19th-century Congregational, Baptist, Methodist and Salvation Army ministers and educationalists, including Christopher Newman Hall and many others, some of whom are mentioned below. Whereas Bunhill Fields was described by the poet Robert Southey as \\\"the <i>Campo Santo</i> of the Dissenters\\\" (a reference to the monumental cemetery of that name in Pisa, Italy \\u2013 <i>campo santo</i> translates as \\\"sacred field\\\" or \\\"saints' abode\\\" ) in respect of its late 17th- and 18th-century burials, Abney Park took on the mantle during the Victorian period in the writings of E. Paxton Hood for the Religious Tract Society.</p>\\n<p>Though it primarily attracted Congregational, Methodist and Salvation Army nonconformists, rather than certain other nonconformists such as Quakers, or non-Protestant nonconformists such as Catholics or Jewish people, Abney Park Cemetery more than any other 19th-century cemetery was open to the burial of all regardless of their religious convictions or leanings. Whilst its founding directors were all Congregationalists and they were concerned to find a place for such burials, they expressly established the Stoke Newington cemetery as the first fully nondenominational cemetery in Europe (where anyone could be buried anywhere). Selection of a site with historical associations with Dr Isaac Watts served this purpose well, for he had been honoured in death with a bust in the Anglican Westminster Abbey to complement his burial at the Independent's Bunhill Fields. Subsequently his hymns and scholarly works had become widely used and referred to by many denominations, such that in the 19th century the Rev. John Stroughton could write: \\\"Dr. Watts was as far removed from sectarianism as a man could be\\\". Abney Park Chapel, sometimes referred to informally as Dr Watts' Chapel, became its spiritual and landscape focal point. It sits in the heart of the cemetery; its axial walk to Church Street, called Dr Watts' Walk, was chosen in 1845 as the most appropriate site in London for a public statue to the great man, sculpted by Edward Hodges Baily, RA FRS.</p>\\n<h2>Educational establishments</h2>\\n<p>Besides its religious associations, Abney Park has a strong educational pedigree. For example, its prominent director in the mid-to-late Victorian era, Charles Reed, was also the Chairman of the London School Board and Hackney's first MP. In fact, this part of north London, particularly Newington Green, had a long history of innovative education for boys and young men, known as dissenting academies.</p>\\n<p>Abney House was the first premises in England to be used exclusively as a Wesleyan training college, from c. 1838. This followed use of temporary, shared facilities in Hackney, and prior to the building of their own spacious colleges and grounds, one in the north of England, and a second at Richmond Hill, to which the college at Abney Park moved in 1843. Abney House was then demolished. The governorship of the seminary was held by Rev. John Farrar, Secretary of the Methodist Conference on fourteen occasions and twice its elected President.</p>\\n<p>Next to Abney House on Church Street was Fleetwood House, used as the base for Newington Academy for Girls, which was founded in 1824 by, among others, the Quaker scientist and abolitionist William Allen and run in a most enlightened and imaginative way by Susanna Corder, who later emigrated for a while to Boston and emerged as a talented biographer. It lost exclusive use of attractive grounds in the eastern part of Abney Park on formation of the cemetery, leaving only the school house and a small garden for the private use of the students. However, they were welcome to use the new cemetery's educational arboretum and this, along with Abney Park as a whole, was rarely shared with many others in the early years of the new cemetery, except at weekends. The school's innovative approach included transport arrangements; it commissioned the first school bus in the world.</p>\\n<h2>Famous people: burials and associations in the park</h2>\\n\\n<p>Most notably, William and Catherine Booth, founders of The Salvation Army, are buried in a prominent location close to Church Street and next to their son Bramwell Booth and various SA commissioners, including Elijah Cadman, John Lawley, William Ridsdel, Frederick Booth-Tucker, George Scott Railton, the Army's first Commissioner, Theodore Kitching and T. Henry Howard, its Chief of Staff.</p>\\n<p>Earlier in the 19th century, one of the hottest issues for political and social reform was the abolition of slavery, and Stoke Newington and the Quakers, separately and together, played a prominent role in this. Indeed, William Wilberforce himself planned to be buried in the village at St Mary's Church with his sister, his will being overturned on his death since parliament considered a state funeral at Westminster Abbey more fitting. Wilberforce's son-in-law, the abolitionist lawyer James Stephen, was also a frequent visitor, as his father lived at the Fleetwood Summerhouse adjacent to Abney Park. Dr Thomas Binney, the \\\"Archbishop of Non-conformity\\\", has a portrait in the National Portrait Gallery that shows him at the Anti-Slavery Society Convention (with Josiah Conder); Binney is buried close to the Church Street entrance in Abney Park Cemetery. Christopher Newman Hall, who was influential on the side of slavery emancipation in the American Civil War, is buried here with his father. So is the Rev. James Sherman, who wrote the introduction to Harriet Beecher Stowe's hugely influential <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>. The novel was partly based on Josiah Henson, whose escape to freedom in Britain was assisted by the philanthropist Samuel Morley, who is buried in the cemetery. The Rev. Joseph Ketley, a Congregational missionary and abolitionist in Demerara, is also interred here, as is Rev. Dr John Morison, patron of the escaped slave and influential African-American autobiographer Moses Roper.</p>\\n\\n<p>Recently rediscovered is the grave of Olaudah Equiano's daughter Joanna Vassa, as he was a well-known former slave who worked for abolition. Jamaican emancipation is represented directly by the Rev. Samuel Oughton and the Rev. Thomas Burchell, who only narrowly escaped death at the hands of the planters; and their underlying Baptist support by Nathaniel Rogers M.D. A deacon at the Burchell Baptist church, the African Samuel Sharpe, became a Jamaican hero. Aaron Buzacott, the second Secretary of Anti-Slavery International, originally known as the Anti-Slavery Society, is buried here. At Abney Park Cemetery there are also some of the early settlers in Britain from the four corners of the world, such as the African, Thomas Caulker, the son of the King of Bompey (now Sierra Leone), who signed an anti-slavery agreement that became part of an Act of Parliament in the 1850s; and Leota, a native of the Samoa Islands whose life in London was due to the work of the London Missionary Society who sought to build schools and bring scripture to the inhabitants of the South Seas. Abney Park is one of the main burial places of 19th-century missionaries; here, for example is the burial place of William Ellis, John Williams' wife and son, Dr Walter Henry Medhurst, and Edward Stallybrass. Also Sarah Buzacott, the wife of Aaron Buzacott the elder, who was a teacher at the London Missionary Society college at Rarotonga in the South Seas. Many nonconformist divines are also buried here, for example Dr Alexander Fletcher, 'The Children's Friend'.</p>\\n<p>The evangelist Emily Gosse is buried in a simple grave near Dr Watts' Mound. Close to Church Street is the burial of one of the cemetery's early Director and Trustees, one of the first two members of parliament for Hackney Sir Charles Reed FSA. Close by lies his father Dr Andrew Reed (1788\\u20131862), a student of Rev. George Collison and founder of the London Orphan Asylum. In 1834, along with the Rev. J. Matheson, Andrew Reed was sent to the Congregational Churches of America by the Congregational Union of England and Wales as a deputation to promote peace and friendship between the two communities. He spent six months in America and during his stay there Yale University conferred upon him an honorary Doctorate of Divinity. This strengthened the Congregationalists' transatlantic links, ensuring the Rev George Collison's son a welcome when he visited to gain ideas for Abney Park cemetery's design from Mount Auburn Cemetery.</p>\\n<p>Here too is the Welsh MP Henry Richard, a mid-19th-century secretary of the Peace Society, instrumental in encouraging the first university in Wales at Aberystwyth along with its founder Sir Hugh Owen, whose own memorial is to the east of the Abney Park Cedar Circle. Also buried here is Betsi Cadwaladr, a Welsh nurse who worked in the Crimea with Florence Nightingale. The Peace Society is well represented at Abney Park; two of its other 19th-century secretaries, Rev. Nun Morgan Harry and Rev. John Jefferson are also buried here. Rajendra Chandra Chandra, Professor of Calcutta Medical College and physician, is also buried here with his wife.</p>\\n<p>Pioneering fire fighter James Braidwood, credited with forming the first municipal fire brigade; Edward Calvert, painter; engraver and painter and novelist Isabella Banks; newspaper editor and playwright George Linnaeus Banks; and the African-Jamaican Baptist missionary Rev. Joseph Jackson Fuller, are also buried in the Park. So too are Rev William Brock D.D., John Hoppus D.D. of University College London, and John Harris D.D. and Robert Halley of New College London.</p>\\n<p>Amongst the theatre and music hall performers resting at Abney Park are George Leybourne, Nelly Power, Albert Chevalier, G. W. Hunt, Herbert Campbell, Edmund Payne, Dan Crawley, Walter Laburnum and Fred Albert. These graves are cared for by the theatre charity The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America who undertake memorial restorations and provide free monthly guided walks. </p>\\n<p>Other burials at the cemetery include the Chartist leader and publisher James \\\"Bronterre\\\" O'Brien, whose life and work is celebrated at the cemetery each year, especially by the Irish community and those in the Labour Movement; Dr John Pye Smith, the first dissenter to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society; Mary Hays, the feminist writer and friend of Mary Wollstonecraft; Eric Walrond, the African-American Harlem Renaissance writer; and Thomas William Robertson the dramatic author. John O'Connor Power (1846\\u20131919), Irish Member of Parliament for Mayo, orator, barrister, radical journalist and author of <i>The Making of an Orator</i> is buried here with his wife's family. A Victoria Cross recipient from the Indian Mutiny, Private John Freeman, is buried here. World record holder in motor-paced cycling Tommy Hall.</p>\\n<p>In a different way, Susanna Bostock is remembered, largely due to the dominance of her life-sized marble lion alongside a path close to the chapel. Along with the Wombwells, the Bostocks were mainly responsible for bringing Asian and African animals to the attention of the Victorian public. For part of the year giraffes lived close to the cemetery at a small farm in Yoakley Road.</p>\\n<h2>First &amp; Second World Wars</h2>\\n\\n<p>Abney Park contains war graves to 371 Commonwealth service personnel who died in the two World Wars and which are registered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission: 258 from World War I and 113 from World War II. Unusually, Stoke Newington has two \\\"Cross of Sacrifice\\\" monuments constructed shortly after the end of WWI based on Blomfield's famous design: one on the lawn in front of St. Mary's Church on Church Street, and one in front of the south-facing facade of Abney Park Chapel in the cemetery. The names associated with the first cross are displayed a short distance away (inside the foyer of the public library on Church Street) whilst the names of those associated with the second cross (those who are interred in the cemetery but whose graves could not be given individual headstones) are recorded on a north-facing Screen Wall memorial added to the platform on which it stands. Near the cemetery cross, the names of Second World War servicemen who lost their lives and have been buried in the cemetery without separate commemoration, have also been displayed.</p>\\n<p>The cemetery's 'Cross of Sacrifice' serves as a landmark, but though rising on a ragstone platform of contrasting Portland Stone, it cannot be viewed on the approach from Church Street since the cemetery company chose to infill Dr Watts' axial walk at the time the war memorial was erected, so they designed the platform screen wall to prevent the cross from being seen from the south. The Trust hopes to change this if a redesign can be agreed, so as to display the cross to be seen from more directions and as a vantage point and focal point overlooking both directions of the original axis from the chapel spire and its ogee arch along Dr Watts' Walk, and on to Abney House gate; the axis that commemorates the life of the Rev. Dr Isaac Watts. Slightly off this exact axial alignment, is the small Blitz memorial that records civilian deaths, closer to the south entrance (picture right).</p>\\n<p>Though it suffered extensive property damage in the war, Stoke Newington's death toll was relatively low by the standards of some other Hackney districts like Shoreditch, and it would have been lower still, were it not for one incident on 13 October 1940, when a German bomb made a direct hit on a crowded shelter at Coronation Avenue, just off the high street. Most people in the shelter were killed, and as the illustration shows, the list of the dead from this one incident takes up nearly three of the four panels on the memorial. Many of the dead were Jewish and some were refugees from the Nazis.</p>\\n<p>Of two known unexploded WWII bombs remaining in Stoke Newington, one is located somewhere in Abney Park.</p>\\n<h2>'Sweet Auburn' &amp; woodland wildlife</h2>\\n<p>As may have been implied already, Abney Park Cemetery was the only garden cemetery of its era to be influenced by New World cemetery design ideas due to the strong links between its founders and New England; in particular Boston. The Stoke Newington cemetery reflects the design style adopted for Mount Auburn, for example in its use of an Egyptian Revival entrance and arboretum. However, though its \\\"model\\\" lay in the New World, it drew on different romantic landscape associations. Whereas Mount Auburn Cemetery celebrated the 'Sweet Auburn' of poetry, in particular the nature and woodland associated with the Auburn village area, it was the \\\"romance\\\" of religious and historical associations that primarily attracted the founders of London's first nondenominational garden cemetery, to Lady Mary Abney's estate which had served as an inspiration to the celebrated Isaac Watts. Nonetheless, on its opening, Abney Park was by far the most sylvan of all garden cemeteries in Britain; its many stately trees imbued the landscape with a uniquely well-timbered inheritance or \\\"green cloak\\\", and plans were put in train to encourage this further with collections of trees arranged along, and set back from, path edges. Whereas the cemetery at Mount Auburn had been blessed with a natural woodland setting, well suited to its founders' ethos of creating an Elysian paradise, Abney Park would take some time to more closely reflect its predominantly woodland style of cemetery design and a more transcendental view of nature as proposed by Emerson, and Thoreau in New England.</p>\\n\\n<p>Slowly, however, time has healed this difference and the landscape at Abney Park has grown closer to its New World cousin. Mature trees and woodland now adorn Abney Park, completing its transformation into a woodland cemetery. This has been so profound a change that by the early 1990s the cemetery was acknowledged to be the largest woodland ecosystem in North London so close to the centre of the City of London, and became designated as the first statutory Local Nature Reserve in the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>Under careful management the woodland is slowly becoming enriched through natural regeneration. The northern areas are slowly returning to native oaks with a hornbeam and hawthorn understory, and a woodland ground flora that includes Wood False Brome grass and Wood Spurge; the whole being interspersed with naturalising exotic thorns and service trees to add a cross-cultural dimension. Meanwhile, the sandy brickearth soils that extend from Church Street along Dr Watts' Walk to the chapel lawns, the sole surviving heathland in Hackney, are returning to a lighter structure based on Silver Birch woodland and healthy species such as bracken fern. Today, a range of woodland birds, mammals and butterflies are supported; the grounds forming one of north London's largest breeding sites so close to the City for some very attractive species such as the Speckled Wood butterfly.</p>\\n<p>Nature changes gradually however, and the ecology will need active habitat management if these semi-natural sylvan qualities are to be preserved and enhanced, and to ensure that the naturalising exotic arboretum trees (such as Various-leaved Hawthorn and Service Tree of Fontainebleau) and plans for the replacement of Loddiges' perimeter A to Z arboretum, contribute their valuable educational and botanical interest to parts of the grounds.</p>\\n<h2>Endpiece</h2>\\n<p>Part of a Victorian account of a visit to admire the beauties of Abney Park Cemetery reads:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<p>There is a beautiful cemetery in Stoke Newington, and it was given to the inhabitants in memory of Lady Abney, who was a sincere friend to Dr. Watts. There is in it a pretty little church, where funeral services are performed by all denominations of Christians.</p>\\n<p>Lady Abney was very liberal in her religious views, and the cemetery is, with its church, open to all alike, and though its grounds were never consecrated, yet many rigid churchmen have been buried in it. There is no quieter burial spot within a dozen miles of London in any direction, and there are cedars of Lebanon in it, wide lawns, and beautiful flowers.</p>\\n<p>There is an old clergyman in the church, who is always ready to officiate for a small fee on funeral occasions. He is over eighty years old, his hair is like the snow, and he is a fit companion to such a solemn place.</p>\\n<p>One shining evening, with a female friend we visited the cemetery, and stopped in the little [largely] Gothic chapel to talk with the venerable clergyman. The tears actually sprung over his eyelids when we said that we came from America.</p>\\n<p>The old man asked a thousand questions about the wonderful far land of liberty in the west, which we were glad to answer. Almost every family among the poor respectable classes in England, has some member, or relation in America.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Gallery</h2>\\n<p>Abney Park Cemetery is one of the Magnificent Seven.

He was educated at Northampton under the Rev. John Ryland, and, after serving an apprenticeship with William Otridge, commenced business as a general bookseller on 19 April 1794 in the Strand, where he remained until 1816.</p>\\n<h2>Printing the Bible</h2>\\n<h3>The idea</h3>\\n<p>A few years before he left, the rarity and consequent costliness of all polyglot bibles gave him the idea of supplying the want of a handy and inexpensive edition. He first brought out a Hebrew Bible, which was followed by the Septuagint, both in foolscap octavo. The production of English bibles was a monopoly in the United Kingdom, confined in England to the king's printer and the two great universities, in Scotland to Sir D. H. Blair and John Bruce, and in Ireland to Mr. Grierson. It had been decided, however, that the patent did not apply to bibles printed with notes.</p>\\n<h3>Bagster's polyglot bible</h3>\\n<p>Bagster brought out in 1816 \\u2018The English version of the polyglot bible\\u2019 (with a preface by T. Chevalier), in foolscap octavo size, containing a selection of over 60,000 parallel references, mainly selected and all verified by himself. The book was extremely successful. Every detail in its production was superintended by the publisher, who introduced a new style of binding in the best Turkey Morocco, with flexible tight backs, the sheets being sewed with thin thread or silk. He also used prepared sealskins, which, with their \\u2018pin-head grain,\\u2019 were much admired.</p>\\n<h3>Move and other printing</h3>\\n<p>In 1816 he moved to 15 Paternoster Row. The first issue of the \\u2018Biblia Sacra Polyglotta Bagsteriana\\u2019 appeared between 1817 and 1828, four volumes in foolscap octavo and quarto form, containing, besides the prolegomena of Dr. Samuel Lee, the Hebrew Old Testament with points, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Septuagint Greek version of the Old Testament, the Latin Vulgate, the authorised English version, the Greek Textus Receptus of the New Testament, and the Peshito or ancient Syriac version. An edition was printed of a quarto French, Italian, Spanish, and German Bible, which Lowndes states was entirely destroyed by fire on the premises in March 1822, when only twenty-three copies of the New Testament portion were preserved. A folio edition of the polyglot was published in 1828, repeated in 1831, and subsequently, presenting eight languages at the opening of the volume, and including all the ancient and modern versions above mentioned. Copies of the different texts and translations were brought out separately, and in various combinations. Although best known for publishing religious works, other books were sometimes issued, including 'A Synoptical Compend of British Botany, Arranged After the Linnean System' by John Galpine.</p>\\n<h3>Regulation reform</h3>\\n<p>In consequence of the arbitrary regulations of the excise authorities, paper could only be had of certain sizes. It was partially owing to Bagster's exertions that the rules were modified. Two other forms of the English bible were issued, and, all of them harmonising page for page, began what is known as the \\u2018Facsimile Series.\\u2019 The publication of the first volume of the polyglot was followed in 1821 by an octoglot edition of the liturgy of the Church of England in a handsome quarto. The eight languages were English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, ancient Greek, modern Greek, and Latin.</p>\\n<h3>William Greenfield</h3>\\n<p>In 1822 Bagster made the acquaintance of the self-taught Orientalist, William Greenfield, of whose life he wrote an interesting account in the \\u2018Imperial Magazine\\u2019 (1834, pp.\\u00a09, 63). Greenfield had suggested a lexicon to the polyglot edition of the Hebrew Bible, which caused him to be engaged as a proof-reader to the various learned publications Bagster was then bringing out. In 1824 Bagster circulated the prospectus of a polyglot grammar in twenty or thirty languages upon the principles of comparative philology, also the suggestion of Greenfield, who in 1827 edited for the publisher his \\u2018Comprehensive Bible,\\u2019 with 4,000 illustrative notes, 500,000 marginal references, a general introduction, and a variety of other useful information. Bagster's Syriac New Testament (1828\\u201329) Hebrew New Testament (1830), Polymicrian Greek Lexicon (1829), Schmidt's Greek Concordance (1829), and, in fact, all the small and beautifully printed Polymicrian series, were also edited by Greenfield.</p>\\n<h3>Later Printing</h3>\\n<p>Many books were subsequently printed by Bagster. A fine quarto issued in 1841 is specially deserving of mention. It is \\u2018The English Hexapla,\\u2019 giving the six most important versions in our tongue of the New Testament, being those of Wyclif (1380), Tyndale (1534), Cranmer (1539), the Genevan (1557), the Anglo-Rhemish (1582), and the authorised (1611), together with the Greek text after Scholz, and a valuable historical account of the English translations. Another noteworthy publication was the \\u2018Bible of every land,\\u2019 4to, supplying specimens of over 270 different languages and versions.</p>\\n<h2>Firm Motto</h2>\\n<p>The well-known motto of the firm, \\u03c0\\u03bf\\u03bb\\u03bb\\u03b1\\u1f76 \\u03bc\\u1f72\\u03bd \\u03b8\\u03bd\\u03b7\\u03c4\\u03bf\\u1fd6\\u03c2 \\u03b3\\u03bb\\u1ff6\\u03c4\\u03c4\\u03b1\\u03b9, \\u03bc\\u03af\\u03b1 \\u03b4'\\u1f00\\u03b8\\u03b1\\u03bd\\u03ac\\u03c4\\u03bf\\u03b9\\u03c3\\u03b9\\u03bd, is said to have been due to the Rev. H. F. Cary (Notes and Queries, ser. i. v. 587). We are informed by a member of the family that the Latin version, mult\\u00e6 terricolis lingu\\u00e6, c\\u0153lestibus una, was by William Greenfield. As the two versions appear on Greenfield's tomb, it is very probable that they were both by him.</p>\\n<h2>Personal life</h2>\\n<p>Bagster married on 19 December 1797 Miss Eunice Birch, who survived him twenty-six years, dying on the eve of her 99th birthday. He died at his residence in Old Windsor on 28 March 1851, aged 78 and is commemorated with a large ledger slab memorial at Abney Park Cemetery. Eunice is interred with Samuel and their eldest son Samuel Bagster the Younger (1800-1835) who printed many of the firm's publications. Due to Samuel the younger's early death, his brother Jonathan (1813\\u20131872) succeeded the elder Samuel as senior member of the firm.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q7410851\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":8003056,\"title\":\"Samuel Oughton\",\"text\":\"<p>The <b>Rev. Samuel Oughton</b> (1803 \\u2013 December 1881), Baptist missionary to Jamaica 1836-1866, and colleague of William Knibb, was an ardent slavery abolitionist who became an outspoken advocate of black labour rights in Jamaica during the gradual abolition of slavery in the late 1830s and thereafter. He was briefly imprisoned in Jamaica during 1840. Originally associated with James Sherman's Independent Congregational Surrey Chapel, and from time to time invited back by Sherman, he was closely associated with the Baptists in Jamaica, who were largely organised along Congregational lines and among the predominantly African-Caribbean population, following their founding by George Lisle, a former slave from America.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life in Jamaica</h2>\\n<p>Samuel Oughton's work for the Baptist Missionary Society in Jamaica, soon became well known. Arriving in 1836 from the Surrey Chapel in London, his posting was initially to help Thomas Burchell, a relative by marriage. However, by 1839 he was invited by the largely African congregation in Kingston to be their pastor at the prominent East Queen Street chapel.</p>\\n<p>This was a key time in the emancipation of Jamaican slaves. After \\\"legal abolition\\\" began in Jamaica with the home government's Emancipation Act of 1833, conditions were little better for many Africans in Jamaica for some decades; particularly under the dreaded \\\"indentured apprenticeship\\\" system of forced labour, which was taken to extremes by the Planters, some masters and their overseers compelling the use of treadmills.</p>\\n<p>The abuses of indentured apprenticeship were finally abolished on 1 August 1838, following a campaign led by Joseph Sturge, with support from the Baptists, the Anti-Slavery Society, and longstanding abolitionists such as William Allen. Even so, emancipation was no paradise; the planters frequently harassed tenants (see Free Villages, and sought to drive down wages when they could. Oughton once famously remarked to his flock in the parish of Hanover:</p>\\n<p>For a time (during 1840) he was imprisoned by the Jamaican authorities for his outspoken views against liberties being taken by magistrates against African women. Back in Britain, Joseph Sturge of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society passed on Oughton's descriptions of the horrendous labour practices suffered by Africans in Jamaica, which Oughton continued to communicate whilst in prison. Joseph Sturge made representations to the Colonial Office on his behalf and Samuel Oughton was eventually discharged after a period released on bail. He records \\\"simple but ardent expressions of delight and affection\\\" from \\\"our poor dear people\\\", who welcomed him back to East Queen Street chapel with renewed hope. In 1841 Oughton was able to write: \\\"my affection for the people, and theirs for me, seems to grow stronger by the day\\\".</p>\\n<p>The Baptist returns at about this date show Samuel Oughton, assisted by George Rowse, to be responsible for three \\\"sub stations\\\", two \\\"day schools\\\", two \\\"Sunday schools\\\", and, besides Rowse, two further teachers - Miss Simpson, and W.Spraggs.</p>\\n<h2>Oughton's moral code</h2>\\n<p>In the 1844 elections Oughton was active in promoting African candidates, and most of his congregation were of African origin. He stayed at East Queen Street chapel as pastor for the next twenty years, although not without incident since he promoted a form of moral code that he applied to everyone, including the emancipated citizens whose status he had been invited to improve.</p>\\n<p>The legal status of one Baptist chapel was often slightly different from another since they had grown up in many ways. At one time George Lisle's chapel was his personal responsibility, and he was imprisoned for an outstanding debt on its construction. The more appropriate scheme of ownership was through some form of trust deed. Whilst Oughton supported the congregation's right to appoint trustees at one Chapel where this issue arose, the wish of his own congregation to do likewise at the East Queen Street Chapel became a cause of controversy since it had a different constitution. Oughton also faced a problem because all its trustees but one had died before dutifully appointing others, and so it became inquorate. Just as he had exposed wrongdoing by the magistrates, and been prepared to suffer imprisonment for a time, he would not be party to illegal ownership arrangements at his chapel whatever the price. A number of his congregation would have been happy with this however, and put pressure on the remaining trustee to exceed his legal authority. Oughton's firm moral standards upset them; he again had to pay the price of unpopularity, just as when he had upset sections of the white population earlier.</p>\\n<p>In the 1860s Oughton departed from religion and education slightly, though in his inimitable moralistic way. He wrote two books in which he tried to promote a theory, originally popular with some French and English thinkers in \\\"The Enlightenment\\\" period, that a population must 'want' artificial things to create drive and hard work, and therefore increasing wealth. In such a seductively warm and fertile island as Jamaica, Oughton contended, this might not happen; people might content themselves after reaching a certain standard of living.</p>\\n<h2>The Jamaican Baptists and emancipation</h2>\\n<p>The Baptist missions on Jamaica were closely involved in emancipation and reform. The mission was founded by the African George Lisle a former slave from America. Their churches on Jamaica promoted the slave Samuel Sharpe (1801\\u201332) to Deacon at the Burchell Baptist Church in Montego Bay, and later the African Paul Bogle (1822\\u20131865), believed to have been born free, to Deacon in Stony Gut, north of Morant Bay.</p>\\n<p>There was progress, too in encouraging political and social involvement of women. Positions of responsibility such as \\\"assistant class leader\\\", \\\"class leader\\\", and above, were open to all who had the necessary reading and writing skills; men and women. One of the Baptist's cherished principles was of church self-government in which everyone was entitled to vote in elections and petitioning, which provided the first opportunity for many in the community to have their voice heard. This was one of the earliest routes through which the labouring poor began to have political influence. Progress was sometimes painfully slow, however, particularly for those who sought immediate self-government. At Samuel Oughton's chapel, Eleanor Vickars, an African assistant class-leader whose father is believed to have been a deacon, successfully stood for election as class-leader but did not meet the literacy requirement necessary for confirmation of her appointment. Samuel Oughton had to decide between the Baptist's cherished principles of self-government or upholding the literacy entry requirements arising from the hope that education would be \\\"the great leveller\\\". In the event, he avoided setting a precedent and called for both beliefs to be upheld equally, a route that did successfully lead to self-determination by African congregations.</p>\\n<p>It has been noted that female literacy was strongly encouraged by the Baptist Missionary Society. In 1841 the <i>Baptist Herald and Friend of Africa</i> was able to report thirty-six female teachers and over 2,000 girls in day schools. Back in Britain a training school for female teachers was also established; at Kettering.</p>\\n<h2>Burial</h2>\\n<p>Samuel Oughton's second wife, Sarah (1819\\u20131882), was sister of the wealthy British doctor and baptist, Nathaniel Rogers MD. Samuel Oughton died in London in December 1881 and is buried along with Sarah, each with a memorial plaque, in the Rogers' Family Mausoleum at Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington. Samuel's first wife was Hannah, a niece of Hester Burchell, who was the wife of Thomas Burchell.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Nathaniel_Rogers_MD.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q7412322\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":25436004,\"title\":\"Robert Brown (musician)\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Robert Brown</b> (AKA \\\"Captain Robert\\\") is an American multi-instrumentalist.

It is a 13ha (32 acre) park dating from just before 1700, named after Lady Mary Abney and associated with Dr Isaac Watts. In the early 18th century, the park was accessed via the frontages and gardens of two large mansions \\u2014 her own manor house (Abney House), and the neighbouring Fleetwood House. Both mansions fronted onto Church Street in what was then a quiet Nonconformist village.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Parkland</h2>\\n<p>In the early 18th century, Lady Mary Abney laid out Abney Park after inheriting the Manor of Stoke Newington in 1701 from her brother Thomas Gunston. Initially she and her husband Sir Thomas Abney lived there part-time, also living at his residence in Hertfordshire. She began work on the park in those years.</p>\\n<p>After her husband's death in 1722, Lady Mary moved to Abney House full-time, becoming the first Lady of the Manor of Stoke Newington in her own right. She was said to be helped in designing the landscaping of the grounds as an English garden by the learned Dr Isaac Watts, who had been a long-term house guest of her and her late husband, and continued to live in her household. The neighbouring Hartopp family of Fleetwood House, who leased the eastern part of the park to Lady Mary, also helped with the park.</p>\\n<p>Her improvements included planting of the Great Elm Walk and Little Elm Walk, which established shady walkways down to the island heronry of the Hackney Brook at the bottom of the park. Both Wych Elm and English Elm were planted. The Hartopp family had already completed one of the early plantings of a Cedar of Lebanon tree in Great Britain, adjacent to an ornamental pond. This tree survived into the 1920s and is illustrated in many engravings of the period.</p>\\n<p>Other trees planted at an early date at Abney Park (either in the portion leased by Fleetwood House, or that attached solely to Abney House) included American Larch and Tulip Trees from the New World. The Nonconformists of Stoke Newington had strong connections to colonists in New England.</p>\\n<h2>Abney House</h2>\\n<p>Abney Park was dominated by Abney House. For some time in the early decades of the 19th century, it was the residence of James William Freshfield and his family.</p>\\n<p>In its final years, it was adapted for use as a Wesleyan Methodist training college or seminary (c.1838/9-1843). Rev. John Farrar was the governor of the college. He was elected Secretary of the Methodist Conference on fourteen occasions and twice its President. When the Methodists moved into their first purpose-built college at Richmond, south of London in 1843, Farrar was appointed as the Classical Tutor. He worked there until 1857.</p>\\n<p>After 1843, Abney House was 'recycled' (broken up for sale as building materials) for the building trade of the rapidly expanding metropolis, as was common in the Victorian era.</p>\\n<h2>Fleetwood House</h2>\\n<p>Fleetwood House was built in the 1630s for Sir Edward Hartopp. By marriage the estate passed to Charles Fleetwood, one of Oliver Cromwell's generals, and was named for him. It was later owned by various parties. from whom it got its name, and then through various parties. It served as a meeting place for Dissenters and Nonconformists, for which residents Stoke Newington was known.</p>\\n<p>In the grounds was a third building, called the Summerhouse. From 1774, it was used as a summer residence by the family of young James Stephen (1758-1832). Although not a Quaker, he became closely with the abolitionist cause, which they supported. In 1800, he married a sister of his friend William Wilberforce, who visited Stoke Newington regularly. Between them, the two men drafted the Slave Trade Act 1807, to prohibit the international slave trade originating in Africa.</p>\\n<p>In 1824, Fleetwood House was adapted for use as a new Quaker school, known as Newington Academy for Girls (also Newington College for Girls). In a time when girls' educational opportunities were limited, it offered a wide range of subjects (including sciences) \\\"on a plan in degree differing from any hitherto adopted\\\", according to the prospectus. It commissioned the world's first school bus, designed by George Shillibeer.</p>\\n<p>One of the school's founders was William Allen, a Quaker active with the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade.

He has also worked extensively in production and as a session musician, as a technology entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, and as the Music Director for the TED Conference. He is currently a Professor of the Arts at Johns Hopkins University.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Personal life</h2>\\n<p>Robertson was born in London, England, contrary to information in early 1980s press releases that reported his birthplace as Cairo, Egypt. His father, Martin Robertson, was an internationally distinguished professor of classical Greek art and archaeology at the University of London, Oxford University, and Cambridge University (Trinity College.) In his youth Thomas lived or worked in France, Italy and Greece. He attended Abingdon School in 1975\\u20131976, completing his A Levels while there. Thomas Dolby spoke of his early musical experiences in a 2012 interview:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<p>\\\"I sang in a choir when I was 10 or 11, and learned to sightread single lines, but other than that I don't have a formal education. I picked up the guitar initially, playing folk tunes \\u2013 Dylan \\u2013 then I graduated to piano when I got interested in jazz, listening to people like Oscar Peterson, Dave Brubeck, Bill Evans, Thelonious Monk, and so on. The first electronic instruments started to become accessible in the mid-70s and I got my hands on a kit built synthesizer and never looked back.\\\"</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>He married actress Kathleen Beller in 1988; they have three children together.</p>\\n<p>Dolby is member No.\\u00a000001 of the current incarnation of the Flat Earth Society.</p>\\n<h2>Stage name</h2>\\n<p>The Thomas Dolby stage name originated from a nickname that he picked up around the early 1970s, when he was \\\"always messing around with keyboards and tapes\\\". His friends nicknamed him <b>Dolby</b>, from the name of an audio noise-reduction process from Dolby Laboratories used for audio recording and playback. British singer Tom Robinson was popular when Dolby began his career, and Robertson chose to adopt the stage name \\\"Thomas Dolby\\\" to avoid confusion. Early publicity implied that \\\"Dolby\\\" was a middle name, and that the artist's full name was Thomas Morgan Dolby Robertson; this is legally incorrect, but he does sometimes informally go by the initials TMDR.</p>\\n<p>After the release of \\\"She Blinded Me With Science\\\", Dolby Laboratories expressed concern regarding the musician's stage name. Dolby's record label refused to make him change his name, and Dolby Labs did not raise the issue again until later. After a lengthy legal battle, the court decided that Dolby Labs had no right to restrict the musician from using the name. It was agreed that the musician would not release any electronic equipment using the name. (Coincidentally, inventor/founder Dr. Ray Dolby had a son named Thomas, now a novelist professionally known as Tom Dolby.)</p>\\n<h2>Solo music career</h2>\\n<p>Dolby is associated with the new wave movement of the early 1980s, a form of pop music incorporating electronic instruments, but Dolby's work covers a wide range of musical styles and moods distinct from the high-energy pop sound of his few, better-known commercial successes.</p>\\n<h3><i>The Golden Age of Wireless</i></h3>\\n\\n<p>Originally released in the UK and US including the songs \\\"Europa and the Pirate Twins\\\", \\\"Airwaves\\\", and \\\"Radio Silence\\\", the first releases of Dolby's first solo album, <i>The Golden Age of Wireless</i> (Harvest, 1982) did not include the album's signature hit, \\\"She Blinded Me With Science\\\". After the five-song EP \\\"Blinded by Science\\\" introduced the catchy single, \\\"The Golden Age of Wireless\\\", was subsequently re-released with the single that, combined with its accompanying video, became Dolby's most commercially successful single, reaching No.\\u00a05 on The Billboard Hot 100. The album was released a total of five times, each with changes in song order and included songs, or even including a different version of \\\"Radio Silence\\\" or extended remix of \\\"She Blinded Me With Science\\\".</p>\\n<p>Dolby's debut album, <i>Wireless</i> peaked at No.\\u00a013 on the Billboard Album Chart. It juxtaposed themes of radio technology, aircraft, and naval submarines with those of relationships and nostalgia. While much of the album's instrumentation is synthesizers and samplers, the album credits a long list of guest musicians as well, with instruments ranging from harmonica and violin to guitar and percussion.</p>\\n<p>\\\"She Blinded Me with Science\\\" included sound samples from Dr.\\u00a0Magnus Pyke. The song reached No.\\u00a05 on the US Hot 100. A short sample was included in the \\\"Treehouse of Horror XIV\\\" episode of <i>The Simpsons</i>, where Professor Frink was winning an award at a science convention. It was also sampled at a lower speed by the group Mobb Deep in the 2006 song \\\"Got it Twisted\\\". \\\"She Blinded Me With Science\\\" was also used as the theme song for the pilot episode of broadcast television sitcom <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> though it was not used for later episodes (it was, however, later used in that show as Howard's cell phone ringtone in the season 2 episode \\\"The Vegas Renormalization\\\" and season 3 episode \\\"The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary\\\").</p>\\n<h3>Dolby's Cube</h3>\\n<p>Beginning in 1983, Dolby collaborated with a number of artists in an occasional studio-bound project called Dolby's Cube. The project had no set line-up, and was essentially a forum for Dolby to release material that was more dance-oriented. Dolby's Cube released a single in 1983 (\\\"Get Out of My Mix\\\"), another in 1985 (\\\"May The Cube Be With You\\\"), and performed soundtrack work for the film \\\"Howard The Duck\\\" in 1986. Collaborators in Dolby's Cube at various junctures included Lene Lovich, George Clinton of Parliament-Funkadelic, Francois Kevorkian, and Lea Thompson.</p>\\n<h3><i>The Flat Earth</i></h3>\\n<p>In 1984, Dolby released his second LP, <i>The Flat Earth</i> (Capitol), which peaked at No.\\u00a014 on the UK Albums Chart and at No.\\u00a035 on the <i>Billboard</i> Album Chart in the US. Utilizing a wide range of influences ranging from nostalgic Jazz, funk-tinged Motown R&amp;B, and World Music, along with a strong electronic element and featuring a slew of guest musicians, including longtime Dolby collaborator Matthew Seligman on bass, Kevin Armstrong on guitar, and Cliff Brigden on percussion, and guest vocals from Robyn Hitchcock, Bruce Woolley and others, <i>The Flat Earth</i> further established Dolby's wide range of talents as musician, songwriter, and producer. The album also included a cover of the Dan Hicks song \\\"I Scare Myself\\\".</p>\\n<p>\\\"Hyperactive!\\\", originally written for Michael Jackson, was the first and most successful single from the album, peaking at No.\\u00a017 on the UK Singles Chart, making it Dolby's highest-charting single in his home country.</p>\\n<h3><i>Aliens Ate My Buick</i></h3>\\n<p>In contrast to the overall introverted nature of <i>The Flat Earth</i>, Dolby's described his next release, <i>Aliens Ate My Buick</i> (1988) in the following quote: \\\"I think it's very bold. Some people who've known my stuff from the beginning find it a bit hard to stomach. They think it's a bit brash. It's certainly unsubtle in a lot of ways. It goes for the jugular. There was always a side to the stuff that I did that was very extroverted and wacky. The flip side of the coin was the more atmospheric, moody stuff. There was always room for both of them. But this album, with the exception of maybe one song [\\\"Budapest by Blimp\\\"], is all on the extrovert side.\\\"</p>\\n<p><i>Aliens Ate My Buick</i> was strongly funk and dance influenced. The first single was \\\"Airhead\\\", a satirical song about a stereotypical young-and-rich Californian woman, which peaked at No.\\u00a053. The second single, \\\"Hot Sauce\\\", a cover of a George Clinton song, peaked at No.\\u00a080. There was one more single, \\\"My Brain Is Like A Sieve\\\", which peaked at No.\\u00a089 on the UK Singles Chart. The album was co-produced by Bill Bottrell, and featured Terry Jackson on bass guitar.</p>\\n<h3><i>Astronauts And Heretics</i></h3>\\n<p>For <i>Astronauts &amp; Heretics</i> (Virgin UK), Dolby expanded even further stylistically, starting the songwriting process at the piano, then again collaborating with a variety of guest musicians. Both Bob Weir and Jerry Garcia played guitar on \\\"The Beauty of a Dream\\\". Eddie Van Halen plays on \\\"Eastern Bloc\\\" and \\\"Close But No Cigar\\\". Other collaborators included Jimmy Z on sax, Budgie on drums and Leland Sklar on bass guitar. Terry Jackson also contributed bass guitar on four songs before his 1991 death in a plane accident with seven other members of Reba McEntire's support band for her \\\"For My Broken Heart\\\" tour.</p>\\n<p>The highest-charting song off this album was \\\"Close But No Cigar\\\", which reached No.\\u00a022 on the UK charts.</p>\\n<p>Two other songs on the album, \\\"I Love You Goodbye\\\", and \\\"Silk Pyjamas\\\" employed Zydeco-influences, courtesy of Crowley, Louisiana and guest musicians Michael Doucet of BeauSoleil on violin, Wayne Toups on accordion, and even banjo. Even though some recording for the album was done in remote locations, the bulk of <i>Astronauts And Heretics</i> was recorded at NRG Recording Studios with input from trusted Dolby co-producer Bill Bottrell, and mixed down at Smoke Tree Studios in Chatsworth, California.</p>\\n<h3>The Sole Inhabitant</h3>\\n\\n<p>Following his involvement in Beatnik Inc, Dolby returned to his musical career in 2006. He performed his first solo public show in 15 years at the Red Devil Lounge in San Francisco, California on 21 January 2006, surprising the crowd who were there to see local band Notorious. He then launched an American tour, the Sole Inhabitant Tour, on 12 April, comprising a string of small dates in California, a mall opening in Boulder, Colorado, and gigs across America before receptive crowds.</p>\\n<p>The United States leg of the \\\"Sole Inhabitant Tour 2006\\\" was captured on a \\\"live\\\" CD and DVD. The CD represents a recording of two gigs played by Dolby at Martyrs in Chicago, while the DVD was filmed at the Berklee Performance Center at Berklee College of Music. The DVD also includes a 30-minute interview, and a lecture by Dolby at the Berklee College of Music. Both the CD and DVD were released in November 2006, and are distributed through CD Baby and iTunes. Dolby autographed and numbered the first 1,000 copies of the CD and DVD.</p>\\n<p>A show at the 800 capacity Scala club in London was booked for 3 July 2006 as a warm-up for Dolby's Hyde Park set opening for Depeche Mode. The show sold out in a matter of days and prompted Dolby to reprioritise the UK, resulting in him moving with his family from California back to England, and a nine-date Sole Inhabitant tour of the UK in October 2007, coinciding with the release of a lavish box set of the Sole Inhabitant CD and DVD by UK independent label Invisible Hands Music.</p>\\n<p>Thomas toured throughout the months of November and December 2006 with electronic musician BT. This tour included a version of \\\"Airwaves\\\" that BT added his own technique to, which was the opening song on the UK leg of the Sole Inhabitant tour (<i>sans</i> BT).</p>\\n<p>Thomas Dolby's performance of 15 March 2007 at the SxSW festival was released as the live EP \\\"Thomas Dolby &amp; The Jazz Mafia Horns, Live at SxSW\\\" (with musicians from San Francisco's Jazz Mafia collective, through iTunes and on CD Baby.)</p>\\n<p>The 2007 UK Sole Inhabitant tour included three new songs previously played on the US tour, one called \\\"Your Karma Hit My Dogma\\\" another called \\\"Jealous Thing\\\" and a cover version of The Special AKA's \\\"What I Like Most About You Is Your Girlfriend\\\". \\\"Your Karma Hit My Dogma\\\" was inspired by Kevin Federline's unauthorised use of a sample from Mobb Deep's \\\"Got It Twisted\\\" which in turn had used an authorised sample of \\\"She Blinded Me with Science\\\". The tag-line from that story became the title of the song. The wording was lifted by Thomas from a bumper sticker on a car that he saw whilst living in the San Francisco Bay area. In a move close to performance art, Dolby tried to post a 'cease and desist' legal letter on Kevin Federline's MySpace page when other attempts to contact him proved fruitless. The song is on the <i>Live at SxSW</i> EP.</p>\\n<p>The second new song, \\\"Jealous Thing\\\" was performed at least at The Graduate in Cambridge and London's Islington Academy on the UK tour in Summer 2007 and features a Bossa-Nova type rhythm.</p>\\n<h3>2009 re-issues</h3>\\n<p>A CD + DVD set entitled <i>The Singular Thomas Dolby</i> has been released by EMI on 18 May 2009. As the name suggests it is a digitally remastered compilation of previously released singles. The DVD contains all the video singles which were available on the original VHS/BETA/LASERDISC release of <i>The Golden Age of Video</i>, as well as the videos for the songs \\\"Silk Pyjamas\\\", \\\"I Love You Goodbye\\\", and \\\"Close But No Cigar\\\". These three missing videos are for the singles taken from the 1992 album <i>Astronauts &amp; Heretics</i>, which received critical acclaim but garnered unimpressive sales.</p>\\n<p><i>The Golden Age of Wireless</i> and <i>The Flat Earth</i> were reissued and remastered later that year with numerous previously unreleased bonus tracks. The former was a two disc set including a DVD of the complete \\\"Live Wireless\\\" video.</p>\\n<h3><i>A Map of the Floating City</i></h3>\\n<p>In 2010 Dolby began work on a new studio album entitled <i>A Map of the Floating City</i>. The album is divided into three parts, with the first two parts initially made available to members of The Flat Earth Society, Dolby's online community. Each of the three digital EPs takes its name from one of the three sections of the full-length album that later followed. The first EP, <i>Amerikana</i>, was released digitally on 16 June 2010. The second EP is entitled <i>Oceanea</i>, and was released on 29 November 2010. Due to favourable reviews and radio airplay, <i>Oceanea</i> was released commercially on 28 March 2011. The third section of the album, entitled <i>Urbanoia</i>, was not released as a download or physical CD, but the songs were premiered online as part of the Floating City game (see below).</p>\\n<p>Contributors to the album include Kevin Armstrong, Matthew Seligman (both had played together with him on <i>The Flat Earth</i> and as part of David Bowie's Live Aid appearance), Bruce Woolley, drummer Liam Genockey, guitarist Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits, Regina Spektor, Natalie MacMaster, Eddi Reader, and Imogen Heap.</p>\\n<p>In a 2010 press release he was quoted as saying:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<p>\\\"I marvel at the new landscape of the music business\\u00a0\\u2013 distribution via the Internet and recording technologies I barely dreamed of when I started out,\\\" he continues. \\\"But this album does not sound electronic at all. I have zero desire to add to the myriad of machine-based, synth-driven grooves out there. The Net has made a music career approachable for thousands of bands\\u00a0\\u2013 but I hear too few single-minded voices among them. What I do best is write songs, tell stories.\\\"</p>\\n<p>\\\"The new songs are organic and very personal,\\\" says Dolby. \\\"This album is a travelogue across three imaginary continents. In Amerikana I'm reflecting with affection on the years I spent living in the USA, and my fascination with its roots music. Urbanoia is a dark place, a little unsettling\\u00a0... I'm not a city person. And in Oceanea I return to my natural home on the windswept coastline.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><i>A Map of the Floating City</i> was recorded in the \\\"Nutmeg of Consolation\\\", Dolby's recording studio built within a 1930s lifeboat and powered entirely by renewable energy, which is located in the garden of Dolby's beach house on England's North Sea coast.</p>\\n<h3>Map of the Floating City game</h3>\\n<p>In June 2011 Dolby announced the <i>Map of the Floating City</i> game, a multiplayer online game that shares a title with the full-length album release planned to follow after the game's conclusion. In Dolby's own words, \\\"The Floating City is set against a dystopian vision of the 1940s that might have existed had WWII turned out a lot differently.\\\" Survivors explore a fictional Google map, forming tribes and trading relics amidst a bizarre sea-going barter society. As they struggle to unravel the enigma that is The Floating City, players can haggle over merchandise and music downloads \\u2013 including brand new songs from <i>A Map of the Floating City</i>, Dolby's first album in 20 years, scheduled to be released following the climax of the game. The game was played from June through August 2011, and included elements of trading, mystery, competition, and co-operation. Players earned free song downloads, and the winning team or \\\"tribe\\\" was awarded a private performance from Dolby.</p>\\n<h2>Studio and live performance collaborations</h2>\\n<h3>Professional music career beginnings</h3>\\n<p>Early in his career, Dolby played keyboards with Bruce Woolley and the Camera Club and is credited on their debut album. The instrumental track \\\"WW9\\\" in the album 'English Garden' is the first recorded example of Thomas' writing. He also wrote Lene Lovich's hit single \\\"New Toy\\\" and played keyboard as part of the backing band for her tour. Dolby played some synthesizer parts on the Thompson Twins album <i>Set</i> and co-wrote \\\"Magic's Wand\\\" with Whodini, and played keyboards on one track (\\\"Love\\\") on Robyn Hitchcock's first solo album, 1981's <i>Black Snake Diamond Role</i>. Around this time, he also formed a short-lived band called The Fallout Club.</p>\\n<p>By far the most significant session relationship for Thomas in the early days was when he contributed the signature synthesizer sound on the track \\\"Urgent\\\" on Foreigner's 1981 album <i>4</i>. On the same album he played the atmospheric synthesizer intro to the mega-hit \\\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\\\". The fees from this work, including tour dates, bankrolled the studio time for the recording of the 1980s benchmark album <i>The Golden Age of Wireless</i> from which his solo career began.</p>\\n<p>Dolby also worked as session keyboard player on Def Leppard's 1983 <i>Pyromania</i> album. Dolby appeared on <i>Pyromania</i> using the alias Booker T. Boffin, as his affiliation to another record label restricted the use of his real name.</p>\\n<h3>1985 Grammy Awards and Live Aid</h3>\\n<p>In 1985, Dolby appeared at the Grammy Awards, which were televised, along with Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock, and Howard Jones. All four musicians were successful in the mid-1980s music scene, and they were also all keyboard and synthesizer experts. That same year, Dolby performed at the Live Aid concert in London as part of David Bowie's band.</p>\\n<h3>Other live appearances</h3>\\n<p>In a 1985 news clip about synthesised music Dolby was shown (along with the industrial musician, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails fame) with Trent's early band, The \\\"Exotic Birds\\\".</p>\\n<p>He also appeared onstage playing keyboards with George Clinton &amp; Parliament-Funkadelic during the band's lone appearance on NBC's Saturday Night Live in 1986.</p>\\n<p>Dolby continued to perform live in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including an appearance supporting Depeche Mode at their 18 June 1988 Pasadena Rose Bowl concert which was released as the 101 concert album and movie.</p>\\n<p>In 1990 he appeared in Roger Waters' charity performance of Pink Floyd's <i>The Wall</i> album in Berlin. Dolby, in costume as the Teacher played a keyboard solo during \\\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\\\" (sung by Cyndi Lauper) and then reprised the role for the closing \\\"The Trial\\\" sequence.</p>\\n<p>He appeared on-stage with the reunited Soft Boys in San Francisco on 7 April 2001 and played synthesizer on \\\"You'll Have To Go Sideways\\\", \\\"Evil Guy\\\" and Pink Floyd's \\\"Astronomy Domine\\\". \\\"Evil Guy\\\", from that evening's sound-check, wound up on the Soft Boys' 2002 EP <i>Side Three</i>. It was not the first time Dolby and members of the Soft Boys appeared on record together. Dolby had played keyboards on former Soft Boys member Robyn Hitchcock's first solo album, <i>Black Snake Diamond Role</i>. Meanwhile Hitchcock appeared on Dolby's <i>The Flat Earth</i>, performing the role of Keith on \\\"White City\\\". Soft Boys bassist Matthew Seligman recorded and toured with Dolby in the 1980s, including the Live Aid performance.</p>\\n<p>Dolby also performed a portion of \\\"The Sole Inhabitant\\\" show for the Bob Moog Foundation Moogfest 2007 in New York City.</p>\\n<p>In 2012, Dolby headlined the first \\\"Steamstock\\\" outdoor steampunk music festival in Richmond, California, alongside steampunk favourites Abney Park, Vernian Process, Lee Presson and the Nails and others. Dolby is considered one of the early pioneers of retro-futurist (i.e. steampunk and dieselpunk) music. Amanda Palmer was once quoted as saying, \\\"Thomas Dolby is to Steampunk what Iggy Pop was to Punk!\\\"</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Thomas_Dolby_at_TED.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q553790\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":14041019,\"title\":\"Mart\\u00edn Irigoyen\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Mart\\u00edn Daniel Irigoyen</b> (born January 14, 1977) is an Argentine musician best known as a composer and guitarist of Vernian Process.

From journalism, she moved into a business role during wartime, later advising the British fashion industry and helping to form the London Fashion Group \\u2013 a forerunner to the British Fashion Council.</p>\\n<p>In 1948, she founded the first fashion course at the Royal College of Art, helping to develop a rigorous academic framework with a strong industry focus. Robert O'Byrne described Garland as among the female pioneers who: \\\"battled to have fashion design taken more seriously, in particular fighting for academic acknowledgment\\\".</p>\\n<p>Garland's obituary in <i>The Times</i> noted: \\\"She was no society featherhead, but a key figure in the history of British fashion journalism, the British fashion industry and the training of fashion designers.\\\"</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life and career</h2>\\n<p>Madge McHarg was born in Melbourne, Australia and was the third child of Andrew McHarg and Henrietta Maria Aitkin. Her father was an international shipper who exported to Australia and she had a peripatetic childhood, growing up in St John's Wood, London and attending the International School in Paris from 1912.</p>\\n<p>It was in Paris that her lifelong interest in fashion, art and literature was developed, however her parents prevented her from taking up a university place at Cambridge and she left home at 21, beginning her career as an errand girl on Fleet Street. This was considered very unusual for the times for a 'lady', especially as Garland was living independently in a boarding house in Earl's Court.</p>\\n<h2>Move to <i>Vogue</i></h2>\\n<p>In 1922, she began assisting at <i>Vogue</i> UK, just after the arrival of its second editor Dorothy Todd, who was shifting the magazine's focus away from society and towards the arts, featuring articles by Clive Bell, Aldous Huxley and Virginia Woolf. Initially, Garland was a receptionist and teagirl, also teaching herself to type. She was married briefly during this period to Captain Ewart Garland but retained the name McHarg until Gertrude Jekyll told her it was dreadful and asked if she had another. From then on, she adopted her former husband's name.</p>\\n<p>Describing how she got started, she said: \\\"I don't want to sound snobbish, but I wore extremely good and fashionable clothes...I remember Aldous Huxley saying: 'Are you dressed like that because you are on <i>Vogue</i> or are you on <i>Vogue</i> because you are dressed like that?'\\\". This same talent for looking the part gained Garland access straight into the drawing room of Lady Bowes-Lyon \\u2013 then about to announce her engagement to the Duke of York \\u2013 in order to deliver some photographic proofs from <i>Vogue</i>; Garland had taken the precaution of arriving by taxi in a Bergdorf Goodman coat. Over time, she became the proteg\\u00e9 of Todd and the two also developed a relationship and shared a flat. It appears their love affair was widely recognised in some circles as it inspired a parody of Thomas Edward Brown's poem <i>The Garden</i>, which ran: 'A Garland is a lovesome thing, Todd wot'.</p>\\n<p>During this time, Garland developed both her journalism skills and connections with leading writers and artists of the day, such as Rebecca West and Ivy Compton-Burnett \\u2013 also advising Virginia Woolf on what to wear. Woolf recounted in her diary a dinner party at Todd and Garland's flat in Royal Hospital Road, Chelsea, also attended by West, in which Todd wore sponge bag trousers and Garland wore pearls and silk. Many years later (in response to Garland's obituary), the author Nesta Macdonald reported on another party co-hosted by Garland and held at her flat in Royal Hospital Road in 1927. A fan of the Diaghilev Ballet (Ballet Russes), which had just revived <i>Les Matelots</i>, this was a fancy dress party with guests required to dress in nautical costumes. Among those attending were Lytton Strachey and Tallulah Bankhead.</p>\\n<p>She introduced Cecil Beaton to <i>Vogue</i> and was photographed by him in 1927 \\u2013 the photograph is now in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. Man Ray \\u2013 who also photographed Garland \\u2013 and George Hoyningen-Huene were also among Garland's friends and she brought them into the magazine.</p>\\n<p>Todd's tenure as <i>Vogue</i> editor lasted four years, but the magazine was losing money and its owner Cond\\u00e9 Nast disliked the literary approach. The publisher sacked Todd, who threatened to sue; Cond\\u00e9 Nast in return threatened to expose her 'morals'. Garland left with her, becoming a successful freelance writer. She contributed to the influential US fashion trade title <i>Womenswear Daily</i>, as well as writing the women's section of <i>Illustrated London News</i> between 1928-32 and contributing to <i>Eve</i> and <i>Britannia</i> magazines.</p>\\n<p>Garland returned to <i>Vogue</i> in 1932 as fashion editor, and remained involved with the magazine for the next nine years. She would travel to Paris to report on couture fashions by names such as Lucien Lelong and Jacques Fath, staying at the Ritz and taking advantage of the opportunity to buy sale-price items from Schiaparelli and Chanel \\u2013 she had a mannequin's figure.</p>\\n<h2>Fashion industry role</h2>\\n<p>During the war, Garland began working for the London department store Bourne &amp; Hollingsworth and was regarded as an excellent businesswoman. She took charge of merchandising and also did some designing herself. She also commissioned Hardy Amies to produce garments when he was on leave from the Special Operations Executive.</p>\\n<p>She began advising the fashion industry, notably helping to form the London Fashion Group, comprising Norman Hartnell, Peter Russell, Victor Stiebel and Edward Molyneux \\u2013 all of whom were members of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers.</p>\\n<p>In this advisory capacity, she went on a government-backed trip to Paris in 1947 (working with the Council for Industrial Design) to buy New Look accessories (gloves, shoes, underwear) that could then be copied by the UK fashion industry. She was armed with \\u00a31,000 to make the purchases. She also visited the United States to explore the ready-to-wear industry and its marketing methods.</p>\\n<h2>Academic appointment</h2>\\n<p>In 1947, Garland was invited to become the first professor of fashion at the Royal College of Art by Robin Darwin, taking up the role a year later. As her <i>Times</i> obituary notes, she had to effectively invent the course \\u2013 creating an academic framework that would serve the industry. As most of the available art teachers didn't have the required background, Garland brought in teachers from industry, notably cutters from the fashion trade, also liaising with the Manchester textile industry to source materials and designs.</p>\\n<p>Interviewed in 1972, she recalled how much of a struggle it was to convince the powers that be that her decision was right: \\\"there was an awful row with the Department of Education. But I wanted people from the trade \\u2013 trade was a dreadful word to use in connection with art. So I formed a committee of very high powered people from industry and drew teachers from the trade...I got the trade to serve on the committee and to give bursaries and do competitions and to take students for a period in the vacations to work in their businesses. I tried so hard to marry art and industry \\u2013 previously there had been no contact, the principals of the art colleges had never been inside a fashion house, they were grey haired and well meaning in those sort of Fairisle smocks.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In an interview for the Victoria and Albert Museum, one of her students Gerald McCann \\u2013 later to have a long and successful career in the United States as well as Britain \\u2013 recalled her strong links to industry. He would begin working for Marks &amp; Spencer even before he graduated. Other influential designers trained by Garland included Gina Fratini and David Sassoon. She is also said to have inspired Hardy Amies to set up his first fashion enterprise.</p>\\n<p>Although Garland had created the framework that would train so many post-war designers, she has been, according to the Royal College of Art, somewhat neglected as a figure in the history of fashion. She left the RCA after its first full graduation show in 1956 and was succeeded by Janey Ironside. Her resignation was reported in the papers, with Garland expressing the view that, after eight years in academia it was time for a change. <i>The Times</i> noted: \\\"one of her most important achievements has been to bring both to students and manufacturers the understanding that fashion design is not by any means restricted to <i>haute couture</i> and to the creation of ball gowns requiring a hundred yards of tulle and a box of sequins\\\".</p>\\n<h2>Later life and career</h2>\\n<p>Garland continued to act as an advisor to industry, working with Terylene and knitwear manufacturers. She was the author/co-author of several books, including <i>The Changing Face of Beauty</i> (1957), <i>The Changing Face of Fashion</i> (1970) and <i>A History of Fashion</i> (1975).</p>\\n<p>A founder member of the Contemporary Art Society, she was herself the subject of portraits by notable artists, including one by Marie Laurencin that she owned, and another by Edward Wolfe that now hangs in the Geffrye Museum.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Madge_Garland.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q17421375\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":27286521,\"title\":\"Sajid Javid\",\"text\":\"<p>The Rt.

They particularly influenced Ernest Gimson who, in 1890, spent six weeks with Clissett learning to make ladderback chairs. Clissett's chairs were popular with the Arts and Crafts cognoscenti, and were used by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in early commissions, and by the architectural team of Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin.

Barrister (called 1970), Crown Court Recorder (1982), Queen's Counsel (1987), Bencher, Gray's Inn (1996). He has prosecuted and defended most forms of serious crime and serious criminals, and specialises in commercial fraud.</p>\\n<h2>Political career</h2>\\n<p>Marshall-Andrews joined the Labour Party in 1971 and contested the constituency of Richmond, Surrey in October 1974. He was asked to stand for the Medway Constituency in 1992 which he lost to the incumbent Conservative, Dame Peggy Fenner. He is a Member of Association of Labour Lawyers, Greenpeace, and the Woodland Trust.</p>\\n<p>Marshall-Andrews entered Parliament in the 1997 general election. He is perceived as being on the libertarian-left wing of the Labour Party, and was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, but unlike other members of this group is not a trade-unionist by background. He was successfully re-elected in 2001, tackling the immigration issue head-on and telling a voter: \\\"The difference between you and me is that you are a racist and I am not. [\\u2026 ] And under no circumstances are you allowed to vote for me. You will not vote for me!\\\"</p>\\n<p>Despite his leftist position, however, he nominated Gordon Brown (rather than John McDonnell) for the Labour Party leadership and Peter Hain as deputy leader in 2007. After a period of bedding down as a new MP, where he aided in the drafting of the banning of handguns, he became an irritant to the government front bench. He rebelled against the government on multiple occasions (20 of those rebellions being in the 2005 parliament), mainly on legal issues. He was often mentioned as a candidate for backbencher of the year and is widely respected in the Westminster media circuit.</p>\\n<p>During the night of the 2005 general election, he appeared on national television commenting on his predicted defeat before it had been officially declared, as the only good news Tony Blair would get that night, and launched a scathing attack on the Prime Minister. But he managed to hold on to the seat, with a narrow majority of 213 votes.</p>\\n<p>His penchant for rebellion, combined with his friendliness towards many Conservative MPs, led him to become unpopular within parts of his own party. According to <i>The Times</i>, senior Labour MPs demanded that the whip be withdrawn from him as an example to the 49 Labour MPs who rebelled against the government's plans to detain terror suspects for 90 days.</p>\\n<p>On 15 June 2008, with former Labour Cabinet Minister Tony Benn, Marshall-Andrews again rebelled in his support for Conservative MP David Davis' campaign to step down as an MP and force a by-election in his constituency over the bill for a maximum 42-day detention without charge for arrested suspects. Such an action would normally be against party rules, although he believed his withdrawal from the Labour Party whip was improbable because the party was unlikely to put up a candidate against Davis in the by-election. He felt through his action that \\\"the voice of a substantial part of the Labour party may be heard\\\" over a measure which gained strong resistance among Labour MPs and supporters.</p>\\n<p>On 17 July 2007, he said he would stand down as a Labour MP at the next election.</p>\\n<h2>Controversy</h2>\\n<p>During a break in the Terror Bill debate on 9 November 2005, Marshall-Andrews was seen talking to Conservative MPs Andrew Mitchell, Greg Knight and Damian Green in the Commons lobby. Labour MP Barry Sheerman remonstrated with him. Fellow Labour MP Jim Dowd intervened and at one stage grabbed Marshall-Andrews by the lapels. Dowd and several observers believed they heard him saying of Dowd, \\\"Here's another faggot\\\". The near-scuffle was broken up by government whip Tom Watson, but was widely reported. Marshall-Andrews subsequently insisted that he had actually shouted \\\"faccio\\\", an Italian word meaning a menial assistant, from which the public school slang 'fag' is thought to derive. The incident was mentioned by Marshall-Andrews on the satirical news quiz <i>Have I Got News For You</i>.</p>\\n<p>On 31 October 2006, Marshall-Andrews was one of 12 Labour MPs to back Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party's call for an inquiry into the Iraq War.</p>\\n<p>In December 2008, Marshall-Andrews became the first Labour MP to publicly call for the resignation of Speaker Michael Martin over the arrest of Damian Green.</p>\\n<h2>Social views and outside interests</h2>\\n<p>He is widely regarded as a social libertarian.</p>\\n<p>He is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association. He is also Founder and Trustee of the George Adamson Wildlife Trust, currently running Mkomazi Game Reserve, Tanzania. Trustee and Chair of Development Committee, Geffrye Museum, London.

Eine produced a number of custom clothing designs notably some custom \\\"VANDALS\\\" sweatshirts and started to explore screen prints eventually working as a screen printer for cult screen print company Pictures On Walls. Eine produced many of the hand pulled prints for artists represented by POW including Banksy, Jamie Hewlett, Mode2, Modern Toss and David Shrigley. His natural talent for colour combinations meant that he was able to enhance the work supplied by the artists.

Dropping out of his studies, he moved back to London and started to learn studio engineering, ending up working in the No U-Turn studios which at the time was involved in the nascent jungle scene of the early 1990s. During his spare time, Carter began making his own tracks, which caught the ear of Mark Jones, the founder of the Wall of Sound record label. Carter was eventually signed to Wall of Sound and released his first record \\\"The Dollar\\\" under the name Artery.</p>\\n<p>At around the same time, Carter was beginning to develop a reputation as one of the regular DJs at The Heavenly Social, a Sunday evening club in the Albany pub on Great Portland Street in central London. Alongside the other regular DJs The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim and Richard Fearless of Death in Vegas, the night was instrumental in developing the form of electronic dance music that became known as big beat, with its mix of rock, hip hop, breakbeat and rave, as well as dance.</p>\\n<p>In 1995 Carter left Wall of Sound and signed with Heavenly Records to produce dub and dancehall-influenced dance music under the name of Monkey Mafia. The project developed into a full band playing live shows, and an album, <i>Shoot the Boss</i>, appeared in 1998. By now he was also in demand to produce mix albums and remix songs by bands as diverse as U2, Manic Street Preachers and The Beach Boys. By the end of the 1990s he had secured DJ residencies at several nightclubs in the UK and was regularly playing sets abroad.</p>\\n<p>In 1999 Carter moved back to Wall of Sound and its new subsidiary Nu Camp to release \\\"Women Beat Their Men\\\", a house record under the new pseudonym of Junior Cartier. In 2003 he and fellow DJ Tim Sheridan formed a short-lived record company, Saville Row, and released a few singles on the label.</p>\\n<p>A severe bout of tinnitus curtailed his DJing activity and brought a halt to his record productions for a couple of years, but by 2008 Carter had returned, first with another one-off collaboration with Tim Sheridan, and then \\\"The Rabbit\\\" with Stretch Silvester of Stretch &amp; Vern, the first single in a planned series of collaborations with other DJs under the name Gentleman's Agreement. He has also teamed up with Liverpool-born, New York-based DJ Alex Blanco under the name Roosevelt High. In 2009 he became a member of the Rizla Invisible Players, an ever-changing collective of musicians and artists. Alongside Carter, the 2009 line-up included Jazzie B, Micachu, Gruff Rhys and David Shrigley and performed at a number of festivals across the UK that year, including RockNess, Lovebox, The Big Chill and Bestival.</p>\\n<h2>Business ventures</h2>\\n<p>Carter's first foray into business was in 1998 when he became co-owner of The Lock Tavern pub in Camden, London. In 2004 he co-founded 580 Limited, a company which owned several live music pub venues, initially across the UK but later solely in London. Working with the company, Carter helped to set up The Lock Tavern Tent at the Glastonbury Festival from 2003 until 2010, and a Lock Tavern arena at the Field Day festival in 2010. The company was also involved with the Beacons Festival that takes place annually near Skipton in North Yorkshire. In October 2014 the four pubs in the 580 Limited chain were sold to the brewer Young's.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q16213370\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1}],\"lon\":-0.031666666666667,\"wikidata\":\"Q5446893\",\"lat\":51.539166666667,\"pageid\":25522443,\"ns\":0,\"type\":\"event\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":2265.7,\"title\":\"Chisenhale Gallery\",\"extract\":\"<p><b>Chisenhale Gallery</b> is a non-profit contemporary art gallery based in London's East End.</p>\\n<p>The organisation focuses on a programme of commissioned exhibitions, offsite projects and events, performances, film screenings and talks.

Her single-channel videos are distributed by Electronic Arts Intermix in New York, NY. She currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Biography</h2>\\n<p>Baldino earned a BFA in sculpture from the Hartford Art School in Connecticut. She has taught at New York University, and conducted workshops at the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen, Denmark; the Malm\\u00f6 Art Academy in Sweden; and the Statens Kunstakademi in Oslo, Norway.</p>\\n<p>She has given lectures throughout the U.S. at major institutions, including Rhode Island School of Design in Providence; Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York; Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts, Omaha, Nebraska; Parsons The New School in New York; the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; and Art In General, New York.</p>\\n<p>In 2001 and 1996, Baldino was a finalist for an international media / art award at the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe / Sudwestrundfunk and International Video Arts Award (respectively) in Baden-Baden. In 2011 and 1999, she was an Artist-in-Residence at the Wexner Center for the Arts, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio; and in 2005, at the Experimental Television Center, Newark Valley, NY. She has received grants from the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA), Jerome Foundation, Art Matters Inc., and the California Community Foundation.</p>\\n<h2>Work</h2>\\n<p>Baldino explores the intangible boundaries between the material and metaphysical world by mounting large-scale video installations, which address perception, memory, and scientific phenomena. Ironically approaching the medium of video, her topics include quantum physics, parallel universes, nano-technology, and fuzzy logic. Many of her installations have also been presented as single-channel videos.</p>\\n<p>With <i>April 1994: The Gray Band</i> (1994) Baldino asked Los Angeles musicians Dez Cadena, Lynn Johnston, Tom Watson, and Mike Watt to reassemble instruments, including a microphone, metal clarinet, sawed-up guitar, and bass, and then asked them to play \\\"I Will Survive,\\\" which she then recorded on video. In her next film, <i>In the Present</i> (1996), Baldino was inspired by William James' temporal definition of the present, which can only occur in a span of time ranging from three to 12 seconds. Within this definition, Baldino ties time to perception by offering 50 discrete experiences of information in the present time \\u2013 with videos ranging in time from three to 12 seconds each \\u2013 but using the viewer's memory to account for the links between the videos.</p>\\n<p>Baldino's 2011 film <i>Suitcase / Not Suitcase / Suitcase</i>, is an excerpt from her 1993 \\\"Gray Area\\\" series that was shown in Times Square on the MTV Screen on April 13\\u201319, 2011, for the 40th Anniversary of Electronic Arts Intermix, New York. During the presentation, Baldino walked anonymously through the square with the suitcase.</p>\\n<h2>Exhibitions</h2>\\n<p>Baldino has had solo exhibitions at Lauren Wittels Gallery, New York (1995, 1996); Thomas Nordanstad Gallery, New York (1996); Pierogi, Brooklyn (2001); Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati (2001); Threewalls, Chicago (2005); Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, Ohio (2011); Studio 10, Brooklyn (2013).</p>\\n<p>She has participated in group exhibitions at a number of international institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Dia Center for the Arts, New York; Guggenheim Museum Soho, New York; P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, New York; Air de Paris, Nice; Four Walls, New York; Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies; and Independent Art Space, London.</p>\\n<h2>Screenings and Festivals</h2>\\n<p>Her work has also been included in numerous national and international film and video festivals, including the Impakt Festival (2002, 2001, 1999), the New York Video Festival (2002), the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen (2001), media_city seoul (2000), and the World Wide Video Festival (2000, 1998, 1996).</p>\\n<p>Recent screenings of her works include:</p>\\n<ul><li>\\\"Plank Salad\\\" screening (2013), curated by Helen Marten, Chisenhale Gallery, London</li>\\n<li>e-flux screening (2009), curated by Michael Smith, The Building, Platz der Vereinten Nationen, Berlin</li>\\n<li>Documentary Fortnight (2006), curated by Sally Berger and William Sloan, Museum of Modern Art, New York</li>\\n</ul><h2>Select Videography</h2>\\n<p>Multi-channel Video Installations</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Phyllis_Baldino_in_May_2007.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q16186978\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":158382,\"title\":\"Rachel Whiteread\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Rachel Whiteread</b>, CBE (born 20 April 1963) is an English artist who primarily produces sculptures, which typically take the form of casts. She won the annual Turner Prize in 1993 \\u2013 the first woman to win the prize.</p>\\n<p>Whiteread is one of the Young British Artists, and exhibited at the Royal Academy's <i>Sensation</i> exhibition in 1997. Among her most renowned works are <i>House</i>, a large concrete cast of the inside of an entire Victorian house, the holocaust memorial sculpture in Judenplatz Vienna and for her resin sculpture for the empty plinth in London's Trafalgar Square.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life and education</h2>\\n<p>Whiteread was born in 1963 in Ilford, Essex, and raised in the Essex countryside until age seven, when the family moved to London. Her mother, Patricia Whiteread (n\\u00e9e Lancaster), who was also an artist, died in 2003 at the age of 72. Her death had a profound impact on Rachel's work. Her father, Thomas Whiteread, was a geography teacher, polytechnic administrator and lifelong supporter of the Labour Party, who died when Whiteread was studying at art school in 1988. She is the third of three sisters \\u2013 the older two being identical twins.</p>\\n<p>Whiteread studied at the Faculty of Arts and Architecture, Brighton Polytechnic from 1982 to 1985. Though she graduated with a BA in painting, she spent much of her time doing sculpture. She took a workshop on casting with the sculptor Richard Wilson and began to realize the possibilities in casting objects. She was briefly at the Cyprus College of Art. From 1985 to 1987 she studied sculpture at Slade School of Art, University College, London, graduating with an MA in 1987. For a time she worked in Highgate Cemetery fixing lids back onto time-damaged coffins. She began to exhibit in 1987, with her first solo exhibition coming in 1988. She lives and works in a former synagogue in east London with long-term partner and fellow sculptor Marcus Taylor. They have two sons.</p>\\n<h2>Work</h2>\\n<p>Many of Whiteread's works are casts of ordinary domestic objects and, in numerous cases, the space the objects <i>do not</i> inhabit (often termed the \\\"negative space\\\") \\u2014 instead producing a solid cast of where the space within a container would be; particular parts of rooms, the area underneath furniture, for example. She says the casts carry \\\"the residue of years and years of use\\\". Whiteread mainly focuses on the line and the form for her pieces.</p>\\n<p>While still at the Slade, Whiteread cast domestic objects and created her first sculpture, <i>Closet</i>. She made a plaster cast of the interior of a wooden wardrobe and covered it with black felt. It was based on comforting childhood memories of hiding in a dark closet. After she graduated she rented space for a studio using the Enterprise Allowance Scheme. In 1988 She created <i>Shallow Breath</i>, the cast of the underside of a bed, made not long after her father died. Both sculptures were exhibited in her first solo show in 1988 along with casts of other domestic pieces. The work all sold and allowed her to apply for grants to find funding for larger sculptures.</p>\\n<h3><i>Ghost</i></h3>\\n<p>After her first solo exhibition, Whiteread decided to cast the space that her domestic objects could have inhabited. She applied for grants, describing the project as \\\"mummifying the air in a room.\\\" She completed <i>Ghost</i> in 1990. It was cast from a room in a house on Archway Road in north London, much like the house she grew up in. The road was being widened and the house torn down. She used plaster to cast the parlor walls and ceiling in sections and assembled them on a metal frame.</p>\\n<p><i>Ghost</i> was first shown at the nonprofit Chisenhale Gallery. It was purchased by Charles Saatchi and included with other works by Whiteread in his first \\\"Young British Art\\\" show in 1992. In May 2004 a fire in a Momart storage warehouse destroyed many works from the Saatchi collection, including, it is believed, some by Whiteread. However <i>Ghost</i> had recently been moved from the warehouse to the new Gagosian Gallery in London. The work was acquired by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in the fall of 2004.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Untitled_(Twenty_Four_Switches),_Tate_Liverpool.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q454041\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":2978995,\"title\":\"Rob Diament\",\"text\":\"<p><br></p>\\n<p><b>Robert Diament</b> (born 1980 in Reading, Berkshire, England) is an English singer-songwriter best known as the lead singer of UK electronic rock band Temposhark. In 2010, Diament began working as a gallerist with Carl Freedman, a contemporary art gallery in East London.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Diament grew up in Berkshire and began to play classical piano (his first instrument) at the age of four. Diament's classical training continued in piano and violin, whilst at the same time he learnt to sing in a local church choir. Songwriting soon followed but Diament only began to record his music at the age of thirteen. At his secondary school in Reading, Diament met Luke Busby for the first time, his later collaborator in Temposhark, but interestingly the two never collaborated until leaving school many years later. Diament and Busby also studied alongside Hollywood actress Natalie Dormer. However, Diament sang in a number of rock bands and became a regular concertgoer in the town, best known for the annual rock festival Reading Festival. In his later teens, Diament's live performances in London and Reading had attracted much interest from both high profile musicians and music industry professionals alike, which led to the recording of his debut EP.</p>\\n<h2>Early musical career</h2>\\n<p>Diament first arrived on the music scene in 1999 with his debut piano-oriented solo EP 'Seven Years Running' produced by Anthony Amos. Following this release, he further developed his sound on tour in North America and returned to London in 2000 to record a selection of new songs with producer Stuart Epps (Elton John/Robbie Williams) before spending the following two years writing and recording with Killing Joke member and award winning producer, Youth aka Martin Glover. In 2000, British pop culture magazine <i>The Face</i> highlighted Diament as an artist to watch and \\\"songwriter of genius\\\". Around this time, Diament began to spend time in Brighton collaborating on a number of art, music and performance projects with old Reading school friend Luke Busby and Busby's fellow art student Natasha Kahn, now known for her project Bat for Lashes. This led Diament and Busby to study music in London at University of Westminster where Temposhark was formed in 2004. Diament and Busby both graduated in 2005 with First Class Honours. Other key bands/artists that studied alongside them were The Departure, Pure Reason Revolution, Kevin Mark Trail (The Streets) and Emmy The Great.</p>\\n<h2>Temposhark</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 2004, Diament emerged as lead singer/principal songwriter with Temposhark, the critically acclaimed UK electronic rock band. Diament formed the band developing a distinctive blend of epic filmscore and late 70s/early 80s synth pop. His first nationwide released UK single <i>It's Better To Have Loved</i> came out on 12 December 2005 produced by acclaimed producer Guy Sigsworth (Madonna/Bj\\u00f6rk/Frou Frou) on Diament's own record label Paper and Glue.</p>\\n<p>Temposhark finished recording their debut album <i>The Invisible Line</i> during February 2007 in London with producer Sean McGhee as well as recording a new song with Guy Sigsworth. The album will be released worldwide in early March 2008. Temposhark were in New York on a UK music industry trade mission in June 2006 and started performing live in Europe including a sold out headline gig in Paris the following July. In November 2006, Temposhark began performing with their live band, Mathis Richet on drums and Mark Ferguson on bass. The four live musicians travelled to the USA to Austin, Texas in March 2007 for two live showcases at the SXSW festival. Temposhark head out on their first USA clubs and theatre tour in June 2007 performing alongside Diament's friend, the popstar Darren Hayes</p>\\n<p>As part of Temposhark, Diament has written songs and sung with a diverse array of musicians from Frou Frou's Guy Sigsworth and Imogen Heap, Kate Havnevik, Sophie Solomon, Morgan Page, MaJiKer, Sean McGhee, Cursor Miner, Avril (FCommunications), Metronomy, Mark Moore (S'Express), MIA, Camille, Hellogoodbye, Matthew Jay, Akira The Don, Noblesse Oblige, Princess Julia, Richard Norris (The Grid), Melnyk, Kevin Freeman, Border Crossing and Masashi Naka (Escalator Records, Japan).</p>\\n<p>In 2005, Diament said that his band name Temposhark was thought up when he \\\"woke up in the midst of a dream one night, at like 4am, and just said the word Temposhark. So it came from my subconscious I guess. Honestly it was that simple. I wanted a name that sounded strong. I liked the idea that music could be a weapon. Something powerful.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Temposhark's second album <i>Threads</i> was released in April 2010 including the singles <i>The World Does Not Revolve Around You</i> and <i>Bye Bye Baby</i>. It reached number 15 on the UK iTunes Top 20 electronic album chart.</p>\\n<h2>Writer</h2>\\n<p>As well as a songwriter, Diament has written for music magazines such as <i>Blowback</i> in the UK and <i>BPM</i> and <i>Redefine</i> magazines in the USA.

It was founded in 1984, called Interim Art during the 1990s, and renamed Maureen Paley in 2004. She exhibited Young British Artists at an early stage. Artists represented include Turner Prize winners, Gillian Wearing and Wolfgang Tillmans.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n\\n<p>Maureen Paley was born in New York, the daughter of Alfred Paley and Sylvia Paley; she attended Sarah Lawrence College, and graduated from Brown University in 1975. Her artwork appears on the cover of the Summer 1973 edition of <i>Sarah Lawrence Magazine</i>.</p>\\n<p>She received Russian training as a ballet dancer. She emigrated to England in 1977, attending The Royal College of Art, where she gained an MA in photography. In 1978, she met and became one of the first London friends of Helen Chadwick, who, like Paley, lived in Beck Road, Bethnal Green. Paley and other friends took part in Chadwick's first London show, a feminist performance titled <i>In the Kitchen</i>, by strapping themselves in a canvas model of a cooker. Chadwick guided Paley in the conversion of her home into a space for art exhibitions. Paley said, \\\"Helen was always talking about craftsmanship\\u2014a constant fount of information\\\".</p>\\n<h2>1980s</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1984, Paley began a gallery programme in her Victorian terraced house. During the late 1980s, she exhibited examples of contemporary art by Tim Rollins and K.O.S., Sarah Charlesworth, Charles Ray, Mike Kelley, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Rosemarie Trockel and G\\u00fcnther F\\u00f6rg. The first artists that Paley exhibited as \\\"represented\\\" artists were Langlands and Bell, Hannah Collins, Angela Bulloch and Helen Chadwick.</p>\\n<h2>1990s</h2>\\n<p>From December 1990, through December 1991, the gallery, known as Interim Art, relocated to Dering Street in central London, close to Anthony d'Offay Gallery.</p>\\n<p>In the early 1990s, the gallery presented several exhibitions made by the burgeoning group of artists that were to become known as the YBAs\\u2014including, Henry Bond, Angela Bulloch and Liam Gillick. For years she developed the careers of Gillian Wearing and Wolfgang Tillmans. During the 1990s, Paley represented artist and designer Toby Mott. At this time, she was an associate of Joshua Compston.</p>\\n<p>In 2000, Matthew Collings said, \\\"everybody knows who the good YBAs are: the ones Maureen and the unrealist colleagues have signed up!\\\" She was called by <i>Time Out</i> \\\"a true pioneer of the East End\\\", having presented work there before it was fashionable. She said of London, \\\"There is tremendous talent here, indeed much more talent than there is a market,\\\" and that \\\"the problem lies with the limited interest of the audience. Change and newness has always been very dubious in Britain.\\\" The gallery ran at a loss for almost a decade, and was supported by Arts Council grants and other patronage. Paley herself served for many years on advisory committees to the Arts Council and the London Arts Board, and received travel grants from the Arts Council during her tenure.</p>\\n<p>In 1994, she was one of 35 art world signatories to a letter in the <i>Evening Standard</i> demanding that its art critic, Brian Sewell should be sacked for his \\\"artistic prejudice\\\". A letter in response from 20 other art world signatories accused the writers of attempted censorship to promote \\\"a relentless programme of neo-conceptual art in all the main London venues\\\".</p>\\n<p>On the morning of 15 March 1996, Chadwick visited to collect a fax, while Paley was busy on the phone. Chadwick died later that day of a heart attack, during a visit to the Architects' Association.</p>\\n<p>In September 1999, the gallery moved to Herald Street in Bethnal Green, occupying \\\"a chic new industrial space.\\\" Paley's base in the area was a precedent for leading galleries such as White Cube and Victoria Miro to also locate in the East End.\\\"</p>\\n<h3>Curated exhibitions</h3>\\n<p>In 1994, Paley curated a show at Camden Arts Centre of work by Joseph Kosuth, Ad Reinhardt and F\\u00e9lix Gonz\\u00e1lez-Torres. In 1995, she presented <i>Wall to Wall</i> featuring wall drawings by artists including Daniel Buren, Michael Craig-Martin, Douglas Gordon, Barbara Kruger, Sol LeWitt, and Lawrence Weiner. The National Touring Exhibitions show went to the Serpentine Gallery, London, Southampton City Art Gallery, and Leeds City Art Gallery. In 1996, for the Henry Moore Sculpture Trust, Paley curated <i>The Cauldron</i>, an exhibition of work by Young British Artists\\u2014Christine Borland, Angela Bulloch, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Steven Pippin, Georgina Starr and Gillian Wearing. It was installed in the Trust's studio space in Dean Clough, Halifax.</p>\\n<h2>2000s</h2>\\n<p>In 2000, Paley staged <i>The Agony and the Ecstasy</i>, the first show of Rebecca Warren, who had approached her with polaroids in a bar, after Paley had given a talk at her art school.</p>\\n<p>She said in 2001, \\\"Being a tastemaker\\u2014someone who invents the future\\u2014requires a delicate balance. You need to be of your time\\u2014if you're too far ahead you'll be misunderstood.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In 2004, the gallery's name was changed from Interim Art to Maureen Paley. In 2006, when asked why many women have been successful in contemporary art dealing, Paley said,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>\\\"Art is one of the last unregulated markets. There are no male gatekeepers and you are not confined to traditional alpha-male values. That makes it very attractive to a certain type of woman with a strong personality, who wouldn't fit into a cookie-cutter working environment, like investment banking.\\\"</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>In 2007, the artist Gillian Wearing was elected to a lifetime membership of the Royal Academy of Art in London (an institution founded by royal warrant by King George III, in 1768), that is, she became a \\\"Royal Academician.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In 2008, Paley sold a photograph by artist Anne Hardy to the British Government Art Collection for \\u00a35,875. She was one of the judges of New Sensations, a competition for art students promoted by Channel 4 and the Saatchi Gallery. Jo Craven said in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> that Paley was one of only five female gallery owners of note in London. The <i>Evening Standard</i> included her in London's 50 most influential people in art and design in 2008 and 2009.</p>\\n<p>In 2009, she was placed at 87 (from 70 the previous year) in <i>ArtReview's</i> art world Power 100 list. The citation drew attention to the presence of gallery artists at major events, such as Michael Landy at Tate Liverpool, Rebecca Warren at the Serpentine Gallery and Wolfgang Tillmans at the Venice Biennale. Her own gallery programme had an unpredictable agenda, ranging from abstract paintings by David Ratcliff, a new Los Angeles artist, to a long film by Lars Laumann about a prisoner on death-row. With a grant of \\u00a325,862 from The Art Fund and as a partial gift from the artist and Paley, the Arts Council purchased nine framed photographic prints by Tillmans for a total of \\u00a351,724.</p>\\n<p>In August 2009, reflecting on the legacy of the YBA art scene, Paley said, \\\"The thing that came out of the YBA generation was boldness, a belief that you can do anything.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In 2009, Paley was elected to the Executive Committee of the Society of London Art Dealers.</p>\\n<h2>2010s</h2>\\n<p>In 2010, Paley was one of a group of art dealers including Sadie Coles who made up the selection committee for the Frieze Art Fair. She supports the exhibition programme of the Serpentine Gallery, and is a benefactor of the South London Gallery.</p>\\n<p>Paley is also a patron of Camden Arts Centre, Chisenhale Gallery, Tate Gallery, and the Whitechapel Art Gallery.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Bethnal_Green_stn_southwest_entrance.JPG\",\"wikidata\":\"Q6792748\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":5550723,\"title\":\"Alice Rawsthorn\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Alice Rawsthorn</b> OBE (born 1958 in Manchester) is a British design critic, who writes on design in the international edition of <i>The New York Times</i>.

Tillmans lives in Berlin and London.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Life and career</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>Tillmans was born on August 16, 1968 in Remscheid.</p>\\n<p>During his first visit to England as an exchange student in 1983, he discovered the British youth culture and the local fashion and music magazines of the time. From 1987 through 1990, he lived in Hamburg where he also had his first solo exhibitions at Caf\\u00e9 Gnosa, Front and Frarik-Foto-Forum. From 1990 through 1992, he studied at Bournemouth and Poole College of Art and Design in southern England. After his studies he moved to London and then to New York in 1994 for a year, where he met the German painter Jochen Klein. After moving back to England, Tillmans lived with Klein until he died of AIDS-related complications in 1997.</p>\\n<p>From 1995, Wolfgang Tillmans primarily lived and worked in London. During the summer of 1998, Tillmans participated in a month-long residency at the last active Shaker community in the world, in Sabbathday Lake, Maine. Since 2007, he has divided his time between Berlin and London. Following a guest professorship at the Hochschule f\\u00fcr bildende Kunst in Hamburg from 1998 to 1999 and his Honorary Fellowship at the Arts University College at Bournemouth in 2001, Tillmans had been a professor for Interdisciplinary Art at the St\\u00e4delschule in Frankfurt am Main from 2003 till 2006. In 2001, Tillmans was awarded first prize in the competition for the design of the AIDS memorial for the City of Munich, whereupon the memorial was erected after his designs at the Sendlinger Tor. In 2011, Tillmans travelled to Haiti with the charity Christian Aid to document reconstruction work after the country's devastating earthquake one year before.</p>\\n<p>Between 2009 and 2014, Tillmans is serving as an Artist Trustee of the Tate Board. He also is a member of the museum's Collection Committee and the Tate Britain Council.</p>\\n<h2>Work</h2>\\n<h3>Beginnings</h3>\\n\\n<p>Wolfgang Tillmans was initially known for his seemingly casual, sometimes snapshotlike portraits of friends (most notably, fashion designer Lutz Huelle and fellow artist Alexandra Bircken) and other youth in his immediate surroundings and scene. His photos \\u2013 from the Europride in London (1992) or the Love Parade in Berlin (1992) for example \\u2013 appeared in magazines such as <i>i-D, Spex, Interview, SZ-Magazin</i> and <i>Butt-Magazine</i>, and have established his reputation as a prominent witness of a contemporary social movement. He was made co-editor of <i>Spex</i> in 1997. For the <i>Index Magazine</i>, he shot covers and assignments, including images of John Waters, Gilbert &amp; George, and Udo Kier.</p>\\n<p>Tillmans was considered the \\u201cdocumentarian of his generation, especially that of the London club and gay scenes.\\u201d Half of his work is staged, with the artist choosing the clothes and the location, as well as setting his models up in their positions. The series of his friends Lutz and Alex, also published in <i>i-D</i> in 1992, are considered important photographic documents of the 1990s. From 1992 to 1994 Tillmans lived and worked in London, moving to New York in 1994. During this time, he began to show more frequently, developing an exhibition style that consisted of nonhierarchical arrangements of unframed photographs pinned or taped onto the gallery\\u2019s walls. Color photographs are placed next to inkjet prints and next to postcards and magazine clippings of his own images, reaching almost to the ceiling and the floor. He views each exhibition as a site-specific installation, often addressing the exhibition space as a larger composition.</p>\\n<h3>\\\"Pictures, in order to see the world\\u201d</h3>\\n<p>Wolfgang Tillmans\\u2019 photographic practice has since developed to encompass a wide array of genres. His portraits, still lifes, sky photographs (i.e. the <i>Concorde</i> series), astrophotography, aerial shots and landscapes were all motivated equally by aesthetic and political interests and in formulations of reality and truth claims \\u2013 particularly in relation to homosexuality and gender identity. Tillmans puts it like this: \\u201cI take pictures, in order to see the world.\\u201d Tillmans produces his photographs in different sizes and formats in meticulous wall-installations, combining them with photocopies, magazine and newspaper clippings (particularly in the installation known as \\u201cSoldiers \\u2013 The Nineties\\u201d). The photographs are sometimes taped directly onto the wall, presented in vitrines, or arranged on extensive table-installations (\\u201ctruth study center\\u201d). Operating on the basis of the fundamental equality of all motifs and supports, through this continual re-arranging, repositioning, questioning and reinforcement, Tillmans avoids ascribing any \\u2018conclusions\\u2019 to his work and thus repeatedly subjects his own photographic vision to a perpetual re-contextualization.</p>\\n<p>In 2009, after Tillmans had been using an analog 50\\u00a0mm Contax SLR camera almost exclusively for over two decades, he turned to digital photography. In 2012, he described the corresponding change from using viewfinders to integrated camera monitors as \\\"completely turning onto its head the psychology of photography, which has always been a dialogue between photographer, object and the imaginary image which one is envisioning, thinking, hoping for\\\", whereas the higher resolution of digital photographies follows \\\"a transformation in the whole world\\\", according to Tillmans: \\\"In recent years, everything has become HD, so I think it is inevitable that the overwhelming nature of this information density is reflected in my images. Hence, they are describing my feeling of perception quite well again today.\\\"</p>\\n<h4>Grids</h4>\\n<p>The 56 photographs of equal dimensions that make up the <i>Concorde Grid</i> were taken in and around London as part of a commission for Tillmans\\u2019 exhibition at Chisenhale Gallery in 1997. They were shot from a wide range of places including private gardens, parks, railway tracks and the perimeter fence around Heathrow airport, recording the daily passing of the airplane. <i>Total Solar Eclipse Grid</i> (1998), a set of which was included in his Turner Prize installation and is now in the permanent collection of the Tate, documents the spectacle of a solar eclipse. Each of the 21 photographs in the grid was taken during the eclipse of his immediate surroundings in a tropical locale, with varying degrees of light and detail. <i>Snow/Ice Grid</i> (1999) is a grid of images of trampled and melting ice and snow.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Tillmans_crop.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q704012\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":34663489,\"title\":\"Jordan Wolfson\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Jordan Wolfson</b> (born 1980 in New York City, New York) is an artist living and working in New York and Los Angeles.

His father Bengt, who was Jewish, died in a car accident in 1971 and he was brought up by his Protestant mother with his sister. He moved around Sweden until the age of 24 when he moved to Berlin to study. His life has since been marked by nomadism and constant movement where travel and international dialogues are core to his life and practice. He lived in London and Los Angeles until he created his base in Paris in 2002. H\\u00fcttner was one of the founders of the non-profit galleries Konstakuten in Stockholm (1996\\u20132001) and The Hood Gallery in Los Angeles (2001\\u20132003), the former was one of the first artist initiated galleries in the country and was important in creating a culture of self-organisation of artists in Sweden. He is also one of the founders of the residency programs Norrk\\u00f6ping AIR  and initiator of the experimental research group Vision Forum.</p>\\n<h2>Works</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>H\\u00fcttner's work investigates impermanence as a global principle, especially how ideas of permanence and purity are used to perpetuate social, political and economical structures and how that influences human communication and interaction. The work often deals with transformation, change or various forms of transgressions of boundaries or borders. The artist is inspired by French philosopher Gilles Deleuze and particularly interested in how the relationship between larger political, economical and social structures affect the individual and vice versa. His work dialogues with the history of performance and explores the genre in innovative ways by provoking the curiosity and imagination of the visitor as well as by reflecting on notions about time, knowledge and the human body.</p>\\n<p>In the late 1980s and 1990s much of H\\u00fcttner's installations used computers, video and other new media. He was one of the first artists to create installations that used computers as a sculptural element and at the same time allowing them to present vast and complex information. The artist also used contemporary medical science to develop work based on research on the human brain at the <i>Pitt Rivers Museum</i> in Oxford, England - looking at how the brain remains in a constant state of change and regeneration. He also created exhibitions, publications and lectures with biochemist Elias Arn\\u00e9r that dealt with the relationship between art, science and the human body in Stockholm. In Begrepp - En Samling (Concepts a Collection) they brought together artists and scientists to dialogue about metaphysical questions.</p>\\n<p>In the late 1990s H\\u00fcttner took his interdiscplinary experiences and implemented these into a series of exhibitions investigating the relationship between the art object and the exhibition. In 2001 he co-curated an exhibition at Nylon with Goshka Macuga and Gavin Wade. Other noteworthy exhibitions that dealt with these issues and that engaged the audience in continuously reshaping the exhibition include: I am a Curator at <i>Chisenhale Gallery</i> in London, Repetitive Time at The Art Museum in Gothenburg and <i>Participate?</i> at <i>CEAC</i> in Xiamen, China and at <i>Basekamp</i> in Philadelphia.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Per.huttner.portrait.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q3044911\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1}],\"lon\":-0.039722222222222,\"wikidata\":\"Q16334457\",\"lat\":51.533055555556,\"pageid\":41538640,\"ns\":0,\"type\":\"landmark\"},{\"dim\":10000,\"dist\":2298.7,\"title\":\"Hackney Marshes\",\"extract\":\"<p></p>\\n<p><b>Hackney Marshes</b> is an area of grassland on the western bank of the River Lea in the London Borough of Hackney. It was incorporated into the Lee Valley Park in 1967. It was originally a true marsh, but was extensively drained from Medieval times, and rubble was dumped here from buildings damaged by air raids during World War II.</p>\\n<p>The principal area of the marsh lies below Lea Bridge Road between the Old River Lea, and the Hackney Cut \\u2013 an artificial channel of the Lee Navigation, dug about 1770, to avoid a loop in the natural watercourse. The southern extent is marked by the A12; although the industrial land around Hackney Wick Stadium was originally an extension of the marsh, it now forms a part of the Olympic Park for the 2012 Summer Olympics.</p>\\n<p>Hackney Marsh is one of the largest areas of common land in Greater London, with 136.01 hectares (336.1 acres) of protected commons.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>The marsh</h3>\\n<p>The River itself was always an important waterway, being navigable to Hertfordshire; the Marsh was formed by the periodic flooding of the river, and so formed useful pasture, but could not be occupied permanently. Before the 10th century, the estuary of the river came as far as Hackney Wick, crossed at Old Ford. Marsh Road, the continuation of Homerton High Street, led to the marshes, and thence to Temple Mills. The Romans appear to have built a significant stone causeway across the marshes here; a periodical, the <i>Ambulator</i> of 1774, noted</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><i>there have been discovered within the last few years the remains of a great causeway of stone, which, by the Roman coins found there, would appear to have been one of the famous highways made by the Romans</i></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The river forms a natural boundary, so in 527\\u00a0AD it formed the boundary between the Saxon kingdoms of Essex and Middlesex. In the 9th century, it formed a part of the Danelaw boundary and reputedly, King Alfred stranded an invading Viking fleet here in 895\\u00a0AD. This was achieved by draining the river where it met the River Thames, but the increased drainage affected river navigability, until it was restored in the 17th century.</p>\\n<p>By medieval times, both sides had become counties in England, and attempts were made to control the flow of water through the marshes. Mills were established including the Knights Templar mill at Temple Mills. Much of the marsh was 'owned' by the Templars and used for pasture. When the Templars were abolished, the land passed to the Knights Hospitaller, and thence to the Crown during the Reformation, when monastic lands were seized. At this time, much of the land was associated with the Hackney village of Lower Homerton and with the large manor house at Hackney Wick.</p>\\n<p>Around 1770, the river was straightened by the construction of the Hackney Cut, now forming the eastern extent of the marsh. The natural watercourse passes to the east over the Middlesex Filter Beds Weir, just below Lea Bridge Road. A nature reserve occupies the former Middlesex Filter beds on the island between the two watercourses.</p>\\n<p>By 1795, the former Templar mills were being used for preparing lead (submerged in urine, and heated by decaying cow dung, the lead was converted to lead oxide, and then finely ground to form a pigment for white, yellow and red lead paint). A new watermill was established on the Crown land of the marshes by Prince Rupert for an improved method of boring guns, however the secret died with him in 1682 and the enterprise collapsed.</p>\\n<p>At the end of the 19th century Hackney suffered from increased demand for building land, both for housing and to extend the factories in Homerton. The marshes had always suffered periodic flooding from the Lea but with the introduction of mains sewerage a flood relief sewer was constructed beneath the marshes. Most common and Lammas lands were then preserved by an Act of Parliament and passed to the control of the Metropolitan Board of Works, but the marsh remained excluded from the MBW scheme because many of the lammas rights were still exercised, predominantly grazing. This was a period of increasing arguments between landowners and groups, such as the Eton Manor Mission, who were trying to use the marsh for recreation. The 337 acres (1.36\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) of marshes were finally preserved by the London County Council in 1890, by purchasing the rights and landowners' interests for \\u00a375,000. They opened to the public in 1893 and were formally dedicated in 1894. The LCC undertook further flood prevention, straightening some of the bends in the River by introducing four 'cuts', the old channels being retained to form islands.</p>\\n\\n<p>There were few houses on the marshes, but a notable exception was the White House Inn, by a bridge on the old road to Leyton. Originally built as part of a Lea fishery scheme, the pub is now long gone but a bridge remains, rebuilt to supply anti-aircraft batteries during World War II.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><i>In the Marshes towards Hackney Wick were low public houses, the haunt of highwaymen and their Dulcineas. Dick Turpin was a constant guest at the \\\"White House,\\\" or \\\"Tyler's Ferry,\\\" near Joe Sowter's cock-pit at Temple Mills; and few police-officers were bold enough to approach the spot</i>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Small areas of the marsh have been taken for housing and sports fields and others added. 35.5 acres (144,000\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>) were taken in 1915 to build the 'National Projectile Factory'; after World War I, in 1922 this site was used to create the Mabley Green recreation ground. A further 22.5 acres (91,000\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>) were taken in 1937 for the building of the Kingsmead Estate. The Lesney die cast model factory was built on the Homerton side of the Lee Navigation in the 1940s, having success for many years with their <i>Matchbox</i> brand. The factory was a major local employer and closed in 1990.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Sport</h3>\\n<p>In 1881, men from Homerton College, then still in the London area, founded the Glyn Cricket Club. Members of the cricket club then decided to form a football section to keep fit during the winter months, this football section was to become the famous Clapton Orient Football Club which for thirty years played its home games at Millfields Road Stadium (1900\\u20131930). In 1946 the Club was renamed Leyton Orient and their home ground is now the Matchroom Stadium in Brisbane Road, Leyton, E10 5NF. Today the marshes provide many pleasant walks, in reach of the inner city, but the most famous use of Hackney Marshes is for Sunday league football, with 88 full-size football pitches marked out. On a typical Sunday, over 100 matches are played by amateur teams in several local leagues. This led in 2006 to a dispute between the London Borough of Hackney and Nike, Inc. over the company's use of the borough logo on their sportswear. The dispute was settled with payment of \\u00a3300,000 going to support local youth sports groups.</p>\\n<p>One of the most well known matches to be played on the marshes is games from The Hackney &amp; Leyton League</p>\\n<h3>London Olympics 2012</h3>\\n\\n<p>Part of the London Olympic park for the Summer Olympics of 2012 was built on Hackney Marshes. This caused some controversy with local residents' groups, who expressed concerns that East Marsh was to be tarmacked and used as a disabled coach park for the games. This was a temporary measure and restoration of the pitches has commenced -although it is behind schedule and unlikely to open in time for the start of the 2013 football season.</p>\\n<p>Arena Fields, however, was lost to the Olympic Park and its site will become part of the legacy Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park permanently. This area is to be replaced by parkland of comparable size and value on the Hackney side at the end of the 2012 Summer Olympics. It will not be possible to reinstate the loss of mature and varied trees or to compensate for the disruption caused to wildlife by construction.</p>\\n<p>The natural course of the River Lea forms the borough boundary with Waltham Forest and Newham (except for East Marsh, which lies between the river and Temple Mills). The Olympic plans included upgrading this watercourse and improving public access. The Olympic Park lies south of the A12, on industrial land around the former Hackney Stadium.</p>\\n<h2>Music, literature and film</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>The celebrated cockney music hall performer Gus Elen sang a song entitled <i>If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses In Between</i> which included the following chorus:</li>\\n</ul><blockquote>\\n<p><i>Oh it really is a wery pretty garden<br>\\nAnd Chingford to the eastward could be seen;<br>\\n'Wiv a ladder and some glasses,<br>\\nYou could see to 'Ackney Marshes,<br>\\nIf it wasn't for the 'ouses in between.</i></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<ul><li>In 1977, a 15 minute film was made celebrating the football on the marshes, by John Smith, and adapted for television the following year.</li>\\n<li>In 1997, Nike presented a selection of Premiership players turning out for the Sunday League teams to the soundtrack of Blur's \\\"Parklife\\\".</li>\\n<li>The 2005 film <i>Bullet Boy</i> (Saul Dibb) used the marshes and local streets as a location.</li>\\n<li>Radio 1's Hackney Weekend was held here on the marshes on 23 and 24 June 2012. with acts such as Jay-Z, Rihanna, will.i.am, Florence + The Machine, Leona Lewis and Plan B all performing across the two days.</li>\\n</ul><h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Transport and locale</h2>\\n<h3>Railway stations</h3>\\n<p>The area is not well served by transport, although boasts many buses. Access to the Olympic Park is intended to be served by Stratford.</p>\\n<p>At 20 minutes walk, the nearest London Overground station is Hackney Wick. At about 30 minutes walk, the nearest London Underground stations are Leyton and Stratford. Stratford International is also a Eurostar and National Rail station.

He played for Auxerre, Martigues, Marseille, Bordeaux, Montpellier, N\\u00eemes and Leeds United before ending his career at Manchester United where he won four Premier League titles in five years and two League and FA Cup Doubles.</p>\\n<p>Cantona is often regarded as having played a key role in the revival of Manchester United as a footballing force in the 1990s and he enjoys iconic status at the club. He wore the number 7 shirt at Manchester United. Cantona is affectionately nicknamed by Manchester United fans as \\\"King Eric\\\", and was voted as Manchester United's greatest ever player by <i>Inside United</i> magazine. Set against his footballing achievements was a poor disciplinary record for much of his career, including a conviction for assault on a fan in 1995, although his disciplinary record was much improved after he returned from his eight-month suspension right up to his retirement as a player two years later.</p>\\n<p>Following his retirement from football in 1997, he took up a career in cinema and had a role in the 1998 film <i>Elizabeth</i>, starring Cate Blanchett, the 2008 film <i>French Film</i>, and the 2009 film <i>Looking for Eric</i>. In 2010, he d\\u00e9buted as a stage actor in <i>Face au Paradis</i>, a French play directed by his wife, Rachida Brakni.</p>\\n<p>On 19 January 2011, Cantona joined the revived New York Cosmos as Director of Soccer.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Although it has been suggested that he was born in Paris, Cantona was actually born in Marseille, to Albert Cantona, a nurse and a painter, and \\u00c9l\\u00e9onore Raurich, a dressmaker. The family home was a cave in one of the hills in the Les Caillols area of Marseille, between the city's 11th and <i>12th arrondissements</i>, and it was rumoured to have been used as a look-out post for the German Army, towards the end of the Second World War. The site was chosen in the mid-1950s by Cantona's paternal grandmother, Lucienne, whose husband, Joseph, was a stonemason. By the time Cantona was born in 1966, the hillside cave had become little more than a room in the family's house, which was now up to a liveable standard. Cantona has two brothers, Jean-Marie, who is four years older; and Jo\\u00ebl, who is 17 months younger.</p>\\n<p>Cantona came from a family of immigrants: his paternal grandfather, Joseph, had immigrated to Marseille from Sardinia, while his mother's parents had been Catalan separatists. Pere Raurich, Cantona's maternal grandfather, was fighting the armies of General Franco in the Spanish Civil War in 1938 when he suffered a serious injury to his liver, and he had to retreat to France for medical treatment with his wife Paquita. The Raurichs stayed in Saint-Priest, Ard\\u00e8che, before settling in Marseille.</p>\\n<h2>Career</h2>\\n<h3>Early career</h3>\\n<p>Cantona began his football career with SO Caillolais, his local team and one that had produced such talent as Roger Jouve and had players such as Jean Tigana and Christophe Galtier within its ranks. Originally, Cantona began to follow in his father's footsteps and often played as a goalkeeper, but his creative instincts began to take over and he would play up front more and more often. In his time with SO Caillolais, Cantona played in more than 200 matches.</p>\\n<h3>France</h3>\\n<p>Cantona's first professional club was Auxerre, where he spent two years in the youth team before making his d\\u00e9but on 5 November 1983, in a 4\\u20130 league victory over Nancy.</p>\\n<p>In 1984 his footballing career was put on hold as he carried out his national service. After his discharge he was loaned out to Martigues in the French Second Division before rejoining Auxerre and signing a professional contract in 1986. His performances in the First Division were good enough to earn him his first full international cap when barely in his twenties. However, his disciplinary problems began in 1987 when he was fined for punching team mate Bruno Martini in the face.</p>\\n<p>The following year, Cantona was again in trouble because of a dangerous tackle on Nantes player Michel Der Zakarian, resulting in a three-month suspension, this was later reduced to a two-month suspension as his club Auxerre threatened to make the player unavailable for selection in the national team. He was part of the French under-21 side that won the 1988 U21 European Championship, scoring a hat-trick in a quarter-final against the England under-21 side in the process, and shortly after he transferred to Marseille for a French record fee (FF22m). Cantona had grown up as a Marseille fan.</p>\\n<p>In January 1989 during a friendly game against Torpedo Moscow he kicked the ball at the crowd, then ripped off and threw away his shirt after being substituted. His club responded by banning him for a month. Just a few months earlier, he had been banned from international matches for one year after insulting the national coach Henri Michel on TV.</p>\\n<p>Having struggled to settle at Marseille, Cantona moved to Bordeaux on a six-month loan and then to Montpellier on a year-long loan. At Montpellier, he was involved in a fight with team-mate Jean-Claude Lemoult and threw his boots in Lemoult's face. The incident led to six players demanding that Cantona be sacked. However, with the support of team-mates such as Laurent Blanc and Carlos Valderrama, the club retained his services, although they banned him from the ground for ten days. Cantona was instrumental as the team went on to win the French Cup and his form persuaded Marseille to take him back.</p>\\n<p>Back at Marseille, Cantona initially played well under coach Gerard Gili and his successor Franz Beckenbauer. However, the Marseille chairman Bernard Tapie was not satisfied with the results, and replaced Beckenbauer with Raymond Goethals; Cantona was continually at odds with Goethals and Tapie and, despite helping the team win the French Division 1 title, he was transferred to N\\u00eemes the following season.</p>\\n<p>In December 1991, during a match for N\\u00eemes he threw the ball at the referee, having been angered by one of his decisions. He was summoned to a disciplinary hearing by the French Football Federation and was banned for one month. Cantona responded by walking up to each member of the hearing committee in turn and calling him an idiot. His ban was increased to two months, and Cantona subsequently announced his retirement from football on 16 December 1991.</p>\\n<p>The French national team coach Michel Platini was a fan of Cantona, and persuaded him to make a comeback. On the advice of G\\u00e9rard Houllier as well as his psychoanalyst, he moved to England to restart his career, \\\"He [my psychoanalyst] advised me not to sign for Marseille and recommended that I should go to England.\\\"</p>\\n<h3>England</h3>\\n<p>Before going to Leeds United, Cantona was brought to England and was given a trial at Sheffield Wednesday. The Sheffield Wednesday manager Trevor Francis, however decided not to sign Cantona.</p>\\n<h4>Leeds United</h4>\\n<p>On 6 November 1991, after Liverpool's 3\\u20130 victory over Auxerre in a UEFA Cup Second Round second leg tie at Anfield, Liverpool manager Graeme Souness was met by Frenchman Michel Platini at the end of the game, who told him that Cantona was available for sale to Liverpool. Souness thanked Platini, but declined the offer, citing dressing room harmony as his reason. He also had a strong selection of forwards available to him at the time, including Ian Rush, John Barnes, Dean Saunders and Ronny Rosenthal, and would be joined by Paul Stewart and Nigel Clough in the following years.</p>\\n<p>He joined Yorkshire rivals Leeds United, where he was part of the team that won the final Football League First Division championship before it was replaced by the Premier League as the top division in English football. His transfer from N\\u00eemes cost Leeds \\u00a3900,000.</p>\\n<p>Cantona made 15 appearances for Leeds in their championship-winning season and despite only scoring three goals he was instrumental in their title success, primarily with assists for leading goalscorer Lee Chapman. He scored a hat-trick in the Charity Shield 4\\u20133 win over Liverpool in August 1992, and followed that with another in a 5\\u20130 league win over Tottenham Hotspur - the first ever in the newly branded Premier League. His hat-trick in the Charity Shield places him among the small elite group of players to have scored three or more goals in games at Wembley Stadium.</p>\\n<p>Cantona left Leeds for Manchester United for \\u00a31.2\\u00a0million on 26 November 1992. Leeds chairman Bill Fotherby had telephoned Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards to enquire about the availability of Denis Irwin. Edwards was in a meeting with United manager Alex Ferguson at the time, and both men agreed that Irwin was not for sale. Ferguson had identified that his team was in need of a striker, having recently made unsuccessful bids for David Hirst, Matt Le Tissier and Brian Deane, and instructed his chairman to ask Wilkinson whether Cantona was for sale. Fotherby had to consult with the manager Howard Wilkinson, but within a few days the deal was complete.</p>\\n<h4>Manchester United</h4>\\n<h5>1992\\u201393 season</h5>\\n<p>Cantona made his first appearance for Manchester United in a friendly match against Benfica in Lisbon to mark Eus\\u00e9bio's 50th birthday, wearing the number 10 shirt. He made his competitive d\\u00e9but as a second-half substitute against Manchester City at Old Trafford on 6 December 1992, wearing the number 12 shirt. United won 2\\u20131, though Cantona made little impact that day. He had arrived too late to register to play in United's 1\\u20130 win at Arsenal on 28 November, but was in the crowd at Highbury as his new team secured a vital win.</p>\\n<p>United's season had been disappointing up to Cantona's signing. They were falling behind the likes of big spending Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers in the race for the first Premier League title, as well as surprise challengers including Norwich City and Queen's Park Rangers. Goalscoring had been a problem since the halfway point of the previous season \\u2013 when it had cost them the league title as they suffered defeats or were held to draws at the hands of teams they had been expected to beat.</p>\\n<p>Brian McClair and Mark Hughes were off form, and summer signing Dion Dublin had broken his leg early in the season, ruling him out of action for six months. However, Cantona quickly settled into the team, not only scoring goals but also creating chances for the other players. His first United goal came in a 1\\u20131 draw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 19 December 1992, and his second came on Boxing Day in a 3\\u20133 draw against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough where they claimed a point after being 3\\u20130 down at half time. However, controversy was never far away, and on his return to Elland Road to play Leeds a few weeks later, he spat at a fan and was fined \\u00a31,000 by the FA.</p>\\n<p>In Cantona's first season at Old Trafford, United won the inaugural Premier League by 10 points \\u2013 winning the title for the first time since 1967. In doing so, he became the first player to win back-to-back English top division titles with different clubs. He had actually won a domestic league title with different clubs for three successive seasons, having helped Marseille win the French league title in 1991.</p>\\n<h5>1993\\u201394 season</h5>\\n<p>Manchester United retained the Premier League, and Cantona's two penalties helped them to a 4\\u20130 win over Chelsea in the FA Cup Final. He also collected a runners-up medal in the Football League Cup, which United lost 3\\u20131 to Aston Villa. He was also voted PFA Player of the Year for that season. However, the season was not without its moments of controversy; Cantona was sent off as Manchester United exited the Champions League against Galatasaray, and he was also dismissed in successive Premier League games, firstly against Swindon Town and then against Arsenal. The two successive red cards saw Cantona banned for five matches, including a FA Cup semi-final clash with Oldham Athletic, which United drew 1\\u20131. Cantona was available for the replay and helped them win 4\\u20131.</p>\\n<p>1993\\u201394 was the first season of squad numbers in the Premier League. Cantona was issued with the number 7 shirt, a squad number he kept for the rest of his career at United. However, squad numbers were not set for the UEFA Champions League matches and Cantona wore the number 9 shirt in the four fixtures home and away against Kispest Honved and Galatasaray.</p>\\n<p>On 19 December 1993, he put in one of his finest performances for United, scoring two against Aston Villa in a 3\\u20131 victory that put United 13 points clear at the top of the league.</p>\\n<h5>1994\\u201395 season \\u2013 Ban from football</h5>\\n<p>In the following season United looked to win a third successive league title, and for the first half of the season things went smoothly enough. The season began with a 2\\u20130 Wembley win over Blackburn Rovers in the Charity Shield, in which Cantona scored a penalty. Cantona frequently scored for United, who put intense pressure a Blackburn Rovers side that led the table for much of the season, particularly with a 4\\u20132 win at Ewood Park in late October, in which Cantona was on the scoresheet. He was also on the scoresheet the following month in a memorable 5\\u20130 derby win over Manchester City, and on 22 January he scored the winning goal in a 1\\u20130 home win over Blackburn that made the title race even tighter and brought Cantona's tally of league goals for that season to 12. He had also scored a further goal in an FA Cup third round win at Sheffield United.</p>\\n<p>However, on 25 January 1995 he was involved in an incident that attracted headlines and controversy worldwide. In an away match against Crystal Palace, Cantona was sent off by the referee for a kick on Palace defender Richard Shaw after Shaw had pulled his shirt. As he was walking towards the tunnel, Cantona launched a 'kung-fu' style kick into the crowd, directed at Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons, a fan who had run down 11 rows of stairs to confront and shout abuse at Cantona. Simmons was alleged to have used the words \\\"Fuck off back to France, you French motherfucker\\\". Cantona followed the infamous kick with a series of punches.</p>\\n<p>Cantona was arrested and convicted for assault, resulting in a two-week prison sentence. This was overturned in the appeal court and instead he was sentenced to 120 hours of community service. At a press conference called later, Cantona gave what is perhaps his most famous quotation. Cantona said, in a slow and deliberate manner: \\\"When the seagulls follow the trawler, it's because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea. Thank you very much\\\". He then got up from his seat and left.</p>\\n<p>In accordance with The Football Association's wishes, Manchester United fined Cantona \\u00a320,000 and suspended him for the remaining four months of the 1994\\u201395 season, which ruled him out of first-team action as United were still in the hunt for a second double.</p>\\n<p>The Football Association then increased the ban to eight months (up to and including 30 September 1995) and fined him a further \\u00a310,000. The FA Chief Executive Graham Kelly described his attack as \\\"a stain on our game\\\" that brought shame on football. FIFA then confirmed the suspension as worldwide, meaning that Cantona could not escape the ban by transferring to a foreign club. Manchester United also fined Cantona two weeks' wages and he was stripped of the French captaincy. He would never be selected for France again. His club eventually lost the Premier League title to Blackburn Rovers.</p>\\n<p>There had been media speculation that Cantona would leave English football when his ban finished, but Alex Ferguson persuaded him to stay in Manchester, despite interest from Italian club Inter Milan (who had managed to lure his team mate Paul Ince to Italy that year).</p>\\n<p>Even after signing his new contract, Cantona was frustrated by the terms of his ban, and on 8 August, he handed in a request for his contract to be terminated, as he no longer wanted to play football in England. This came after United had been censured by the FA for fielding Cantona in a match against another club at the club's training ground, which was defined as a friendly match despite the club organising the match as being within the context of training - as his suspension allowed him to play in this type of match only. The request was turned down and two days later, following a meeting in Paris with Alex Ferguson, he declared that he would remain at the club.</p>\\n<p>In 2011, Cantona admitted that the infamous attack on the Crystal Palace supporter was \\\"a great feeling\\\" and a memory he is happy for fans to treasure, but \\\"... it was a mistake\\\".</p>\\n<h5>1995\\u201396 season</h5>\\n<p>In his comeback game against Liverpool on 1 October 1995, Cantona set up a goal for Nicky Butt two minutes into the game, and then scored a penalty after Ryan Giggs was fouled to secure a point for United in a 2\\u20132 home draw against their great rivals. However, eight months without competitive football had taken its toll and Cantona struggled for form prior to Christmas \\u2013 by 24 December, the gap between Manchester United and league leaders Newcastle United had increased to 10 points.</p>\\n<p>A goal by Cantona in United's league clash with West Ham United at Upton Park triggered a 10-match winning run in the league. Over the second half of the season, several more United games ended in 1\\u20130 wins with Cantona scoring the only goal, though it was actually a draw (in which Cantona equalised) with Queen's Park Rangers on 9 March which saw United overtake Newcastle on goal difference for the first time. They stayed there for the rest of the season, and on the final day of the season United beat Middlesbrough 3\\u20130 at the Riverside Stadium to win their third title in four seasons.</p>\\n<p>Manchester United also reached the 1996 FA Cup Final against Liverpool, and with regular captain Steve Bruce missing through injury, Cantona was named as captain. He then scored the only goal of the game in the 86th minute and became the first player from outside the British Isles to lift the FA Cup as captain; Manchester United became the first team to win \\\"the double\\\" twice.</p>\\n<h5>1996\\u201397 season</h5>\\n<p>Cantona was confirmed as United's captain for the 1996\\u201397 season following the departure of Steve Bruce to Birmingham City.</p>\\n<p>United retained the league in the 1996\\u201397 season; Cantona had won four league titles in five years with United (six in seven years including those won with Marseille and Leeds United), the exception being the 1994\\u201395 season which he had missed the second half of through suspension.</p>\\n<p>At the end of the season he announced that he was retiring from football at the age of 30. His final competitive game came against West Ham on 11 May 1997, and his final appearance before retiring was five days later on 16 May in a testimonial for David Busst (the player whose career had been ended by an injury suffered against United the previous year) against Coventry City at Highfield Road.</p>\\n<p>Cantona scored a total of 64 league goals for Manchester United, 11 in domestic cup competitions, and 5 in the Champions League, bringing his tally to 80 goals in less than five years.</p>\\n<h5>After leaving</h5>\\n<p>In 1998, the Football League, as part of its centenary season celebrations, included Cantona on its list of 100 League Legends. Cantona's achievements in the English League were further marked in 2002 when he was made an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame.</p>\\n<p>In his 1999 autobiography <i>Managing My Life</i>, Alex Ferguson claimed that Cantona had informed him of his decision to retire from playing within 24 hours of United's Champions League semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund, though the decision was not made public for almost a month afterwards. During that time, there had been speculation about his future at United, including talk of a move to Real Zaragoza of Spain.</p>\\n<p>Returning to Britain in 2003 to pick up the Overseas Player of the Decade Award at the Premier League 10 Seasons Awards, Cantona said of his premature retirement, \\\"When you quit football it is not easy, your life becomes difficult. I should know because sometimes I feel I quit too young. I loved the game but I no longer had the passion to go to bed early, not to go out with my friends, not to drink, and not to do a lot of other things, \\u00adthe things I like in life.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In 2004, Cantona was quoted as saying, \\\"I'm so proud the fans still sing my name, but I fear tomorrow they will stop. I fear it because I love it. And everything you love, you fear you will lose.\\\"</p>\\n<p>He was interviewed in the Number 7's issue of <i>United Magazine</i> in August 2006 stating he will only come back to Manchester United as 'Number 1' (meaning not return as assistant manager or coach) and would create a team like no other and play the way he thinks football should be played.</p>\\n<p>Cantona opposed the Glazer takeover of Manchester United, and has stated that he will not return to the club, even as a manager, while the Glazer family is in charge. This came as a disappointment to the many United fans who voted him as their choice for United's next manager in a survey over the summer of 2000. At this stage, it had been expected that manager Sir Alex Ferguson would retire in 2002, but the manager later had a change of heart and would go on to manage until his retirement in 2013.</p>\\n<p>In July 2008, it was reported by the <i>Sunday Express</i> that Cantona had been having second thoughts, with a \\\" close friend \\\" of Cantona's allegedly revealing: \\\"Eric does fancy the idea of helping out with the coaching at a club like Manchester United... He has been enjoying himself appearing in and directing films and being involved in beach soccer but has always wanted to help produce a team in his style and knows that Sir Alex Ferguson would encourage him\\\".</p>\\n<p>In March 2014 Cantona was arrested and cautioned for common assault.</p>\\n<h3>French national team</h3>\\n<p>Cantona was given his full international d\\u00e9but against West Germany in August 1987 by national team manager Henri Michel. In September 1988, angered after being dropped from the national team, Cantona referred to Michel as a \\\"bag of shit\\\" in a post-match TV interview and was indefinitely banned from all international matches. However, Michel was sacked shortly after that having failed to qualify for the 1990 World Cup.</p>\\n<p>The new coach was Michel Platini and one of his first acts was to recall Cantona. Platini stated that whilst he was coach, Cantona would be selected for France as long as he was playing competitive top-class football; it was Platini who had initiated Cantona's move to England to restart his career. France qualified for Euro 1992 held in Sweden, but failed to win a single game despite the striking partnership of Cantona and Jean-Pierre Papin. Platini resigned after the finals to be replaced by G\\u00e9rard Houllier.</p>\\n<p>Under Houllier, France failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup in the U.S. after losing the final game 2\\u20131 at home to Bulgaria when a draw would have sufficed. Houllier resigned and Aim\\u00e9 Jacquet took over.</p>\\n<p>Jacquet began to rebuild the national team in preparation for Euro 96 and appointed Cantona as captain. Cantona remained captain until the Selhurst Park incident in January 1995. The suspension which resulted from this incident also prevented him from playing in international matches.</p>\\n<p>By the time Cantona's suspension had been completed, he had lost his role as the team's playmaker to Zin\\u00e9dine Zidane, as Jacquet had revamped the squad with some new players. Cantona, Papin and David Ginola lost their places in the squad and were never selected for the French team again, thus missing Euro 96. Though there was media criticism about Cantona's omission, as he was playing his best football in the Premier League, Jacquet stated that the team had done well without Cantona, and that he wanted to keep faith with the players who had taken them so far. The decision was vindicated as Les Bleus subsequently won the World Cup in 1998.</p>\\n<p>To this day, Cantona still harbours resentment for the people at the head of his national team but also admiration for his adopted football country; at Euro 2004 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup, he supported England and not France.</p>\\n<h3>Mass media</h3>\\n<p>In 1992, Cantona endorsed two video games, <i>Eric Cantona Football Challenge</i> and <i>Eric Cantona Football Challenge: Goal! 2</i>.</p>\\n<p>He focused his later career mostly as an actor in French cinema, having had his first role as a rugby player in <i>Le bonheur est dans le pr\\u00e9</i>, shot during his 1995 suspension from football. In the late 1990s, he accepted a role as a French ambassador in the English film <i>Elizabeth</i> (1998). In 2002 he directed a short film, <i>Apporte-moi ton amour</i>. He guest-starred as a mysterious barroom philosopher in independent British film <i>Jack Says</i>, released to DVD in September 2008. He co-starred as director Thierry Grimandi in <i>French Film</i> (2009), and is co-producer and a lead actor in Ken Loach's Palme D'or nominated film <i>Looking for Eric</i> (2009). He also stars as The Corsican in the Danish western <i>The Salvation</i>, which premiered at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival on the 17th May 2014.</p>\\n<p>Since his retirement from professional football, Cantona has appeared in numerous European television advertisements, especially for sportswear company Nike. Cantona made cameos in two commercials, one starred the Brazil national team playing football in an airport, and the other involved the national teams of Brazil and Portugal, respectively.</p>\\n<p>In a worldwide advertising campaign during the run-up to the 2002 World Cup, he starred as the organiser of \\\"underground\\\" games, (branded by Nike as \\\"Scorpion KO\\\") between footballers, such as Thierry Henry, Hidetoshi Nakata, Francesco Totti, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Lu\\u00eds Figo. In an earlier UK Nike commercial, he appeared playing \\\"amateur\\\" football on Hackney Marshes with other stars including Ian Wright, David Seaman, Steve McManaman and Robbie Fowler. In a Nike campaign in the advance of the 2006 World Cup, Cantona appears as the lead spokesman for the Joga Bonito organization, an association attempting to eliminate acting and fake play from football. He also starred in a Eurostar commercial in 1996, and an Irish EuroMillions advertisement in 2004. In 2009, he featured in a British television advertisement for a new model of the Renault Laguna.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Eric_Cantona_Cannes_2009.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q170328\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":23533932,\"title\":\"Stephen Gill (photographer)\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Stephen Gill</b> (born in Bristol, 1971) is a British experimental, conceptual and documentary photographer, and artist. He is known for his photographs of East London; his publication of his own books; and his attention to detail of his books as art objects in themselves. He works where he lives and includes this place in his books in novel ways other than just the photographic depiction. His 2005 book <i>Hackney Wick</i> received acclaim.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Life and work</h2>\\n<p>Gill's father, a keen photographer, taught him to develop and print his own pictures in the darkroom in their attic. In 1985, while still at school, he went to work for a local, Bristol-based photography company, copying and restoring old photographs and helping to take family portraits. In 1992 he enrolled in the photography foundation course at Filton College in Bristol. Two years later, he began working full-time in a one-hour photography lab. He then went to work at the Magnum Photos agency in London, first as an intern and then full-time. In 1997 he left Magnum to become a freelance photographer, working on commissions to shoot portraits for newspaper supplements, and editorial, whilst continuing to make a variety of personal photographic series. He lived and worked in Hackney, East London, until 2014.</p>\\n<p>In January 2003 Gill bought a basic 1960s box camera made by Coronet for 50 pence at Hackney Wick market, near where he lived. The camera had a plastic lens, and it lacked focus or exposure controls. The market was a large ad-hoc car boot sale on the site of the old Hackney Wick Stadium, a decommissioned dog racing track near Hackney Marshes. He used the camera to photograph people and the environment at the market over the next two years. As well as what, and how, Gill photographed, the pictures are also distinguished by the unpredictable and poorly rendered images from the camera. \\\"In the late \\u201990s and early 2000s the idea of quality and technique became so important\\u2026 and conversations around photography were often very much about dpi and megapixels.

He has had a lengthy career, beginning with ghost-writing <i>Cliff Bastin Remembers</i>, the autobiography of his hero, at 19. A noted critique of the British style of sportswriting in <i>Encounter</i> magazine in the late 1950s lamented the lack of depth compared to the American style of Red Smith, Damon Runyon or A. J. Liebling. As a journalist he spent nearly 30 years as a football correspondent for <i>The Sunday Times</i>, to which he is still a contributor, and has contributed to <i>World Soccer</i> magazine for over 15 years in print and online; he currently contributes a weekly column to the website covering a range of issues. In the 1960s and 1970s, Glanville was a member of the jury which awards the yearly Ballon d'Or France Football (or European Footballer of the Year award. In addition has written for <i>The People</i> and more recently contributed several obituaries of prominent players to <i>The Guardian</i>.</p>\\n<p>In addition, his work has been seen in publications such as <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and the <i>New Statesman</i>, and the prominent American Football writer Paul Zimmerman has called him \\\"the greatest football writer of all time.\\\"</p>\\n<p>He spent much of his career based in Italy and has been seen as one of the leading authorities on Italian football as a result. Whilst based in both Florence and Rome, he wrote regularly for the Italian daily <i>Corriere Dello Sport</i>, as well as occasional pieces for <i>La Stampa</i> and <i>Corriere della Sera</i>.</p>\\n<p>Glanville is noted for taking a critical view of many issues, often in contrast to the typical British sportswriter. For example, since its formation he has criticised the Premier League as the \\\"Greed is Good League\\\" and FIFA president Sepp Blatter is referred to as \\\"Sepp (50 ideas a day, 51 bad) Blatter\\\" relating to his comments on women's football and the introduction of the silver goal (see Blatter article for more details).</p>\\n<p>During the 1960s, Glanville worked as a writer for the satirical BBC TV programme <i>That Was The Week That Was</i> and wrote the screenplay for <i>Goal!</i>, the BAFTA award winning official film of the 1966 World Cup. As a novelist he has written mostly about football and life in Italy, with his 1956 novel <i>Along the Arno</i> particularly well received by critics. He has also written <i>The Story of the World Cup</i>, a frequently updated history of the FIFA tournament.</p>\\n<p>Glanville is a lifelong supporter of Arsenal F.C..</p>\\n<p>From the mid 1960s to the 1980s Brian Glanville organised and ran his own very successful (largely) amateur football team, Chelsea Casuals, which, depending on the quality of the opposition, comprised a motley collection of actors, artists, radio, TV and newspaper journalists, university graduates and undergraduates (mainly drawn from the LSE), friends (occasionally professional soccer players and from other sports including cricket. Anecdotes in his book of short stories <i>The King of Hackney Marshes</i> (1965) drew heavily on experiences gained not only from games on the Hackney Marshes but also at Wormwood Scrubs playing fields, the Chelsea Hospital ground and elsewhere. His novel <i>The Rise of Gerry Logan</i> (1963, 1965) predated the rise of the ex-professional radio and TV punditry of the <i>Saint and Greavsie</i>/Alan Hansen/Andy Gray variety.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q3644454\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1}],\"lon\":-0.03,\"wikidata\":\"Q2777438\",\"lat\":51.557,\"pageid\":669553,\"ns\":0,\"type\":\"city\"},{\"dim\":100000,\"dist\":2333.9,\"title\":\"London Borough of Hackney\",\"extract\":\"<p><b>The London Borough of Hackney</b> /\\u02c8h\\u00e6kni/ is a London borough in North East London.</p>\\n<p>Hackney is bounded by Islington to the west, Haringey to the north, Waltham Forest to the north-east, Tower Hamlets to the south-east and the City of London to the south-west. Much of Hackney maintains its inner-city character and in places like Dalston large housing estates now sit side-by-side with gated communities. In South Hackney, near Victoria Park, there is terraced Victorian and Edwardian housing.</p>\\n<p>The historical and administrative heart of Hackney is the area roughly extending north from Mare Street and surrounding the Church of St John-at-Hackney; known as Hackney Central. To the north of the borough are Upper Clapton and Lower Clapton, Stamford Hill and Stoke Newington. To the east is the large open space of Hackney Marshes and the districts of Hackney Wick and Homerton. Light industries in the area around the River Lea employ over 3,000 people and some were also used for the 2012 Summer Olympics.</p>\\n<p>There are 1,300 listed buildings in Hackney, including the iconic Grade II* Hackney Empire, Tudor Sutton House, and the Grade I medieval St Augustine's Tower. The Borough contains 25 conservation areas including Clapton Square, and urban open-spaces including Clapton Common and Clissold Park. Conservation areas also protect large areas of Georgian and Victorian housing, and areas of industrial heritage.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n<p>The borough was formed in 1965 from the area of the earlier metropolitan boroughs of Hackney, Shoreditch and Stoke Newington. The new council included representative symbols of the predecessor boroughs in its new combined coat of arms: Shoreditch by three bells from Shoreditch Church; Stoke Newington by two trees bearing fruit; and Hackney by the Maltese Cross of the principal landowners of the parish in the Middle Ages. The shield is surmounted by a representation of St. Augustine's Tower.</p>\\n<p>The council displays, in Hackney Town Hall, a portrait of the Queen wearing the robes of the Most Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem, of which she is Patron.</p>\\n<p>The borough has a rich history; the Roman road, Ermine Street, forms the western edge of the borough. Most of the rest of the land was covered with open oak and hazel woodlands, with marshland around the rivers and streams that crossed the area. Hackney lay within the Catuvellauni tribal territory. The eastern boundary of the borough is marked by the River Lea. This was an ancient boundary between pre-Roman tribes, and in the Roman era, was tidal up to Hackney Wick and continued to be the boundary between the historic counties of Middlesex and Essex.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the Tudor period the lands of religious orders were seized by the Crown and put up for sale. Thus Hackney became a retreat for the nobility around Hackney Central and Homerton, including Henry VIII's Palace by Lea Bridge roundabout, where BSix Sixth Form College stands today. Sutton House, on Homerton High Street, is the oldest surviving dwelling in Hackney, originally built as <i>Bryck Place</i> for Sir Ralph Sadleir, a diplomat, in 1535. The village of Hackney flourished from the Tudor to late Georgian periods as a rural retreat. The first documented \\\"hackney coach\\\"\\u2014the forerunner of the more generic \\\"hackney carriage\\\"\\u2014operated in London in 1621. Current opinion is that the name \\\"hackney,\\\" to refer to a London taxi, is derived from the village name. (Hackney, through its historical fame for its horses and horse-drawn carriages, is also the root of the Spanish word <i>jaca</i>, a term used for a small breed of horse, and the Sardinian achetta horse.) Hackney's rural reputation brought to an end by the construction of the railway in the 1850s.</p>\\n\\n<p>London's first Tudor theatres were built at Shoreditch and the Gunpowder Plot was first exposed nearby in Hoxton too.</p>\\n<p>Notable residents from the 17th, 18th, and 19th Centuries included Robert Aske, William Cecil, Samuel Courtauld, Samuel Hoare, Joseph Priestley and Thomas Sutton.</p>\\n<p>Many grand houses stood in Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill, with the latter providing a haven for Hackney's many Orthodox Jewish residents from the 1930s. Alfred Hitchcock made many of his first films in Hoxton at the Gainsborough Studios in Poole Street.</p>\\n<p>After industrialisation, extensive post-war development and immigration, the area's many Georgian and Victorian terraces are being gentrified, warehouses are being converted and new apartments are being built. It was inner London's 'greenest borough' and London Transport's 'best bike borough 2006', with 62 parks and open spaces, covering 815 acres (3.3\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>). Seven Hackney parks have now achieved Green Flag status. One, Abney Park, became scheduled in 2009 as one of Britain's historic park and garden at risk from neglect and decay. Hackney Marshes play host to the largest collection of football pitches in Europe; and was the site of part of the 2012 Summer Olympics.</p>\\n<h2>Governance</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>The borough comprises two parliamentary constituencies: Hackney North and Stoke Newington (represented by Diane Abbott MP) and Hackney South and Shoreditch (represented by Meg Hillier MP); both are Privy Counsellors and Labour Party Members of Parliament. The borough is in the North East London Assembly constituency returning Jennette Arnold AM, as the directly elected Assembly Member. Hackney is part of the London constituency in the European Parliament.</p>\\n<p>Unlike most other English local authorities, the Borough is now governed by a directly-elected Mayor who is also the political leader of the Council. The Mayor\\u00a0\\u2013 currently Jules Pipe CBE\\u00a0\\u2013 is supported by a cabinet, councillors and a Speaker who fulfils the civic and ceremonial duties previously undertaken by the (non-political) mayor.</p>\\n<p>At the Hackney Council election on 6 May 2010 the Labour Party were returned with 50 Councillors; winning six additional seats. The Conservative Party forms the largest opposition party on the Council with four Councillors; and the Liberal Democrats have three.</p>\\n<p><i>City's councils get top ratings</i> (BBC News) Every ward remains among the 10% most deprived in the country, with 47% of children living in low income households.</p>\\n<p>Hackney has a reputation as one of the most crime-ridden London boroughs, and some of its streets have even been referred to as \\\"Murder Mile\\\", but cooperation between local police and council has resulted in the borough experiencing a bigger drop in crime than in any other London borough in the four-year period up to 2007 (28% reduction).</p>\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n<h3>Location</h3>\\n<p>The London Borough of Hackney is an Inner London Borough within Greater London. It is to the north-east of the City of London; and neighboured by the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, to the south; Islington to the west at Southgate Road; Haringey to the north. On the east, the River Lea forms the boundary with Waltham Forest; and to the south-east is Newham. Historically, the River Lea formed the boundary between the predecessor counties of Middlesex and Essex.</p>\\n<p>Hackney Town Hall is approximately 5 miles (8\\u00a0km) north-east of Charing Cross, St Pauls Cathedral being situated in between; and 3.8 miles (6.1\\u00a0km) from the GLA City Hall near Tower Bridge.</p>\\n<h3>Districts and postcodes</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>The most southerly district in the borough is Shoreditch, adjacent to the City. To the north-west, bordering Islington, the City, and north of Old Street is Hoxton. To the north of Shoreditch is Haggerston, north of the Regents Canal. Bethnal Green also forms of the southern parts of the borough, also this is formally and majoritised within neighbouring Tower Hamlets.</p>\\n<p>Settlements to the west of the borough followed the line of the former Ermine Street, with De Beauvoir Town\\u00a0\\u2014 a Victorian estate to the west of the (now) Kingsland Road. Further north, lie Dalston, Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill\\u00a0\\u2014 where the borough abuts Haringey.</p>\\n<p>A further group of settlements follow another north-south radial road, with South Hackney to the east of Cambridge Heath Road\\u00a0\\u2014 north of Victoria Park; and Hackney Central commencing at Mare Street. London Fields was formerly common land to the west of this place, but now forms a district in its own right. To the north, Homerton lies immediately east of the centre of Hackney. The River Lea forms the borough's eastern boundary. Hackney Wick, the Hackney Marshes, Lower and Upper Clapton all lie along this eastern boundary.</p>\\n<p>Postal districts were assigned to the former parts of the borough in 1857/8. Most of the borough would originally have been covered by a planned 'NE' postal district, but this was abolished in 1866. Most of the borough is covered by the eastern postal district, but Shoreditch constitutes five separate postcodes. Areas to the west of Kingsland Road and in the north of the borough are predominantly covered by the northern postal district.</p>\\n<p>Traditionally, much of the borough was and remains considered as a part of East London, with Hoxton and Shoreditch being part of the East End of London. In the 2008 revision of the London Plan, the borough was officially reassigned to the north London sub-region for administrative purposes.</p>\\n<h3>Topography</h3>\\n<p>The London Borough of Hackney covers an area of 19.06 square kilometres (7.4\\u00a0sq\\u00a0mi). Its primary geographic feature is the course of the River Lea; and the associated River Lee Navigation, which passes through Hackney Cut\\u00a0\\u2014 an artificial channel of the Lea built in 1770 across the Hackney Marshes to straighten a meander of the natural river. A tributary of the Lea, Hackney Brook was fully culverted in 1860 by the Metropolitan Board of Works.</p>\\n<p>The New River passes through the borough close to Finsbury Park and flows towards Islington. The Regents Canal also crosses the borough to the south of De Beauvoir Town in the west, joining the Hertford Union Canal below Victoria Park.</p>\\n<p>Within the Borough, the land rises westward from the Lea reaching 30 metres (98\\u00a0ft) above sea level at Clapton Common and Stamford Hill. The area around Victoria Park, in the south of the borough lies about 15 metres (49\\u00a0ft) above sea level. At Spring Hill, in Upper Clapton the road descends sharply from 25 metres (82\\u00a0ft) to only 10 metres (33\\u00a0ft) at High Hill Ferry, on the Lee Navigation.</p>\\n<h3>Geology</h3>\\n<p>The Lea and Hackney Marshes are underlain by alluvium soils; and the higher ground between Homerton and Stamford Hill is formed on a widening bed of London Clay. Brickearth deposits are within tongues of clay extending beneath Clapton Common, Stamford Hill and Stoke Newington High Street. The centre and south western districts lie on river terrace deposits of Taplow Gravel. Victoria Park and Well Street Common lie on flood plain gravel.</p>\\n<h3>Climate</h3>\\n<p>This data was taken between 1971 and 2000 at the nearest national weather station in Greenwich; around 7 miles (11.3\\u00a0km) south of Hackney Town Hall:</p>\\n<p><br></p>\\n<h2>Demography</h2>\\n<p>In 1801, the civil parishes that form the modern borough had a total population of 14,609. This rose steadily throughout the 19th century, as the district became built up; reaching 95,000 in the middle of that century. When the railways arrived the rate of population growth increased\\u00a0\\u2014 reaching nearly 374,000 by the turn of the century. This increase in population peaked before World War I, falling slowly in the aftermath until World War II began an exodus from London towards the new towns under the Abercrombie Plan for London (1944). The population is now rising again, and the 2001 census gives Hackney a population of 202,824.</p>\\n<p>The population is ethnically diverse. Of the resident population, 89,490 (41%) people describe themselves as White British. 30,978 (14%) are in other White ethnic groups, 63,009 (29%) are Black or Black British, 20,000 (9%) are Asian or Asian British, 8,501 (4%) describe themselves as 'Mixed', and 6,432 (3%) as Chinese or Other.</p>\\n\\n<p>There is also a large Turkish and Kurdish population resident in Hackney. Turkish and Kurdish communities are located in all parts of the borough, though there is a greater concentration in north and central Hackney.</p>\\n<p>132,931 (66%) of the resident population were British born. A further 10,095 (5%) were born in other parts of Europe, and the remaining 59,798 (29%) born elsewhere in the world.</p>\\n<p>The 2001 census also shows Christianity is the biggest religion in Hackney, with 44% of residents identifying Christian; 18% identified as Muslim, 4% Jewish, and 3% belonged to other religions. A further 19% stated no religion, and 12% did not state a response. By the 2011 census, residents identifying themselves as Christian fell to 38.6%, whilst those with no religion rose to 28.2%. Judaism had a modest increase, Islam had a small increase, and Hinduism made a slight drop.</p>\\n<p>32% of households are owner\\u2013occupied.</p>\\n<p>The largest rise of ethnic groups between 2001 and 2011 was 'Other', which increased by 222%. This was followed by 'Mixed', which rose by 84%.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 2002, the borough entered into a ten-year contract with the <i>Learning Trust</i>, an independent collaborative body that organises education for Hackney's 27,000 pupils in over 70 schools, nurseries and play centres. The trust was set up in response to an OFSTED report that identified failings in the then existing system. Two of London's most successful City Academies are in Hackney with another two in development and plans to rebuild or renovate every other Hackney school by 2016.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<p>Hackney is hardly served by London Underground services: Only Manor House, located on its extreme north-western fringe on the boundary with Haringey, though Old Street sits only a few metres south-west of Hackney in Islington.</p>\\n<p>However, two London Overground lines serve Hackney: the North London Line crosses from west to east while the East London Line runs from Highbury &amp; Islington and passes through Dalston Junction and on south through Haggerston, Hoxton, Shoreditch towards destinations south of the River Thames, including Clapham Junction, Crystal Palace, Croydon, and New Cross.</p>\\n<p>Additionally National Rail's Lea Valley Lines also pass through Hackney, with stations at London Fields, Hackney Downs, Rectory Road, Stoke Newington, Stamford Hill, and Clapton.</p>\\n<p>It is proposed that Crossrail 2, the 'Chelsea-Hackney Line', would provide a direct Underground service to Hackney Central, Dalston and Homerton, although it is currently undecided whether this would be built as London Underground or main line specifications.</p>\\n\\n<h3>London Overground</h3>\\n<p><b>North London Line</b> Travelling west to east\\u00a0\\u2014 nearest London Overground stations are <i>Dalston Kingsland</i>, <i>Hackney Central</i>, <i>Homerton</i> and <i>Hackney Wick</i></p>\\n<p><b>East London Line</b> Travelling north to south\\u00a0\\u2014 nearest London Overground stations are <i>Dalston Junction</i>, <i>Haggerston</i>, <i>Hoxton</i> and <i>Shoreditch High Street</i></p>\\n<h3>Lea Valley Lines</h3>\\n<p>These stations are served by Abellio Greater Anglia:</p>\\n<ul><li>Stamford Hill railway station</li>\\n<li>Stoke Newington railway station</li>\\n<li>Rectory Road railway station</li>\\n<li>Clapton railway station</li>\\n<li>Hackney Downs railway station</li>\\n<li>London Fields railway station</li>\\n</ul><h3>Travel to work</h3>\\n<p>In March 2011, the main forms of transport that residents used to travel to work were: bus, minibus or coach, 16.9% of all residents aged 16\\u201374; underground, metro, light rail, tram, 9.2%; bicycle, 9.2%; on foot, 7.5%; driving a car or van, 7.1%; train, 4.6%; work mainly at or from home, 3.5%.</p>\\n<h2>Notable associated people</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Notable attractions and institutions</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>Abney Park Cemetery \\u2013 overgrown Victorian cemetery and Nature Reserve</li>\\n<li>Arcola Theatre \\u2013 studio theatre</li>\\n<li>National Centre of Circus Arts \\u2013 circus school</li>\\n<li>Geffrye Museum \\u2013 decorative arts museum</li>\\n<li>Hackney Empire \\u2013 theatre</li>\\n<li>Hoxton Hall \\u2013 community centre and performance space</li>\\n<li>Newington Green Unitarian Church \\u2013 London's oldest nonconformist place of worship</li>\\n<li>St John's Hoxton \\u2013 Anglican church (where \\\"Amazing Grace\\\" was written)</li>\\n<li>Shoreditch Town Hall</li>\\n<li>Sutton House \\u2013 Heritage house and museum</li>\\n<li>The Towers of Hackney</li>\\n<li>Transition Gallery \\u2013 contemporary art project space</li>\\n<li>Victoria Miro Gallery \\u2013 contemporary art gallery</li>\\n<li>Vortex Jazz Club \\u2013 live jazz venue</li>\\n<li>White Cube \\u2013 contemporary commercial art gallery</li>\\n</ul><h2>Twinned towns</h2>\\n<p>The London Borough of Hackney has formal twinning arrangements with:</p>\\n<p>And an informal twinning with</p>\\n<dl><dd> Alexandra, South Africa.</dd>\\n</dl><p>The borough also has informal links with South Africa, Turkey, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

Hope lived in Hackney most of his life, but now lives in his place of birth, Antigua. He represented Great Britain at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Biography</h2>\\n<p>Maurice Hope moved at a very young age to England. In England, where boxing is a popular sport, he learned how to box. Hope's aptitude towards boxing was evident early in childhood; he began to train as a very young boy.</p>\\n<p>After being a star amateur fighter, Hope made his professional debut on 18 June 1973, defeating John Smith by decision in eight rounds at Nottingham.</p>\\n<p>On Hope's second fight, held on 25 September of that year, he scored his first knockout win, a victory in three rounds over Len Gibbs in Shoreditch. Hope won his first four professional fights.</p>\\n<p>On 21 November, he suffered his first defeat, being beaten by Mickey Flynn over eight rounds by decision.</p>\\n<p>After that loss, Hope went on to win five fights in a row, four by knockout, before winning his first regional belt, when he beat Larry Paul, 5 November 1974, by a knockout in round eight of a fifteen round bout, at Wolverhampton, to win the British Jr. Middleweight title.</p>\\n<p>Hope then won three more fights, including one (a fourth round knockout of Don Cobbs on 11 February 1975 at Royal Albert Hall) which was refereed by legendary referee Harry Gibs, who also oversaw the refereeing of the Wilfredo G\\u00f3mez-Carlos Zarate bout, among many other famous fights.</p>\\n<p>After these three wins, Hope went up in weight to fight for the vacant British Middleweight title, vacated by Kevin Finnegan, who, in turn, lost four times to Alan Minter. On 10 June, Hope was defeated by knockout for the first time, losing to Bunny Sterling in the eighth round for that regional title.</p>\\n<p>Hope's career took on an upwards movement after the loss to Sterling. He followed that loss with a knockout in a rematch against Larry Paul on 30 September at London's Empire Pool. This was the beginning of a four knockout win streak that took him to fight Tony Poole, 12 April 1976, for the vacant British Commonwealth Jr. Middleweight title. He won the regional belt by knocking out Poole in the twelfth round, and, after one more win, he met future world Middleweight champion Vito Antuofermo, on 10 October, at Rome, Italy, for the European Boxing Union's Jr. Middleweight title. Hope conquered his third regional title by knocking out Antuofermo (who would later last the full fifteen rounds in a fight with Marvin Hagler), in the fifteenth and last round. This bout was Hope's first fight abroad.</p>\\n<p>Having won three regional titles, Hope was ranked among the top Jr. Middleweight challengers by the WBC, and so, he obtained his first world title try, on 15 March 1977, against the WBC's world champion, Eckhard Dagge, in Berlin, Germany. After fifteen rounds, the fight was declared a draw (tie).</p>\\n<p>Hope regrouped with six wins in a row, before getting his second world title try. On 4 March 1979, he faced the then WBC world champion Rocky Mattioli in Sanremo, Italy. Hope became a world champion by knocking Mattioli out in the ninth round.</p>\\n<p>On 25 September, he defended the WBC's world title for the first time, knocking out Mike Baker in the seventh round, at London. His second defence, on 12 June 1980, was a rematch with Mattioli. This time, they fought in London, and Hope repeated his previous win, but with an eleventh round technical knockout instead. On 26 November, he defended his crown against well known Venezuelan contender Carlos Herrera in London, winning by a fifteen round decision.</p>\\n<p>Hope went to Las Vegas, for his next defence, which also turned out to be his first, and, ultimately, last fight in the United States. He planned to marry his girlfriend while in Las Vegas. On 23 May 1981, at the Caesars Palace, Hope lost the world Jr. Middleweight title to Wilfred Benitez, suffering a twelfth round knockout that later made television sports show highlights. While Benitez became the first Latin American to win world titles in three different divisions, the youngest boxer in history to do so, and the first in 40 years to achieve the accomplishment, Hope had to be hospitalised, but he recuperated and was able to marry his girlfriend before returning to England.</p>\\n<p>After one more defeat, to Luigi Minchillo, Hope permanently retired from boxing. Throughout his career Hope was managed by his mentor Terry Lawless, whose stable of top-quality boxers also included John H Stracey, Jim Watt, Charlie Magri and Frank Bruno. Their PR was handled by Norman Giller who, like all the boxers apart from Scottish hero Watt, was based in East London. They all trained in the famous East End fight academy run by Lawless at the Royal Oak in Canning Town. Most of their major fights were under the umbrella of leading London promotion team of Harry Levene, Mike Barrett and Mickey Duff.</p>\\n<p>Hope continued in the public eye in England, doing various jobs, and he has enjoyed his earnings as a boxer. Furthermore with Benitez suffering from diabetes and boxing-related conditions, he has become a frequent visitor to Puerto Rico, where he and Benitez sometimes spend days talking about their old days as boxers. Hope now lives in Antigua after being given land by the government to mark his achievements in the ring. Hope has been an outstanding ambassador for Antigua and is happily involved in the island's tourist industry.</p>\\n<p>Maurice Hope had a record of 30 wins, 4 losses and 1 draw in 35 bouts, with 24 wins by knockout.</p>\\n<p>In recognition of Maurice Hope's achievements while a resident, the London Borough of Hackney named a major cycle route after him.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q1756437\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":414686,\"title\":\"Tom Brake\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Thomas Anthony Brake</b>, known as <b>Tom Brake</b>, (born 6 May 1962) British Liberal Democrat politician.

From the East End of London, Sugar had an estimated fortune of \\u00a3700m (US$1.14 billion) in 2011, and was ranked 89th in the Sunday Times Rich List 2011. In 2007, he sold his remaining interest in the consumer electronics company Amstrad, his largest and best-known business venture.</p>\\n<p>Sugar was chairman of Tottenham Hotspur from 1991 to 2001. Sugar appears in the BBC TV series <i>The Apprentice</i>, which has been broadcast annually since 2005 and is based upon the popular US television show of the same name, featuring the American entrepreneur Donald Trump.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Sugar was born in Hackney, east London, into a Jewish family. He is the youngest of four children of Fay (1907\\u20131994) and Nathan Sugar (1907\\u20131987). His father was a tailor in the garment industry of the East End.</p>\\n<p>When Sugar was young, his family lived in a council flat. Because of his profuse, curly hair, he was nicknamed \\\"Mop head\\\", a name that he still goes by in the present day. He attended Northwold Primary School and then Brooke House Secondary School in Upper Clapton, Hackney, and made extra money by working at a greengrocers. After leaving school at 16, he worked briefly for the civil service as a statistician at the Ministry of Education. He started selling car aerials and electrical goods out of a van which he had bought with his savings of \\u00a350.</p>\\n<h2>Personal life</h2>\\n<p>Sugar and his wife Ann (n\\u00e9e Simons) married on 28 April 1968; they have two sons and a daughter. Sugar and his wife live in Chigwell, Essex. They celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary on 11 May 2008 with a party at their home, where Sir Bruce Forsyth was the compere, Jackie Mason the comic and Sir Elton John played a set. His niece through marriage is actress Rita Simons, best known for playing Roxy Mitchell on the popular UK soap opera <i>EastEnders</i>.</p>\\n<p>A collector of classic Rolls Royce and Bentley motor cars, Sugar owns a Rolls Royce Ghost with the number plate AMS1, which appears during all episodes of <i>The Apprentice.</i> A qualified pilot with 30 years' experience, Sugar owns a Cirrus SR22 four-seat aircraft, based at Stapleford Airfield. During an attempted landing at City Airport Manchester on 5 July 2008, Sugar suffered a crash in this aircraft because of wet and soft field conditions. No injuries were sustained, although Sugar was said to be \\\"very shaken\\\". He is a fan of and the former owner of Tottenham Hotspur.</p>\\n<p>In February 2009, it was reported that Sugar had initiated legal proceedings against <i>The Sun</i> newspaper following a report that he had been named on a \\\"hit list\\\" of British Jews in response to Israel's ongoing military operation in Gaza. The threats are alleged to have been made by Glen Jenvey, the source of the original story in <i>The Sun</i>, who posted to a Muslim website under a false identity.</p>\\n<p>Sugar now has an estimated fortune of \\u00a3900m (US$1.54 billion).</p>\\n<h2>Political involvement</h2>\\n<p>In February 2009, the <i>Evening Standard</i> journalist Andrew Gilligan claimed that Sugar had been approached to be the Labour candidate for Mayor of London in 2012. Sugar subsequently ridiculed the claim in an interview with <i>The Guardian</i>. But, during Prime Minister Gordon Brown's cabinet reshuffle on 5 June 2009, the BBC reported that Sugar would become Lord Sugar and had been offered a job as the government's \\\"Enterprise Champion\\\". On 7 June 2009 Sugar sought to clarify the non-political nature of his appointment. He stated that he would not be joining the government, that the appointment was politically neutral, and that all he wanted to do was help businesses and entrepreneurs. In August 2014, Sugar was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to <i>The Guardian</i> opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.</p>\\n<h2>Ventures</h2>\\n<h3>Amstrad</h3>\\n\\n<p>Sugar founded Amstrad in 1968, the name being an acronym of his initials \\u2013 <i><b>A</b>lan <b>M</b>ichael <b>S</b>ugar <b>Trad</b>ing</i>. The company began as a general importer/exporter and wholesaler, but soon specialised in consumer electronics. By 1970, the first manufacturing venture was underway. He achieved lower production prices by using injection moulding plastics for hi-fi turntable covers, severely undercutting competitors who used vacuum-forming processes. Manufacturing capacity was soon expanded to include the production of audio amplifiers and tuners.</p>\\n\\n<p>In 1980, Amstrad was listed on the London Stock Exchange and during the 1980s Amstrad doubled its profit and market value every year. By 1984, recognising the opportunity of the home computer era, Amstrad launched an 8-bit machine, the Amstrad CPC 464. Although the CPC range were attractive machines, with CP/M-capability and a good BASIC interpreter, it had to compete with its arch-rivals, the more graphically complex Commodore 64 and the popular Sinclair ZX Spectrum, not to mention the highly sophisticated BBC Micro. Despite this, three million units were sold worldwide with a long production life of eight years. It inspired an East German version with Russian Z80 clone processors. In 1985, Sugar had another major breakthrough with the launch of the Amstrad PCW 8256 word processor which, although made of cheap components, retailed at over \\u00a3300. In 1986 Amstrad bought the rights to the Sinclair computer product line and produced two more ZX Spectrum models in a similar style to their CPC machines. It also developed the PC1512, a PC compatible computer, which became quite popular in Europe and was the first in a line of Amstrad PCs.</p>\\n<p>At its peak, Amstrad achieved a stock market value of \\u00a31.2 billion, but the 1990s proved a difficult time for the company. The launch of a range of business PCs was marred by unreliable hard disks (supplied by Seagate), which occasioned a high level of customer dissatisfaction and damage to Amstrad's reputation in the personal computer market, from which it never recovered. Subsequently, Amstrad sued Seagate for $100 million in lost revenue. In the early 1990s, Amstrad began to focus on portable computers rather than desktop computers. Also, in 1990, Amstrad entered the gaming market with the Amstrad GX4000, but it was a commercial failure, largely because there was only a poor selection of games available on it. Additionally, it was immediately superseded by the Japanese consoles: Mega Drive and Super Nintendo, which both had a much more comprehensive selection of games. In 1993, Amstrad released the PenPad, a PDA, and bought into Betacom and Viglen, so as to focus more on telecommunications rather than computers. Amstrad released the first of its combined telephony and e-mail devices, called the <i>e-m@iler</i>, followed by the <i>e-m@ilerplus</i> in 2002, neither of which sold in great volume.</p>\\n<p>On 31 July 2007 it was announced that broadcaster BSkyB had agreed to buy Amstrad for about \\u00a3125m. At the time of the takeover, Sugar commented that he wished to play a part in the business, saying: \\\"I turn 60 this year and I have had 40 years of hustling in the business, but now I have to start thinking about my team of loyal staff, many of whom have been with me for many years.\\\" On 2 July 2008 it was announced that Sugar was standing down from Amstrad as chairman, to focus solely on his other business interests.</p>\\n<h3>Tottenham Hotspur</h3>\\n\\n<p>After a take-over battle with Robert Maxwell, Sugar teamed up with Terry Venables and bought Tottenham Hotspur football club in June 1991. Although Sugar's initial investment helped ease the financial troubles the club was suffering at the time, his treatment of Tottenham as a business venture and not a footballing one made him an unpopular figure among the Spurs fans. In Sugar's nine years as chairman, Tottenham Hotspur did not finish in the top six in the league and won just one trophy, the 1999 Football League Cup.</p>\\n<p>Sugar sacked Venables the night before the 1993 FA Cup Final, a decision which led to Venables appealing to the high courts for reinstatement. A legal battle for the club took place over the summer, which Sugar won (see <i>Re Tottenham Hotspur plc</i> [1994] 1 BCLC 655). The decision to sack Venables angered many of Tottenham fans, and Sugar later said, \\\"I felt as though I'd killed Bambi.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In 1992 he was the only representative of the then big five (Arsenal, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham) who voted in favour of Sky's bid for Premier League television rights. The other four voted in favour of ITV's bid, as it had promised to show big fives games more often. At the time of the vote, Sugar's company Amstrad was developing satellite dishes for Sky.</p>\\n<p>In 1994 Sugar financed the transfers of three stars of the 1994 World Cup: Ilie Dumitrescu, Gica Popescu, and most notably J\\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, who had an excellent first season in English football, being named Footballer of the Year. Because Spurs had not qualified for the UEFA Cup, Klinsmann decided to invoke an opt-out clause in his contract and left for Bayern Munich in the summer of 1995. Sugar appeared on television holding the last shirt Klinsmann wore for Spurs and said he wouldn't wash his car with it. He called foreigners coming into the Premier League at high wages as \\\"Carlos Kickaballs\\\". Klinsmann retaliated by calling Sugar \\\"a man without honour\\\", and said:</p>\\n<p>\\\"He only ever talks about money. He never talks about the game. I would say there is a big question mark over whether Sugar's heart is in the club and in football. The big question is what he likes more, the business or the football?\\\" Klinsmann re-signed for Tottenham on loan in December 1997.</p>\\n<p>In October 1998, former Tottenham striker Teddy Sheringham released his autobiography, in which he attacked Sugar as the reason he left Tottenham in 1997. Sheringham said Sugar had accused him of feigning injury during a long spell on the sidelines during the 1993/1994 season. He wrote that Sugar had refused to give him the five-year contract he wanted, as he had not believed Sheringham would still get into the Tottenham team when he was 36. Sheringham returned to Tottenham after his spell at Manchester United and continued to start for the first team until he was released in the summer of 2003, at age 37. Sheringham said that Sugar lacked ambition and was hypocritical. As an example, Sugar asked him for recommendations of players; when Sheringham suggested England midfielder Paul Ince, Sugar refused because he did not want to spend \\u00a34 million on a player who would soon be 30. After Sheringham left Spurs, Sugar approved the signing of Les Ferdinand, aged 31, for a club record \\u00a36 million, on higher wages than Sheringham had wanted.</p>\\n<p>Sugar appointed seven managers in his time at Spurs. The first was Peter Shreeves, followed by the dual management team of Doug Livermore and Ray Clemence, former Spurs midfielder Osvaldo Ardiles, and up and coming young manager Gerry Francis. In 1997 Sugar stunned the footballing world by appointing the relatively unknown Swiss manager Christian Gross. Gross lasted 9 months as Spurs finished in 14th place in 1998, and began the next season with just 3 points from their opening three games. Sugar next appointed George Graham, a former player and manager of bitter rivals Arsenal. Despite his earning Tottenham's first trophy in 8 years, the Spurs fans never warmed to Graham, partly because of his Arsenal connections. They disliked the negative, defensive style of football which he had Spurs playing; fans claimed it was not the \\\"Tottenham way\\\".</p>\\n<p>In February 2001, Sugar sold his majority stake at Tottenham to leisure group ENIC, selling 27% of the club for \\u00a322 million. In June 2007, Sugar sold his remaining shares to ENIC for \\u00a325 million, ending his 16-year association with the club. He has described his time at Tottenham as \\\"a waste of my life\\\". Sugar later donated \\u00a33 million from the proceeds of the sale of his interests in Tottenham Hotspur to the refurbishment of the Hackney Empire in his native East End of London.</p>\\n<h3>Amsair</h3>\\n<p>Amsair Executive Aviation was founded in 1993, and is run by Sugar's son Daniel Patrick. As with Amstrad, the name Amsair is an acronym taken from the initials of Sugar's name \\\"<b>A</b>lan <b>M</b>ichael <b>S</b>ugar <b>Air</b>.\\\" Amsair operates a large Cessna fleet, and one Embraer Legacy 650 with the registration G-SUGA, offering business and executive jet charters.</p>\\n<h3>Amsprop</h3>\\n\\n<p>Amsprop is an investment firm owned by Sugar and is now controlled by his son Daniel Patrick.</p>\\n<p>Simon Ambrose, winner of the 2007 series of The Apprentice, started working for Amsprop Estates after the series finished. However, in April 2010, he was reported to be leaving to start his own venture.</p>\\n<h3>Viglen Ltd</h3>\\n\\n<p>Sugar was the owner (and Chairman of the board) of Viglen Ltd, an IT services provider catering primarily to the education and public sector. He resigned his position on 1 July 2009. Following the sale of Amstrad PLC to BSkyB, Viglen is now Sugar's sole IT establishment.</p>\\n<h3>Amscreen</h3>\\n<p>Sugar is Chairman of Amscreen, a company run by his eldest son Simon Sugar, specialising in selling advertising space on digital signage screens that it provides to retailers, medical centres and leisure venues.</p>\\n<p><i>Apprentice</i> winner Yasmina Siadatan works there, selling into the NHS.</p>\\n<p>The screens use a Face detection system called OptimEyes to try to identify age and sex of its viewers</p>\\n<h3>YouView</h3>\\n<p>On 7 March 2011, Sugar replaced Kip Meek on the board of the BBC initiated IPTV project known as YouView (formerly known as Project Canvas) which is also backed by ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 and broadband providers including BT and TalkTalk. Sugar was paid \\u00a3500,000 for chairing YouView for the year ending March 2012.</p>\\n<h2>Television appearances</h2>\\n<h3><i>The Apprentice</i></h3>\\n\\n<p>Sugar became the star of the BBC reality show <i>The Apprentice</i> which has had one series broadcast each year from 2005, in the same role as Donald Trump in the US version. Sugar fires a candidate each week until one candidate is left, who is then employed in his company or (since the 2011 series) wins a partnership with Sugar, including his investment of \\u00a3250,000 to establish their own business.</p>\\n<p>As a condition for appearing in the third series, Sugar placed a requirement that the show be more business-orientated rather than just entertainment and that he should be portrayed in a less harsh light, to counter his somewhat belligerent reputation. He also expressed a desire that the calibre of the candidates should be higher than those who had appeared in the second series (who had come across as manifestly lacklustre) and that the motives of the candidates for participating are scrutinised more carefully, given that certain of the candidates in previous series had used their successful experience in the show as a springboard to advance their own careers (as occurred with Michelle Dewberry, the winner of the second series, who left Amstrad's employment only 8 months after taking up the job).</p>\\n<p>Sugar has criticised the US version of <i>The Apprentice</i> because \\\"they've made the fatal error of trying to change things just for the sake of it and it backfired.\\\"</p>\\n<h3><i>Young Apprentice</i></h3>\\n\\n<p>Young Apprentice (Junior Apprentice in series 1) is a British reality television programme in which a group of twelve young people, aged 16 and 17, compete to win a \\u00a325,000 prize from the Lord Sugar. The six-part series began on BBC One and BBC HD on Wednesday, 12 May 2010, concluding on Thursday, 10 June of the same year, and also featured Nick Hewer and Karren Brady as Sugar's advisors. Karren Brady made her debut on Junior Apprentice, because it aired before she appeared on the adult version. The programme concluded with Sugar awarding the prize fund to 17-year-old Arjun Rajyagor and Tim Ankers finished in second place.</p>\\n<p>The second series started in October 2011, and this time featured eight episodes and twelve contestants. The series was won by Zara Brownless, with James McCullough as runner-up.</p>\\n<p>Originally proposed in March 2008 and confirmed in June 2009, Junior Apprentice received mostly positive reviews from critics. The programme is a spin-off from the series The Apprentice, which was in turn spawned from an American series of the same name, which stars the entrepreneur Donald Trump. Sugar's role under Gordon Brown's government sparked a debate over the BBC's political impartiality regulations in the run-up to the UK 2010 election, resulting in both Junior Apprentice and the sixth regular edition of The Apprentice being delayed.</p>\\n<h3>Other appearances</h3>\\n<p>In May 2008, Sugar made an appearance on <i>An Audience Without Jeremy Beadle</i> to pay tribute to Jeremy Beadle as they were close friends and both appeared on a celebrity special of <i>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?</i> in 2005.</p>\\n<p>In January 2009, Fiona Bruce presented a BBC Two documentary entitled <i>The Real Sir Alan</i>. Also in 2009, Sugar appeared in television advertisements for investment bank NS&amp;I and The Learning and Skills Council talking about apprenticeships.</p>\\n<p>In May 2011, Sugar presented <i>Lord Sugar Tackles Football</i>, a documentary looking into the financial woes of English football.</p>\\n<p>In September 2012, Sugar appeared as himself in a cameo in the Doctor Who episode \\\"The Power of Three\\\".  Sugar's cameo was filmed on the set of <i>The Apprentice</i>.</p>\\n<p>In November 2012, Sugar appeared as himself in a cameo in a special episode of <i>EastEnders</i> for <i>Children in Need</i>.</p>\\n<h2>Honours and philanthropy</h2>\\n<p>Sugar was knighted as a Knight Bachelor in the 2000 New Year Honours \\\"for services to the Home Computer and Electronics Industry\\\". He holds two honorary Doctorates of Science, awarded in 1988 by City University and in 2005 by Brunel University. He is a philanthropist for charities such as Jewish Care and Great Ormond Street Hospital, and donated \\u00a3200,000 to the British Labour Party in 2001.

Much of his work is rooted in London, most recently within the influences of psychogeography.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Life and work</h2>\\n<p>Sinclair was born in Cardiff, and educated at Trinity College, Dublin (where he edited <i>Icarus</i>). He attended the Courtauld Institute of Art (University of London), and the London School of Film Technique (now the London Film School).</p>\\n<h3>Development as author</h3>\\n<p>His early work was mostly poetry, much of it published by his own small press, Albion Village Press. He was (and remains) closely connected with the British avant garde poetry scene of the 1960s and 1970s \\u2013 authors such as Edward Dorn, J. H. Prynne, Douglas Oliver, Peter Ackroyd and Brian Catling are often quoted in his work and even turn up in fictionalized form as characters; later on, taking over from John Muckle, Sinclair edited the Paladin Poetry Series and, in 1996, the Picador anthology <i>Conductors of Chaos</i>.</p>\\n<p>His early books <i>Lud Heat</i> (1975) and <i>Suicide Bridge</i> (1979) were a mixture of essay, fiction and poetry; they were followed by <i>White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings</i> (1987), a novel juxtaposing the tale of a disreputable band of bookdealers on the hunt for a priceless copy of Arthur Conan Doyle's <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> and the Jack the Ripper murders (here attributed to the physician William Gull).</p>\\n<p>Sinclair was for some time perhaps best known for the novel <i>Downriver</i> (1991), which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the 1992 Encore Award. It envisages the UK under the rule of the Widow, a grotesque version of Margaret Thatcher as viewed by her harshest critics, who supposedly establishes a one party state in a fifth term. <i>Radon's Daughter</i> formed the third part of a trilogy with <i>White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings</i> and <i>Downriver.</i></p>\\n<p>The volume of essays <i>Lights Out for the Territory</i> gained Sinclair a wider readership by treating the material of his novels in non-fiction form. His essay 'Sorry Meniscus' (1999) ridicules the Millennium Dome. In 1997, he collaborated with Chris Petit, sculptor Steve Dilworth, and others to make <i>The Falconer</i>, a 56-minute semi-fictional 'documentary' film set in London and the Outer Hebrides about the British underground filmmaker Peter Whitehead. It also features Stewart Home, Kathy Acker and Howard Marks.</p>\\n<h3>Psychogeography</h3>\\n<p>Much of Sinclair's recent work consists of an ambitious and elaborate literary recuperation of the so-called occultist psychogeography of London. Other psychogeographers who have worked on similar material include Will Self, Stewart Home and the London Psychogeographical Association.</p>\\n<p>One of a series of works focused around London is the non-fiction <i>London Orbital</i>; the hard cover edition was published in 2002, along with a documentary film of the same name and subject. It describes a series of trips he took tracing the M25, London's outer-ring motorway, on foot. Sinclair followed this with <i>Edge of the Orison</i> in 2005, a psychogeographical reconstruction of the poet John Clare's walk from Dr Matthew Allen's private lunatic asylum, at Fairmead House, High Beach, in the centre of Epping Forest in Essex, to his home in Helpston, near Peterborough. Sinclair also writes about Claybury Asylum, another psychiatric hospital in Essex, in <i>Rodinsky's Room</i>, a collaboration with the artist Rachel Lichtenstein.</p>\\n<p>In 2008 he wrote the introduction to <i>Wide Boys Never Work</i>, the London Books reissue of Robert Westerby's classic London low-life novel. <i>Hackney, That Rose-Red Empire: A Confidential Report</i> followed in 2009.</p>\\n<p>Sinclair's book <i>Ghost Milk</i> criticizes the British government for using the 2012 Summer Olympics as an excuse to militarize London while forcing the poorest citizens out of their homes.</p>\\n<p>In an interview with <i>This Week in Science</i>, William Gibson said that Sinclair was his favourite author. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2009. Sinclair commented: \\\"I have always admired the RSPCA. They do a lot of good work.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Iain Sinclair lives in Haggerston, in the London Borough of Hackney, and has a flat in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Iain_Sinclair_cheltenham.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q5980623\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":3302378,\"title\":\"Kevin Lisbie\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Kevin Anthony Lisbie</b> (born 17 October 1978) is a footballer who plays for Leyton Orient as a striker.

He was the President of the Labour Party from 2003 until 2011, when he resigned following his election as President of Ireland.</p>\\n<p>He made the first state visit of an Irish president to the United Kingdom in April 2014.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Higgins was born in Limerick on the 18 April 1941. His father John Higgins was from Ballycar, County Clare and was a Lieutenant with the Charleville Company, 3rd Battalion, 2nd Cork Brigade of the Irish Republican Army. John Higgins, along with his two brothers - Peter and Michael, had been active participants in the Irish War of Independence.</p>\\n<p>When his father's health grew poor, with alcohol a contributing factor, his mother sent Higgins, aged five, and his four-year-old brother to live on his unmarried uncle and aunt's farm near Newmarket on Fergus, County Clare. His older twin sisters remained in Limerick. He was educated at Ballycar National School, County Clare; St. Flannan's College, Ennis; University College Galway (UCG); Indiana University; and Manchester University.</p>\\n<p>As an undergraduate at UCG, he served as Vice-Auditor of the College's Literary and Debating Society in 1963\\u201364, and rose to the position of Auditor in the 1964\\u201365 academic year. He also served as President of UCG Students' Union in 1964\\u201365. In 1967, Higgins graduated from Indiana University Bloomington with a Master of Arts degree in Sociology.</p>\\n<p>In his academic career, he was a Statutory Lecturer in the Department of Political Science and Sociology at University College Galway and was a Visiting Professor at Southern Illinois University. He resigned his academic posts to concentrate fully on his political career.</p>\\n<p>He is a fluent speaker of both official languages, Irish and English, and also speaks Spanish.</p>\\n<h2>Family life</h2>\\n<p>His wife, Sabina Coyne, is an actress and a native of Cloonrane, a townland in County Galway near Ballindine, County Mayo. She grew up on a farm there in a family of five girls and two boys. She developed an interest in theatre and trained using Stanislavski's system.</p>\\n<p>Higgins met Coyne in 1969 at a party in the family home of journalist Mary Kenny. Higgins proposed over Christmas 1973 and they were married the year after. They have four children: Alice Mary, twins John and Michael Jr., and Daniel. He has two Bernese mountain dogs named Bruno and Shadow.</p>\\n<h2>Political career</h2>\\n<h3>Seanad and D\\u00e1il \\u00c9ireann</h3>\\n<p>Higgins originally joined Fianna F\\u00e1il in UCG while a mature student; he switched to the Labour Party shortly thereafter. He was a Labour candidate in the 1969 and 1973 general elections but was unsuccessful on both occasions. One of the people who canvassed for him was future leader of the Labour Party and T\\u00e1naiste, Eamon Gilmore, who was then a UCG student. Higgins was appointed in 1973 to the 13th Seanad \\u00c9ireann by Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave. He was first elected to D\\u00e1il \\u00c9ireann at the 1981 general election as a Labour Party TD. He was re-elected at the February 1982 election; he lost his seat at the November 1982 election but returned to the Seanad on the NUI panel. He served as Mayor of Galway on two occasions, 1982\\u20131983 and 1991\\u20131992. Within the Labour Party during the 1980s he was one of the main figures along with Emmet Stagg who opposed going into coalition.</p>\\n<p>Higgins returned to the D\\u00e1il at the 1987 general election and held his seat until the 2011 general election. In 1993 he joined the Cabinet as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. During his period as Minister he scrapped the controversial Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, re-established the Irish Film Board and set up the Irish language television station, Teilif\\u00eds na Gaeilge (subsequently renamed TG4). In 2000, he was appointed to the Labour Party front bench. In 2003, Higgins succeeded to Proinsias De Rossa's symbolic position of the President of the Labour Party, while continuing as the party's spokesman on foreign affairs.</p>\\n<p>With a presidential election looming in 2004 Higgins indicated his willingness to run as a Labour Party candidate. The party decided on 16 September 2004 against running a candidate in the election.</p>\\n<p>In October 2010, he announced he would not be standing at the 2011 general election. He had until this point been living in a modest two-bed apartment at Grattan Hall on Mount Street, Dublin. He also has a family home in Galway.</p>\\n<h3>2011 presidential campaign</h3>\\n\\n<p>In September 2010 Higgins indicated that he was interested in receiving the Labour Party's nomination for the 2011 presidential election. He said prior to the election campaign, and repeated during it, that he would serve only one seven year term as President, and would not seek a second term of office, despite being entitled to do so.</p>\\n<p>He was selected as candidate for the presidency at a special convention in Dublin on 19 June 2011, beating former senator Kathleen O'Meara and former party adviser Fergus Finlay. His candidacy was endorsed by Hollywood actor Martin Sheen, who described Higgins as a \\\"dear friend\\\". Higgins assisted his rival David Norris by urging his party colleagues on Dublin City Council not to obstruct Norris's attempts to get onto the ballot at the last moment \\\"in the interests of democracy\\\", adding that the nomination criteria were \\\"outdated\\\".</p>\\n<p>Higgins was confronted by former Tara mines workers while canvassing in Meath. . . The workers were upset about their pensions being cut. Higgins was also pursued by his past links to the Fianna F\\u00e1il party, and admitted on 13 October that he had been elected chairman of the UCG Fianna F\\u00e1il university cumann in 1966. While at university in the United States he had, he admitted, smoked marijuana. However, media reports said he was \\\"spared the intense grilling Miriam O'Callaghan meted out to some of the others\\\" during the <i>Prime Time</i> debate. Higgins promised he would be a neutral president if elected and not be a \\\"handmaiden\\\" to the government. The Labour Party's budget for the campaign was within \\u20ac320,000.</p>\\n<p>On 29 October 2011, two days after the presidential election was held, Higgins was declared the winner with a total of 1,007,104 votes, far more than any Irish politician in the history of the republic. Thousands of people lined the streets of Galway to welcome him home the following day. International media coverage of his win reported his humble background, poetry, intellect and short stature (he stands 163\\u00a0cm (5\\u00a0ft 4\\u00a0in)), with <i>The Washington Post</i> noting \\\"local satirists sometimes depict him as an elf, hobbit or leprechaun talking in riddles and verse\\\". He is the first President of Ireland to have served in both Houses of the Oireachtas having previously been a member of D\\u00e1il \\u00c9ireann (Lower House) and Seanad \\u00c9ireann (Upper house).</p>\\n<p>Before his inauguration he and his family met his predecessor Mary McAleese and her husband Martin for lunch at \\u00c1ras an Uachtar\\u00e1in on 3 November. That night, he presented an award to Niall T\\u00f3ib\\u00edn, and received his own standing ovation as he entered the Irish Film Institute. On 5 November, he attended an important football game, featuring his beloved Galway United versus Monaghan United in the second leg in the League of Ireland promotion/relegation play-off at Terryland Park, wrapped in the scarf of his favourite team, and being greeted by a large banner hanging from a stand declaring \\\"Welcome home to Galway, Mr President\\\".</p>\\n<h2>Presidency</h2>\\n<p>Higgins was inaugurated as President of Ireland at Dublin Castle on 11 November 2011 giving a speech as part of the ceremony. The ceremony had a humanist element, alongside Christian, Jewish and Muslim ones.</p>\\n<p>Higgins receives an annual salary of \\u20ac250,000. After assuming office, the President wrote to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to request that his salary be reduced by 23.5 percent from \\u20ac325,000 to about \\u20ac250,000.</p>\\n<p>Higgins travelled to Derry to attend the final of the all-island school choir of the year competition on 13 November 2011, for his first official presidential engagement in Northern Ireland.</p>\\n<p>In December 2011, Higgins hosted a children's tea party at \\u00c1ras an Uachtar\\u00e1in, during which the children became acquainted with Santa Claus. He attended the Bon Secours Hospital in Galway on 13 December for surgery on the kneecap that was broken in a fall during a visit to Buenaventura, Colombia in 2010.</p>\\n<p>Higgins made his first official trip abroad when he went to London on 21 February 2012. While there he was given a tour of the Olympic Stadium by Sebastian Coe and attended a production of <i>Juno and the Paycock</i> at the Lyttelton Theatre. He made his first official visit to his <i>alma mater</i> NUI Galway on 24 February where he opened an autism centre. On 21 March 2012, President Higgins was announced as sole patron of the RT\\u00c9 National Symphony Orchestra. Addressing a conference organised by youth organisation For\\u00f3ige on 24 March 2012, President Higgins described homophobia and racism in Ireland as a \\\"blight on society\\\".</p>\\n<p>In January 2012, President Higgins agreed to become the Patron of Clans of Ireland, including its Order of Merit. On the President's behalf, Leo Varadkar, Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, awarded \\\"Companionship\\\" in this Order of Clans of Ireland to several nominees at a ceremony in the Mansion House, Dublin on 28 April 2012.</p>\\n\\n<p>On 11 May 2012, he became the 28th Freeman of Galway six months to the day since his inauguration.</p>\\n<p>In June 2012, nonprofit housing organisation Habitat for Humanity Ireland announced that President Higgins would be their sole Patron. In October 2012, President Higgins and his wife Sabina went to South America for a two-week trip to take in Argentina, Brazil and Chile.</p>\\n<p>President Higgins rushed home from his visit to Rome to sign the <i>Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Bill 2013</i> into law at \\u00c1ras an Uachtar\\u00e1in early on 7 February 2013.</p>\\n<p>On 29 July 2013, he convened a meeting of the Council of State, the first of his presidency, to consult on the <i>Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013</i>.</p>\\n<p>Special advisor to the president, Mary van Lieshout, who formed part of the management team in \\u00c1ras an Uachtar\\u00e1in under secretary general Adrian O\\u2019Neill, resigned in November 2013. The departure raised criticism over presidential management of the team.</p>\\n<p>The presidential Christmas messages delivered by Higgins from 2011 to 2013 did not mention Christianity or religion, which was criticised by the Defence Forces' chaplain in a homily on Christmas Eve 2013. The Chief of Staff expressed regret for any offence caused by the chaplain.</p>\\n<p>In April 2014, Higgins paid the first state visit to the United Kingdom by an Irish president. He stayed as a guest of the Queen at Windsor Castle and addressed both Houses of Parliament. He also met with various people, including the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, opposition party leaders at Westminster, and the Lord Mayor of London. It was Higgins' 14th visit to the United Kingdom since he became president.</p>\\n<h2>Council of State</h2>\\n\\n<h3>Presidential appointees</h3>\\n<p>Higgins appointed his Council of State nominees on 6 January 2012.

The area of Hoxton is bordered by Regent's Canal on the north side, Wharf Road and City Road to the west, Old Street to the south, and Kingsland Road to the east.</p>\\n<p>Hoxton is also a ward, electing three councillors to Hackney London Borough Council. It forms part of the Hackney South and Shoreditch constituency.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Historical Hoxton</h2>\\n<h3>Origins</h3>\\n<p>\\\"Hogesdon\\\" is first recorded in the Domesday Book, meaning an Anglo-Saxon farm (or \\\"fortified enclosure\\\") belonging to <i>Hoch</i>, or <i>Hocq</i>. Little is recorded of the origins of the settlement, though there was Roman activity around Ermine Street, which ran to the east of the area from the 1st century. In medieval times, Hoxton formed a rural part of Shoreditch parish. It achieved independent ecclesiastical status in 1826 with the founding of its own parish church dedicated to St John the Baptist, though civil jurisdiction was still invested in the Shoreditch vestry. The Worshipful Company of Haberdashers remains Patron of the advowson of the parish of St John's.</p>\\n<p>In 1415, the Lord Mayor of London \\\"caused the wall of the City to be broken towards Moorfields, and built the postern called Moorgate, for the ease of the citizens to walk that way upon causeways towards Islington and Hoxton\\\" \\u2013 at that time, still marshy areas. The residents responded by harassing walkers to protect their fields. A century later, the hedges and ditches were destroyed, by order of the City, to enable City dwellers to partake in leisure at Hoxton.</p>\\n<h3>Tudor Hoxton</h3>\\n<p>By Tudor times many moated manor houses existed to provide ambassadors and courtiers country air nearby the City. This included many Catholics, attracted by the house of the Portuguese Ambassador, who, in his private chapel, celebrated the masses forbidden in a Protestant country. One such resident was Sir Thomas Tresham, who was imprisoned here by Elizabeth I of England for harbouring Catholic priests. The open fields to the north and west were frequently used for archery practice, and on 22 September 1598 the playwright Ben Jonson fought a fatal duel in Hoxton Fields, killing actor Gabriel Spencer. Jonson was able to prove his literacy, thereby claiming benefit of clergy to escape a hanging.</p>\\n<p>Hoxton's public gardens were a popular resort from the overcrowded City streets, and it is reputed that the name of Pimlico came from the publican, Ben Pimlico, and his particular brew.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><i>Have at thee, then, my merrie boyes, and beg for old Ben Pimlico\\u2019s nut-brown ale</i>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The gardens appear to have been situated near Hoxton Street, known at that time, as <i>Pimlico Path</i>. The modern area of Pimlico derives its name from its former use in Hoxton.</p>\\n<h3>Gunpowder, treason and a letter</h3>\\n\\n<p>On 26 October 1605 Hoxton achieved notoriety, when a letter arrived at the home of local resident William Parker, Lord Monteagle warning him not to attend the Parliament summoned by James I to convene on 5 November, because \\\"yet I say they shall receive a terrible blow, the Parliament, and yet they shall not see who hurts them\\\". The letter may have been sent by his brother-in-law Francis Tresham, or he may have written it himself, to curry favour. The letter was read aloud at supper, before prominent Catholics, and then he delivered it personally to Robert Cecil at Whitehall. While the conspirators were alerted, by the public reading, to the existence of the letter they persevered with their plot as their gunpowder remained undiscovered. William Parker accompanied Thomas Howard, the Lord Chamberlain, at his visit to the undercroft of Parliament, where Guy Fawkes was found in the early hours of 5 November. Most of the conspirators fled on the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, but Francis Tresham was arrested a few days later at his house in Hoxton. A commemorative plaque is attached to modern flats at the site of Parker's house in Hoxton Street.</p>\\n<h3>Almshouses and madhouses</h3>\\n<p>By the end of the 17th century the nobility's estates began to be broken up. Many of these large houses became to be used as schools, hospitals or mad houses, with almshouses being built on the land between by benefactors, most of whom were City liverymen. Aske's Almshouses were built on Pitfield Street in 1689 from Robert Aske's endowment for 20 poor haberdashers and a school for 20 children of freemen. Hoxton House, was established as a private asylum in 1695. It was owned by the Miles family, and expanded rapidly into the surrounding streets being described by Coleridge as <i>the</i> Hoxton madhouse. Here fee-paying 'gentle and middle class' people took their exercise in the extensive grounds between Pitfield Street and Kingsland Road; including the poet Charles Lamb. Over 500 pauper lunatics resided in closed wards, and it remained the Naval Lunatic Asylum until 1818. The asylum closed in 1911; and the only remains are by Hackney Community College, where a part of the house was incorporated into the school that replaced it in 1921. At this time Hoxton Square and Charles Square were laid out, forming a fashionable area. Non-conformist sects were attracted to the area, away from the restrictions of the City's regulations.</p>\\n<h3>Victorian era and 20th century</h3>\\n\\n<p>In the Victorian era the railways made travelling to distant suburbs easier, and this combined with infill building and industrialisation to drive away the wealthier classes, leaving Hoxton a concentration of the poor with many slums. The area became a centre for the furniture trade.</p>\\n<p>Charles Booth in <i>Life and Labour of the People in London</i> of 1902 gave the following description:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The character of the whole locality is working-class. Poverty is everywhere, with a considerable admixture of the very poor and vicious\\u00a0... Large numbers have been and are still being displaced by the encroachment of warehouses and factories\\u00a0... Hoxton is known for its costers and Curtain criminals, for its furniture trade\\u00a0... No servants</p>\\n<p>are kept except in the main Road shopping streets and in a few remaining middle class squares in the west.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>In Hoxton Street, a plaque marks the location of the Britannia Theatre. This evolved from the former Pimlico tea gardens, a tavern and a saloon, into a 3,000-seat theatre, designed by Finch Hill. Together with the nearby Pollock's Toy Museum, it was destroyed in Second World War bombing. Hoxton Hall, also in Hoxton Street, which survives as a community centre, began life in 1863 as a 'saloon style' music hall. It remains largely in its original form, as for many years it was used as a Quaker meeting house. There was also the 1870 Varieties Music Hall (by C. J. Phipps) in nearby Pitfield Street, this became a cinema in 1910, closing in 1941. Since 2003 the site has remained empty, but in 2008 it was gutted and prepared for a refurb. Local opposition to the design has resulted in the project being put on hold, so it now remains empty and \\\"For Sale\\\".</p>\\n<p>In the former vestry of St Leonard Shoreditch Electric Light Station, just to the north of Hoxton Market, is based The Circus Space. Inside, the \\\"Generating Chamber\\\" and \\\"Combustion Chamber\\\" provide facilities for circus training and production. The building was constructed by the Vestry in 1895 to burn local rubbish and generate electricity. It also provided steam to heat the public baths. This replaced an earlier facility providing gas-light, located in Shoreditch.</p>\\n<p>Gainsborough Studios were located in a former power station, in Poole Street, by the Regents Canal. The film studios operated there from 1924 to 1951. An historical plaque is attached to the building, now a modern apartment block, that occupies the site since the studios' demolition in 2002. The plaque reads</p>\\n<dl><dd><i>London Borough of Hackney</i></dd>\\n<dd><i>The Gainsborough Film Studios 1924\\u20131949</i></dd>\\n<dd><i>Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Balcon, Ivor Novello, Gracie Fields, \\\"The Lady Vanishes\\\", \\\"The Wicked Lady\\\" worked and were filmed here</i></dd>\\n</dl><p>With a new-found popularity, large parts of Hoxton have been gentrified; this has inevitably aroused hostility among some local residents, who believe they are being priced out of the area. Some parts of Hoxton, however, remain deprived with council housing dominating the landscape.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Today</h3>\\n<p>The geographical distinction between Hoxton and Shoreditch is often confused. The two districts have a historical link as part of the same manor, and in the 19th century both formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch. This was incorporated into the newly created London Borough of Hackney in 1965, but old street signs bearing the name are still to be found throughout the area.</p>\\n<p>Manufacturing developments in the years after the Second World War meant that many of the small industries that characterised Hoxton moved out. By the early 1980s, these industrial lofts and buildings came to be occupied by young artists as inexpensive live/work spaces, while exhibitions, raves and clubs occupied former office and retail space at the beginning of the 1990s. During this time Joshua Compston established his Factual Nonsense gallery on Charlotte Road in Shoreditch and organised art fetes in Hoxton Square. Their presence gradually drew other creative industries into the area, especially magazines, design firms, and dot-coms.</p>\\n<p>By the end of the 20th century, the southern half of Hoxton had become a vibrant arts and entertainment district boasting a large number of bars, nightclubs, restaurants, and art galleries. In this period, the new Hoxton residents could be identified by their obscurely fashionable (or \\\"ironically\\\" unfashionable) clothes and their hair (the so-called \\\"Hoxton Fin\\\", as exemplified by Fran Healy of Travis). The excesses and fashion-centricity of Hoxton and Shoreditch denizens have been satirised in the satirical magazine <i>Shoreditch Twat</i>, on the TVGoHome website, and in the sitcom <i>Nathan Barley</i>. This fashionable area centres around Hoxton Square, a small park bordered mainly by former industrial buildings, as well as the elegant 19th century parish church of St John's.</p>\\n<p>The northern half of the district is more residential and contains many council housing estates and new-build private residences. Residents are typically older and the unemployment and crime rates, with the exceptions of drug offences, robbery and theft, are relatively high compared to some parts of the borough. Hoxton Street Market is the focal point of this end of the district. The market sells a wide range of household goods during the week and specialises in independent fashion, art and design products on Saturdays. Nearby is the Geffrye Museum and Hoxton War Memorial.</p>\\n<p>Property prices have continued to rise steeply since the early years of the 21st century as property developers have moved to cash in on the area's trendy image, central location and transport links. Some galleries have, as a result, moved to nearby Shoreditch, or have relocated further afield to cheaper districts such as London Fields or Bethnal Green. In response, the local council formed a not-for-profit corporation, Shoreditch Our Way (now called The Shoreditch Trust), to buy local buildings and lease them out as community facilities and housing. The extension of the East London Line (completed in 2010), has provided the local rail access which was lost when the line from Broad Street closed to services.</p>\\n<h3>Hoxton Market</h3>\\n<p>Hoxton Market, which is now in Hoxton Street rather than its original site to the west of Hoxton Square, was founded in 1687. This market was the cornerstone of the local community but, from the 1980s onwards, changed from a thriving market to one that lost its trade to the move towards supermarkets and away from the traditional street market meeting all of the community's needs. In 2013 the local business community, working with the Council, started work to revive the market and this has attracted great attention and increased trade, complemented by new shops opening along the length of the market.</p>\\n<h2>People with Hoxton links</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>Charles Bradlaugh, founder of the National Secular Society in 1866, was born in Hoxton.</li>\\n<li>Frank Chapple, union leader, was born and raised in Hoxton.

In 1818 he was a member of a discussion group that met in St Andrew's Chapel, Edinburgh, and he tried to persuade that group to form a newsroom. When the group refused to take up this idea, he apparently left Scotland in disgust and travelled to London, where he became a part-time publisher and editor of <i>The Sun</i>.</p>\\n<p>On 23 January 1821 he met a group of printers at Mitchell's Assembly Rooms, London, where he outlined a plan to form a community. The idea was taken up, a committee was formed, and the group began to raise money. To help with the fund-raising Mudie began a weekly journal, the <i>Economist</i>, starting 21 January 1821.</p>\\n<p>By 17 November 1821 the 'Spa Fields Congregational Families' had taken a number of properties at Guildford Street East, Bagnigge Wells Road and Spa Fields, and had begun to live together. George Hinde was chairman of the community and one of its most prominent members was Henry Hetherington, a London printer.</p>\\n<p>By March 1822 Mudie's work on the <i>Economist</i> had become slovenly due to his workload with the community, and he ceased publication of the periodical.

He was born to a Greek Cypriot father and British mother.</p>\\n<p>Newman's first speaking appearance was with Third World First (now known as People and Planet), the student political organisation. In addition to comedy and writing, he has also worked as a paperboy in Whitwell, Hertfordshire, farmhand, warehouse-man, house-painter, teacher, mail sorter, social worker, mover, and broadcaster.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Comedy career</h2>\\n<p>Newman read English at Selwyn College, Cambridge. He began his comedy career as an impressionist in the late 1980s before gaining fame when he appeared alongside fellow Cambridge alumni David Baddiel, Hugh Dennis and Steve Punt in the BBC radio and TV programme <i>The Mary Whitehouse Experience</i> (1989\\u201392). The title referred to the main campaigner for \\\"moral decency\\\" on television, Mary Whitehouse. With <i>The Mary Whitehouse Experience</i>, Newman and Baddiel had become \\\"unlikely pin-ups as, in the early 1990s, comedy was being f\\u00eated as 'the new rock and roll',\\\" leading to their own series, <i>Newman and Baddiel in Pieces</i> (1993).</p>\\n<p>The partnership with Baddiel was widely reported as being fraught with tension. Unlike most double acts, their shows (both on TV and stage) were characterised by the two alternately delivering monologues, rarely appearing together except in sketches (most famously, History Today). During the \\\"Live and in Pieces\\\" tour, relations deteriorated further, and the Wembley show was widely and accurately predicted to be their last appearance together.</p>\\n<p>After the break-up, the two men took wildly differing career paths. While Baddiel became part of the \\\"new lad\\\" phenomenon of the mid-1990s, fronting shows like Fantasy Football League, Newman largely disappeared from public life, reappearing with solo work marked by a clear social conscience and anti-establishment views. He covered the anti-globalisation Seattle protests of 1999 for the UK's Channel 4 News. He has been politically active with Reclaim the Streets, the Liverpool Dockers, Indymedia and Peoples' Global Action.</p>\\n<p>His later work is characterised by a very strong political element, and parallels the work of contemporaries such as Mark Thomas. In 2003 Newman toured with <i>From Caliban to the Taliban</i>, which was released on CD and DVD. In 2005 the show <i>Apocalypso Now or, from P45 to AK47, how to Grow the Economy with the Use of War</i> debuted at the Bongo Club during the 2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. <i>Apocalypso Now</i> toured nationally, sometimes as part of a double-bill where Newman was joined by Mark Thomas.

He had problems with his right hand during his early amateur days and this made him depend more on his left hand. He had large reserves of stamina due to an abnormally slow heart rate, known as bradycardia, and he would use his left jab to score points whilst using his mobility to keep away from his opponent\\u2019s punches. This did not always lead to an attractive contest, and Cullen was not as popular outside his native North-East as his talent would seem to merit.</p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>He grew up in Wheatley Hill, County Durham, beginning work as an apprentice pipe fitter at the local colliery. He later move to nearby Shotton. He fought in National Coal Board boxing championships winning the featherweight title and later the lightweight title.</p>\\n<p>In 1959 he turned professional with his brother Terry as his manager. In his first professional fight, in November 1959 against Ricky Mcmasters, he won on points over six rounds.</p>\\n<p>For the next three years Cullen built up a record of 24 wins, 2 defeats and 2 draws. Of his wins in this period only one was by knockout and four by technical knockout.</p>\\n<h2>Title challenge</h2>\\n<p>Cullen\\u2019s record put him in line for a title challenge against the British lightweight champion, Dave Charnley. Charnley was a southpaw, who had held the British title since 1957, and had twice unsuccessfully fought for the world title. The fight took place on May 20, 1963 at Belle Vue, Manchester, and Charnley retained his title after fifteen rounds with a points decision. Cullen reportedly did not like fighting southpaws, but pushed Charnley all the way.</p>\\n<p>In October of the same year Carlos Ortiz, the Puerto Rican world lightweight champion, came to England for a ten-round non-title fight against Cullen at the Empire Pool, Wembley. Although Cullen was knocked down in the last round he hung on to lose on points, having given the world champion a hard fight.</p>\\n<h2>British champion</h2>\\n<p>In the meantime, Dave Charnley, had moved up to welterweight and finally retired in December 1964, leaving the British lightweight title vacant. Following his defeat to Carlos Ortiz, Cullen had had three successive victories, and so was in a good position to contest the vacant championship. He fought the Liverpudlian Dave Coventry at Liverpool Stadium in April 1965. Cullen spent fifteen rounds back-pedalling and poking his left jab into Coventy\\u2019s face without his opponent being able to do anything about it. This incensed some of the home crowd, who made their feeling clear, but Cullen easily gained the decision and became the new British lightweight champion.</p>\\n<p>Cullen fought two more bouts, gaining points victories before defending his title against Vic Andreeti, the Hoxton fighter whom he had beaten twice already. The bout was in November 1965 at Wolverhampton, and Cullen gained another fifteen-round points decision, although Andreeti and some of his supporters thought that he should have been given the decision.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q6792987\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":39521089,\"title\":\"Sir Hugh Evelyn, 5th Baronet\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Sir Hugh Evelyn, 5th Baronet</b> (31 January 1769 \\u2013 28 August 1848) was a British aristocrat.</p>\\n<h2>Family Background</h2>\\n<p>Hugh was the youngest son of Charles Evelyn, by Philippa Wright, the daughter of Fortunatus Wright, the privateer.

After graduating from Morehouse College with a BA in acting and philosophy, he moved to New York City to earn an MFA in acting from New York University's Graduate Acting Program at the Tisch School of the Arts.

The following year, Williams landed the lead role in the 1998 feature film <i>Slam</i>. Williams featured as both a writer and actor on the film, which would win both the Sundance Festival Grand Jury Prize and the Cannes Camera D'Or (Golden Camera).</p>\\n<h3>Music</h3>\\n<p>Around 1998, Williams was also breaking into music. He had performed with such artists as Nas, The Fugees, Christian Alvarez, Blackalicious, Erykah Badu, KRS-One, Zack De La Rocha, De La Soul, and DJ Krust, as well as poets Allen Ginsberg and Sonia Sanchez. After releasing a string of EPs, he released the LP <i>Amethyst Rock Star</i> with producer Rick Rubin in 2001. In September 2004, he released his self-titled album to much acclaim. He played several shows supporting Nine Inch Nails on their European tour in summer 2005, and has also supported The Mars Volta. Williams was invited to the Lollapalooza music festival around time, and the Chicago stage allowed Williams to attract a wider audience. He appeared on the Nine Inch Nails album <i>Year Zero</i>, and supported the group on their 2006 tour of North America. On the tour, Williams announced that Trent Reznor would co-produce his next album.</p>\\n<p>This collaboration resulted in 2007's <i>The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!</i>. The album was available only from its website until a physical CD was issued, featuring new tracks and extended album artwork.

The other option was for users to pay $5 to support the artist directly and be given the choice of downloading the higher-quality MP3 version or the lossless FLAC version.

It was Reznor who said, after his own recent dealings with record labels, that they should release it independently and directly to the audience.</p>\\n<p>In early 2008, a Nike Sparq Training commercial featured Williams' song \\\"List of Demands (Reparations)\\\".

Williams showcased the album at London's Hoxton Bar Kitchen on January 26, 2011. Livemusic interviewed Williams on the evening and made a subsequent film, produced by artist Alex Templeton-Ward. When Williams was asked what the point of poetry was, he said: \\\"I'm making this up, I have no idea but here we go. I think that it would be to express, to share, to relieve, to explore. For me, poetry offers some what of a cathartic experience. I am able to move through emotions and emotional experience particularly, you know, break-ups, difficulties in all the things that I may face, whether that is with an industry or a loved one or whomever, there needs to be an infiltration process, like you have a window open over there. That is the purpose of poetry: it is the window that opens, that allows some air in, some other insight, some other possibility so we can explore all that we feel, all that we think but with the space to see more than what we know, because there is so much more than we know. If I didn't open myself to the possibilities of the unknown, then I would be lost.\\\"</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/SaulWilliams07.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q533369\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":27719502,\"title\":\"VitaliV\",\"text\":\"<p><b>VitaliV</b> (or <b>Vitali V</b>, real name <b>Vitali Vinogradov</b>) is a British painter and sculptor who has developed an artistic style based on the designs of computer microchips.

He is also a former Chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, and has been active in UK politics.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Massow was born Ivan Field in Brighton, East Sussex. His relationships with his father and subsequently his stepfather were poor; as a boy he ended up being cared for by social services, before being adopted as a pre-teenager by a Mr John Massow. Commenting on his life prior to his adoption, Massow has stated that \\\"My life up to then is a bit of a blur. I had four different families, my name changed from Field to Mitchell to Massow, I was moved around for various reasons.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Massow is dyslexic and left school at 16 with one O-level in metalwork, with possibly others in photography and history, however information regarding his early qualifications is ambiguous, and Massow himself has commented that \\\"I lied about them so much, I can't remember what's actually true.\\\" He studied at Eastbourne for a BTEC in art and design, then moved to Bristol and was employed by an insurance firm. In 1990 Massow moved to London and started his own financial services business.</p>\\n<h2>Business career</h2>\\n<h3>Massow Financial Services</h3>\\n<p>In 1990 and with less than \\u00a35,000 Massow started Bowater Massow, later to become Massow Financial Services Ltd, running it initially from a squat in Kentish Town, London, using just a mobile phone. Massow specialised in offering financial services to gay people, in particular sourcing competitively priced insurance and mortgages for customers whose sexuality previously resulted in their being charged much higher premiums. Massow claims he was dismayed to see the prejudicial attitude within the insurance industry towards gay men and people with HIV and AIDS, hence \\\"what I decided to do was set up this company to try and help these people.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Accompanied by imaginative advertising that included a poster campaign depicting Massow embracing his then boyfriend, Massow's company soon attracted customers and expanded; the success and high profile of the business resulted in Massow being voted Man of the Year by the Pink Paper in 1996, and by 1997 Massow had become a multi-millionaire. At the end of the decade his company had several offices, including branches in Edinburgh, Manchester and Liverpool, and was at the forefront of the 'gay finance' sector.</p>\\n<p>At the end of 2000 Massow merged his company with another gay-orientated finance company, Rainbow Finance of Oxford, thereby creating Rainbow Massow, one of the largest independent financial advice firms in the UK. Massow took the role of Chairman and was superseded as Managing Director by Louis Letourneau, who had owned Rainbow Finance. The market value of the new company was \\u00a320M, and Massow claimed that turnover would rise from \\u00a32M per annum to over \\u00a33.5M. However within one year the firm ran out of money and went out of business. Shortly afterwards Massow described the decision to stop trading as \\\"the most terrible thing that has happened in my entire business life\\\".</p>\\n<p>Both parties blamed the other for the new firm's demise. Letourneau claimed that the merger had happened after Massow had endured two years of heavy losses (\\u00a3700,000 in 1998-99 and \\u00a3465,777 in 1999-2000), and that he (Letourneau) had been made a scapegoat for Massow's failures. He claimed that Massow's accounts had not been properly maintained and that Massow didn't fulfill promises of extra finance for expansion. He said \\\"the basic problem was that we were suffering from falling sales in a falling market and fundamentally we needed more funding. In my opinion [Massow] was quite happy to see it go into receivership and then buy it back cheaply.\\\" Massow claimed that Letourneau had incurred excessive costs on staff and offices, stating that new regional offices \\\"only had one person working in them yet they were stuffed full of brand new furniture and new photocopiers\\\" and that \\\"around half the costs of the company were going to pay the salaries of managers\\\". Massow eventually bought the company back from the receiver for about \\u00a31.5M and subsequently restabilised it.</p>\\n<h3>Jake</h3>\\n<p>In 2001 Massow set up Jake, an online social networking site for gay professionals.</p>\\n<h3>Allied Dunbar and Zurich</h3>\\n<p>Between 2003 and 2004 Massow was Director of another financial adviser firm, this time a tied agent of the Zurich Advice Network (previously Allied Dunbar). Massow had previously campaigned against what he saw as Allied Dunbar's anti-gay underwriting practices, but he claimed that \\\"they've moved on and, for the sake of my customers, so must I [...] if other gay financial advisers think they're doing the best for their customers by blackballing all the companies that were once out of line (there were about eight of them) when it came to gay issues - then their priorities are very strange. Financial advice is about getting the best product - not petty grudge bearing.\\\"  Massow accepted a transitional loan of \\u00a3330,000 to enable office relocation and staff training. However the arrangement was short-lived and ironically ended after a dispute between Massow and Zurich over Zurich's approach to insuring the gay clients in which the firm specialised. A long \\u00a313m legal case followed which, ultimately, Massow lost.</p>\\n<h3>Pay Me My</h3>\\n<p>In September 2011 Massow set up <i>Pay Me My</i>, a trading name of Massows Limited, which offered customers a rebate of 80% of the 'trail' commission paid to their existing advisers if the customer switched their insurance, pension and investment policies to the agency of Pay Me My, who would take 20% as their fee. Massow defended the business model of the firm from suggestions that it would not be viable following changes to financial regulation in the U.K. due to start on 1 January 2013, however, it ceased trading in August 2013 after it announced that its business model was loss making and could not be sustained. The firm informed its clients that, should they choose to remain with the company, all future trail commissions would be retained and not rebated. This action was unpopular with customers, therefore Massow agreed to sell the remaining assets under management to Clubfinance, who would continue rebating the majority of their commission.</p>\\n<h3>Others</h3>\\n<p>Other Massow businesses include <i>Halos and Horns</i> and <i>Massows Angels</i>.</p>\\n<h2>Contemporary art</h2>\\n<p>In 1999, Massow became Chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. He was brought in by Director Philip Dodd to increase sponsorship and patronage for the organisation. Dodd claimed that Massow was a \\\"mass of contradictions, just like the ICA. He's a risky choice for us, but the ICA should always live dangerously.\\\" However the working relationship between Massow and Dodd subsequently proved to be not wholly successful, as Dodd increasingly disliked Massow's knack for self-promotion and perceived him to be taking over the role of being the organisation's public face.</p>\\n<p>The situation deteriorated irreparably when in January 2002 Massow wrote an article in <i>New Statesman</i> magazine, attacking the predominance of conceptual art in the art world. He described modern concept art as \\\"pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat\\\" and \\\"the product of over-indulged, middle-class [...], bloated egos who patronise real people with fake understanding\\\". He called the ICA a \\\"pillar of the shock establishment\\\". He attacked Tracey Emin saying she \\\"couldn't think her way out of a paper bag\\\", though he admitted this comment was \\\"a little below the belt\\\".</p>\\n<p>In February 2002, Massow resigned as Chairman of the ICA, after the board unanimously requested him to. Board member Ekow Eshun was quoted in <i>The Guardian</i> as saying \\\"I have no problem with Ivan bringing up this debate. But Ivan has been ramping up the story all week. I think he's been a little bit of a pillock.\\\". There was speculation that Massow had deliberately been as provocative as possible in order to engineer his own sacking. Massow claims he spoke out in order to redress the imbalance between the promotion of conceptual and more traditional art in the British art scene.</p>\\n<p>His views have engendered strong feelings about him amongst the art world; a year after his resignation one artist commented that \\\"they treat him like the Black Death round here\\\", although Massow has received less vocal support from many artists who fear they will never achieve recognition unless they follow the conceptual route.</p>\\n<p>Massow collects figurative contemporary art and claims that he visits art colleges and artists' studios regularly. In a 2003 interview he stated that \\\"I visit at least one a week, quietly, on my own. It helps to see how people work. How they define themselves. I rarely buy from galleries.\\\" Massow has had his portrait painted nearly 30 times, including a double nude diptych by Jonathan Yeo, son of Conservative MP Tim Yeo. Massow has personally provided regular financial support for some artists, to assist them in their lives and work.</p>\\n<h2>Politics</h2>\\n<p>Massow was first attracted to the politics of the Conservative Party when he was a boy. He joined his local Young Conservatives and at age 14 became its chairman, the youngest in the country at the time.</p>\\n<p>In the 1990s Massow's flatmates were for a time former Conservative Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove, and MP and former head of Conservative policy Nicholas Boles, a situation Massow described as \\\"Tory Friends\\\".</p>\\n<p>However Massow, along with many espousing \\\"compassionate conservatism\\\", was frustrated by the Party's apparent reluctance to alter its stance on gay rights issues and discrimination in general. In 2000, following John Bercow MP's resignation from the front bench and the defection of Shaun Woodward MP to Labour, Massow too left the Conservative Party to join the Labour Party, where he was welcomed by Mo Mowlam. However Massow later returned to the Conservatives, subsequently claiming that the brief defection to Labour had a particular motivation: \\\"I knew if I switched it would be front page news. I thought it would help the party focus on repealing Section 28. I had one meeting with Labour, that's all. I never wanted to be a candidate.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Massow is currently head of the Conservative Technology Initiative for London.</p>\\n<p>In November 2014, he became the first Conservative to declare their plan to seek the Tory party's candidacy to become Mayor of London at the 2016 elections.</p>\\n<h2>Media</h2>\\n<p>In November 2005, Massow was the winning mentor on Channel 4's <i>Make Me a Million</i>.</p>\\n<p>Massow produced the film <i>Banksy's Coming For Dinner</i>, starring Joan Collins.</p>\\n<h2>Charity work</h2>\\n<p>Massow Financial Services was the first mainstream business to sponsor London's Gay Pride in 1990 which it continued to do in subsequent years.</p>\\n<p>Massow has raised funds for charity and founded the April Bombing Appeal for victims of the April 1999 nail-bombings in Soho, Brixton and Brick Lane in London. Massow Financial Services collected donations for the appeal.</p>\\n<p>In March 2010, in partnership with Oxfam and Beat That Quote, Massow developed <i>Compare for Good</i>, a charity fundraising price comparison website which promised to pay more than two thirds of the money raised by the site to Oxfam. In March 2011 beatthatquote.com was sold to Google.</p>\\n<h2>Personal life</h2>\\n<p>Massow is openly gay.

Attended art schools at Nottingham, Wolverhampton, Goldsmiths and the Slade School of Fine Art.</p>\\n<h2>Pun-sculptures</h2>\\n<p>Vaughan Grylls was a developer of Conceptual art, in which the idea of a work of art, rather than its form, is the dominant principle. Grylls' particular contribution was the 'pun-sculpture': the meanings of these works \\u2013\\u2013 as in the 'assisted ready-mades' of Marcel Duchamp and the 'objects' of Man Ray \\u2013\\u2013 derive from the interplay of the verbal and the visual.</p>\\n<p>At Goldsmiths' College in 1968, Grylls produced an exhibition of his first pun-sculptures, each made from cardboard and called collectively 'Ludwig Wittgenstein's Palace of Pun'. He took this with him to the Slade and continued to make more pun-sculptures. His work was noticed at his final show in 1970 by Jasia Reichardt, art critic and assistant director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA). She offered Grylls his first gallery show in London. It was held at the ICA in October 1970 as one room in an exhibition entitled 'Ten Sitting Rooms'. Works shown by Grylls at the ICA included 'A Case for Wittgenstein' (two white suitcases on one of which he had scrawled 'I brought this in Case' and on the other screened a photograph of the first case with 'A Case for Wittgenstein' by Vaughan Grylls' printed underneath in large black letters) and 'The Wittgenstein Lectern' (a black and white sculpture shaped as a lectern with a spoof linguistic philosophy question and answer examination paper scrawled on the top in black felt pen e.g. Question: Why are words used? Answer: Philosofreasons.</p>\\n<p>In October 1970 in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i>, the art critic Michael Shepherd described Grylls works as having 'delicious verbal wit.'  In the October 1970 edition of <i>Arts Review</i> the art critic Peter Fuller observed that Vaughan Grylls' work was 'poker-faced'. In November 1970 Grylls showed 'Headcase, Bookcase' at the Young Contemporaries which was held that year at the Royal Academy. Grylls' work consisted of a life-sized photograph of himself lying in front of a spoof library with punning titles written on the spines of the books. 'Headcase, Bookcase' was awarded the Marlborough Gallery Prize. The following year Vaughan Grylls set up a pun-sculpture in the form of a one-person exhibition at the Greenwich Theatre Gallery. In <i>The Guardian</i>, the art critic Caroline Tisdall described it as 'an exhibition of an exhibition' further explaining that it included ' some critical judgment \\u2013 2 clever x 1/2 \\u2013 and mock philosophical asides \\\"Deep down most people are shallow' '. A visitor to the exhibition subsequently added in lipstick to that particular work, 'Well you should know'. This was not the first time the public had reacted to a Grylls pun-sculpture or used lipstick in doing so. In May 1970 a passer-by had torn off part of Grylls large work 'The Emperor's New Clothes' which was showing outside Euston Station as part of the Camden Festival. The object the passer-by removed could be seen as a leaf on one side, on which Grylls had written 'see overleaf' and a penis on the other. The passer-by left his name and address adding that he had vandalised Grylls work on the grounds of its decadence.'</p>\\n<p>In July 1970 Vaughan Grylls showed a large bed-shaped sculpture in Paternoster Square as part of the City of London Festival. It was chosen by Peter Fuller who was organising the Festival's art exhibition. The bed-head consisted of a photo enlargement of a sugary love-scene copied from the magazine 'Womans Own'. At one end of the 'bedspread', made from a white plasticated sheet of wood, Grylls had written 'A Woman's Own Eye View of the World' and on the other 'A Woman's Eye-Level View of the World'. This provoked several responses in lipstick from women. In the Summer of 1971 Vaughan Grylls showed several life-sized photographs throughout Alexandra Palace as his contribution to the exhibition 'Art Spectrum'. The photographs consisted of Grylls standing in front of other artists' submitted work. Some of the works Grylls photographed were subsequently rejected which meant that there were artists who found their work rejected from the show yet a life-sized photograph of their work included with Grylls standing pointing at it.</p>\\n<h2>The Gallery 65a Lisson Street NW1</h2>\\n<p>The Gallery had been set up in 1972 by fellow Slade graduate Nicholas Wegner (now sometimes known as Nick P. James or N. P. James). Before Grylls arrival, Wegner had been showing invented artists, a group of whom had been exhibited unwittingly at the ICA. Wegner invited Grylls to show at The Gallery. The work Grylls exhibited in 1973 entitled 'An Indo-Chinese Punsculpture' was a large photo-mural commenting on the signing of the so-called Paris Peace Treaty. Although a pun-sculpture it marked Grylls return to overtly political subject matter, something he had not undertaken since 1964, when as a student at Wolverhampton he had constructed a 2.5-metre high fibreglass sculpture Ku Klux Klan as a response to the 1964 racially-charged General Election in that city.</p>\\n<p>After showing 'An Indo-Chinese Pun-Sculpture', Grylls joined Nicholas Wegner as co-director of The Gallery. Together they travelled to the 7th Cologne Art Fair where Grylls photographed the commercial dealers operating in their temporary, standardised 'galleries'. On their return Wegner and Grylls transformed the layout of The Gallery into one exactly mirroring those at Cologne. The Gallery, at Grylls's suggestion, was renamed The Gallery London. This design was to remain unchanged for the rest of The Gallery/The Gallery London's operating life. Grylls and Wegner's first exhibition together consisted of a selection of the photographs taken at Cologne. Following this, 'Display exhibitions' were invented. These were based on a modular system of photo-stands and wall-based units. Subjects such as 'Drug Abuse in Maine', 'The Floods in Egypt', 'Mine', 'Contemporary Art', 'Belfast in Art and 'Photography Hasselblad' were shown. Thus The Gallery London replaced the invented artist with no artist. Grylls stated later in a radio interview with Anthea Lahr broadcast on ''WBAI New York <i>that 'a bland corporate-style presentation, used for each and every show was inspired by my first visit to America in 1973 where I was impressed by The Kodak Galleries with their huge attention to presentation and none to content'. In 1974\\u201375 Grylls and Wegner invited other artists to collaborate by showing their works in the presentation format of The Gallery London e.g. John Latham, Gerald Newman and Rita Donagh. Caroline Tisdall in</i> The Guardian <i>wrote of this period \\\" The Gallery (65a Lisson Street NW1) continues its enterprising programme of processing and packaging. This has by now become the closest to a house style that any London gallery has.\\\" The French art historian, Pierre Rouve, wrote in Arts Review \\\"A minute, ascetic Gallery seems to have succeeded where majestic public institutions have sadly failed: to walk safely along the perilous tightrope stretched between percepts and concepts.\\\" In May 1975 Grylls objected to Wegner hanging Rita Donagh's working drawing for The Gallery London's</i> 'Rita Donagh' display next to the display itself and afterwards selling the drawing. In Grylls view these actions could be regarded as turning the enterprise into a conventional gallery. As the dispute could not be resolved satisfactorily, Grylls left The Gallery London. Wegner continued with Display exhibitions and other shows until 1978.</p>\\n<p>In 2006 The Centre of Attention re-presented a selection of radical galleries, publications and television shows covering the period 1956\\u20132006 in a survey exhibition entitled 'Fast and Loose (my dead gallery)'. This was shown at the Fieldgate Gallery London at the same time as the Frieze Art Fair. The exhibition featured several enterprises from the period including the Indica Gallery, the Women's Art Library, Make, BANK and The Gallery. In 2007 in the art magazine <i>Art on Paper</i>, New York City, the art critic Sarah Andress wrote 'In one of two rooms dedicated to The Gallery (1972\\u20131978) hung six large photographs of other galleries' booths at the 1973 Cologne Kunstmarkt. after which the Gallery's directors remodelled their space. A book of photographs of Frieze 2006 sat on a table in that room, a subtle reminder of how truly prescient the Gallery's project really was.'</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q7917286\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":4295998,\"title\":\"Franko B\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Franko B</b> (born <b>Franco Bosisio</b> in Milan in 1960) is an Italian performance artist based in London.

It is bounded by the Hackney districts of Stamford Hill to the west, Lower Clapton and Lea Bridge to the south and the Haringey district of South Tottenham to the north. To the east is the River Lea (spelled Lea or Lee), on the other side of which is the expanse of the Walthamstow Marshes, part of which is in the Lee Valley Park.</p>\\n<p>As is frequently the case with London districts, these boundaries have become uncertain because of the meeting of the developing expansion of the original settlements. Western parts of the area are often considered part of a wider Stamford Hill, understandable perhaps because of the public transport junction and shopping area at Stamford Broadway, and that the Hassidic Jewish community identified as being located in Stamford Hill extends into Upper Clapton.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>Clapton was from 1339 until the 18th century normally rendered as <i>Clopton</i>, meaning the \\\"farm on the hill\\\". The Old English <i>clop</i> - \\\"lump\\\" or \\\"hill\\\" - presumably denoted the high ground which rises from the River Lea. Eventually encompassing the north-eastern quarter of the parish, Clapton grew up along the way which in 1745 was called Hackney Lane, part of which ran through Broad (later Clapton) Common. Building spread to meet streets east of the high road and north of Homerton in the 19th century. Manorial courts from the early 19th century distinguished the parts north and south of Lea Bridge Road as Upper and Lower Clapton, and those names soon passed into general use. Hackney Lane came to be known as Lower and Upper Clapton roads, until in the late 19th century the stretch through the common to Stamford Hill was named Clapton Common.</p>\\n<p>The area, along with Lower Clapton, was known in the 1990s and early 2000s for drug and gun related crimes, gaining it the nickname \\\"Murder Mile.\\\" As well as being featured in the film <i>Bullet Boy</i>, Clapton's reputation was highlighted in an episode of Channel 4's satirical TV show <i>Brass Eye</i> in 1997, which claimed that the petrol station is shoplifted every 30 minutes.</p>\\n<h2>Local features</h2>\\n<h3>On the waterfront</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the most pleasant amenities in Upper Clapton is Springfield Park, which extends down the hill eastwards to the Lea. This park was created in 1905 from the extensive grounds of three mansions, of which only one survives: Springfield House, now known as the White House (a Grade II listed house ), houses a caf\\u00e9 and the municipal rangers' station. The park's sports facilities include five tennis courts and a cricket pitch, while to the north, just across Spring Hill in the recreation ground, there are rugby fields (home of the Hackney RUFC), more tennis courts, and football pitches. Across the Lea, on the ancient Essex and modern London Borough of Waltham Forest border, is Springfield Marina, a packed mooring for narrowboats and other waterway craft, while on the other bank of the river is the Lea Rowing Club.</p>\\n<p>The park received a Green Flag award in July 2008.</p>\\n<p>Aside from the mansion, another \\u2014 and very popular \\u2014 survivor is the Anchor and Hope pub, which is not far from the south-east corner of the park. The area along the Lea was heavily bombed in the Second World War, and the pub is one of the few survivors of the terraced housing that once dominated the area. It is now quite overshadowed by pre- and post-war blocks of flats.</p>\\n<p>Besides Springfield Park, Upper Clapton is delineated to the west by the long leafy strip of Clapton Common, distinguished by the recently regenerated pond (the name Clapton Pond, however, is generally applied by locals to a set of two much smaller ex-reservoirs in Lower Clapton, and bus routes that use Clapton Pond as a terminus point are referring to Lower Clapton). The pond is a favourite with bird watchers \\u2014 besides the usual variety of ducks, geese and swans, such shy birds as grebes and other waders may often be seen feeding in the reed beds.</p>\\n<h3>The Abode of Love</h3>\\n\\n<p>Upper Clapton is home to one of London's more unusual churches, the Church of the Good Shepherd, which was used as a place of worship by the Ancient Catholic Church and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church. However, the church was originally built by the Agapemonite cult in 1892 as the Church of the Ark of the Covenant.</p>\\n<p>The Agapemonites, who held decidedly unconventional views on marriage and the role of women, relocated to Upper Clapton from their spiritual community in Spaxton, Somerset, and had clearly prospered by this time. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, the outside of the church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth from the base of the steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J S Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'.</p>\\n<p>The church, which was completed in 1895, was designed by Joseph Morris in a Gothic Revival style; for its \\\"curiosity value\\\" it was designated a Grade II-listed building on 12 September 1969.</p>\\n\\n<p>The cult had always been surrounded by scandal during its sojourn in Somerset and, after the move to Clapton, this degenerated into sheer farce. The original leader, Henry James Prince, who claimed to be immortal, died in 1899 and was succeeded by the charming but philandering John Hugh Smyth-Pigott, who wasted no time before declaring himself as the Messiah. Challenged by a jeering mob to prove his godhood by walking across Clapton Pond, Smyth-Pigott declined and retired to Somerset, where he was said to enjoy the favours of as many as seven \\\"spiritual brides\\\" a week. Smyth-Pigott, who also claimed immortality, died in 1927, after which the cult went into decline. The Clapton church had already been abandoned by the cult and was acquired first by the Ancient Catholic Church in 1956, and then by the Georgian Orthodox Church in 2005.</p>\\n<h3>The New Synagogue</h3>\\n\\n<p>Close by the Good Shepherd is the stately New Synagogue, on the eastern side of Clapton Common. This Grade II listed building is a little deceptive, appearing much older than it actually is. In spite of its handsome Georgian-style exterior, this is actually post-Edwardian, built in 1915. It is, however, a faithful replica of an earlier building, the Great St Helen's Synagogue in the City of London, which was designed by John Davies in 1838. The current building contains a number of original fixtures from its predecessor. Endangered for a while, the synagogue was restored in 2005.</p>\\n<h3>Brooke House</h3>\\n\\n<p>A large house known as the King's House stood on the site now occupied by BSix Sixth Form College, as early 1476. The house was within a 200-acre (0.81\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) estate, which was described as the Manor of Hackney from about 1532 to the early 17th century \\u2014 although there were two other manors in the south of the Parish.</p>\\n<p>In 1532, Henry Algernon Percy, Earl of Northumberland, acquired the estate from Sir Richard Neville. However, in January 1535 the land was taken by Henry VIII; in settlement of a debt. The King visited the house in April 1535 and on 24 September 1535 he granted his \\\"manor or principal messuage of Hackney\\\" to Thomas Cromwell, his chief minister. Cromwell refurbished the house, and on 1 May 1536, returned the house to the King. In July 1536, Ralph Sadleir brought Mary I of England to the house to swear the Oath of Supremacy before her father, and Jane Seymour, the Queen. Henry continued to own the house until his death in January 1547. Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, died in the house in Hackney known as the \\\"King's House\\\" on 24 June 1604.</p>\\n<p>The name of the house derives from its purchase by Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke, in 1621 \\u2014 which led to ownership by the family for over 200 years. The house became tenanted after 1724, but in 1758\\u20139 the house was modified by a leasee, William Clarke who converted it to a lunatic asylum. The site remained in this use until 1940.</p>\\n<p>The remains of the house were destroyed by enemy action in October 1940. 5.5 acres (0.02\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) of Brooke House were purchased by the London County Council in 1944, and further bomb damage occurred that year. The house was finally demolished in 1954, and archaeological investigations of the Tudor palace took place in 1955\\u20136. New school buildings were erected in 1960, designed by Armstrong and MacManus.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>BSix Sixth Form College is a sixth form college on a site near the Lea Bridge roundabout in Clapton.</p>\\n<h2>Transport and locale</h2>\\n\\n<p>About 2 miles by bus, the nearest London Underground stations are Tottenham Hale, Manor House and Seven Sisters.</p>\\n<dl><dt>Nearest railway stations</dt>\\n</dl><ul><li>Clapton</li>\\n<li>Hackney Central</li>\\n<li>South Tottenham</li>\\n<li>Stamford Hill</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>History of Clapton (British History Online)</li>\\n<li>Clapton at freeservers.com</li>\\n<li>The Lee Valley Park</li>\\n<li>The Spark Caf\\u00e9</li>\\n<li>BSix College Brooke House Website</li>\\n<li>The Clapton Messiah The Agapemonites - Clapton Pond Neighbourhood Action Group</li>\\n<li>The Agapemonites - Clapton Freeservers</li>\\n<li>The New Synagogue (from oldsynagogues.org - shows the impressive interior)</li>\\n</ul>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Greater_London_UK_location_map_2.svg\",\"people\":[{\"pageid\":3635871,\"title\":\"Doug Insole\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Douglas John Insole</b> CBE (born 18 April 1926, Clapton, London) is a former English cricketer, who played for Cambridge University, Essex and in nine Test matches for England, five of them on the 1956-57 tour of South Africa, where he was vice-captain to Peter May.

Located 3.3 miles (5.3\\u00a0km) northeast of Charing Cross, it was historically an agrarian hamlet in the ancient parish of Stepney, Middlesex.</p>\\n<p>Following population increases caused by the expansion of London during the 18th century, it was split off from Stepney as the parish of Bethnal Green in 1743, becoming part of the Metropolis in 1855 and the County of London in 1889. The parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green in 1900 and the population peaked in 1901, entering a period of steady decline which lasted until 1981.</p>\\n<p>The economic history of Bethnal Green is characterised by a shift away from agricultural provision for the City of London to market gardening, weaving and light industry, which has now all but disappeared. The quality of the built environment had deteriorated by the turn of the 20th century and was radically reformed by the aerial bombardment of World War II and the subsequent social housing developments. Some 173 people were killed at a single incident at Bethnal Green tube station in 1943. Bethnal Green has formed part of Greater London since 1965.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>Toponymy</h3>\\n<p>The place-name <i>Blithehale</i> or <i>Blythenhale</i>, the earliest form of Bethnal Green, is derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>healh</i> ('angle, nook, or corner') and <i>blithe</i> ('happy, blithe'), or from a personal name <i>Blitha</i>. Nearby Cambridge Heath (<i>Camprichesheth</i>), is unconnected with Cambridge and may also derive from an Anglo-Saxon personal name. The area was once marshland and forest which, as <i>Bishopswood</i>, lingered in the east until the 16th century. A settlement's dependence upon water suggests that the 'happy corner' was cleared next to the natural spring, St. Winifred's Well, in Conduit Field at the northern end of the Green. Over time, the name became <i>Bethan Hall Green</i>, which, because of local pronunciation as <i>Beth'n 'all Green</i>, had by the 19th century changed to <i>Bethnal Green</i>.</p>\\n<h3>Early History</h3>\\n\\n<p>A Tudor ballad, the <i>Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i>, tells the story of an ostensibly poor man who gave a surprisingly generous dowry for his daughter's wedding. The tale furnishes the parish of Bethnal Green's coat of arms. According to one version of the legend, found in Percy's <i>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</i> published in 1765, the beggar was said to be Henry, the son of Simon de Montfort, but Percy himself declared that this version was not genuine. The Blind Beggar public house in Whitechapel is reputed to be the site of his begging.</p>\\n<p>Boxing has a long association with Bethnal Green. Daniel Mendoza, who was champion of England from 1792 to 1795 though born in Aldgate, lived in Paradise Row on the western side of Bethnal Green for 30 years. Since then numerous boxers have been associated with the area, and the local leisure centre, York Hall, remains notable for presentation of boxing bouts.</p>\\n<p>In 1841, the Anglo-Catholic Nathaniel Woodard, who was to become a highly influential educationalist in the later part of the 19th century, became the curate of the newly created St. Bartholomew's in Bethnal Green. He was a capable pastoral visitor and established a parochial school. In 1843, he got into trouble for preaching a sermon in St. Bartholomew's in which he argued that <i>the Book of Common Prayer</i> should have additional material to provide for confession and absolution and in which he criticised the 'inefficient and Godless clergy' of the Church of England. After examining the text of the sermon, the Bishop of London condemned it as containing 'erroneous and dangerous notions'. As a result, the bishop sent Woodard to be a curate in Clapton.</p>\\n<h3>The Green and Poor's Land</h3>\\n<p>The Green and Poor's Land is the area of open land now occupied by Bethnal Green Library, the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood and St John's Church, designed by John Soane. In Stow's <i>Survey of London</i> (1598) the hamlet was called <i>Blethenal Green</i>, now called <i>Bethnal Green</i>. It was one of the hamlets included in the Manor of Stepney and Hackney. Hackney later became separated.</p>\\n<p>In 1678 the owners of houses surrounding the Green purchased the land to save it from being built on and in 1690 the land was conveyed to a trust under which it was to be kept open and rent from it used for the benefit of poor people living in the vicinity. From that date until now the trust has administered the land and its minute books are kept in the London Metropolitan Archives.</p>\\n<p>Bethnal House, or Kirby's Castle, was the principal house on the Green. One of its owners was Sir Hugh Platt (1552\\u20131608), author of books on gardening and practical science. Under its next owner it was visited by Samuel Pepys. It became associated with the ballad of the Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (see Thomas Percy).</p>\\n<p>In 1727 it was leased to Matthew Wright and for almost two centuries it was a mad house. Its two most distinguished inmates were Alexander Cruden, compiler of the <i>Concordance to the Bible</i>, and the poet Christopher Smart. Cruden recorded his experience in <i>The London Citizen Grievously Injured</i> (1739) and Smart's stay there is recorded by his daughter. Records of the asylum are kept in the annual reports of the Commissioner in Lunacy. Even today, the park where the library stands is known locally as \\u201cBarmy Park\\u201d.</p>\\n<p>The original mansion, the White House, was supplemented by other buildings. In 1891 the Trust lost the use of Poor's Land to the London County Council. The asylum reorganised its buildings, demolishing the historic White House and erecting a new block in 1896. This building became the present Bethnal Green Library. A history of Poor's Land and Bethnal House is included in <i>The Green</i> (A.J. Robinson and D.H.B. Chesshyre).</p>\\n<h3>Other houses on the Green</h3>\\n<p>The north end of the Green is associated with the Natt family. During the 18th century they owned many of its houses. Netteswell House is the residence of the curator of the Bethnal Green Museum. It is almost certainly named after the village of Netteswell, near Harlow, whose rector was the Rev. Anthony Natt. A few of its houses have become University settlements. In Victoria Park Square, on the east side of the Green, No.18 has a Tudor well in its cellar.</p>\\n<h2>Globe Town</h2>\\n<h3>History</h3>\\n<p>To the east of Bethnal Green (and west of Bow and north of Stepney Green) lies <b>Globe Town</b>, established from 1800 to provide for the expanding population of weavers around Bethnal Green attracted by improving prospects in silk weaving. The population of Bethnal Green trebled between 1801 and 1831, operating 20,000 looms in their own homes. By 1824, with restrictions on importation of French silks relaxed, up to half these looms became idle and prices were driven down. With many importing warehouses already established in the district, the abundance of cheap labour was turned to boot, furniture and clothing manufacture. Globe Town continued its expansion into the 1860s, long after the decline of the silk industry.</p>\\n<h3>Today</h3>\\n<p>Today Globe Town is presented with three globe sculptures situated in three different corners of the town with it town centre called Globe Town Market Square located to the north on Roman Road next to the Cranbooke Estate. The area is home to a large Bangladeshi community. However it is mostly seen outside Globe Town and Bethnal Green as just a part of Bethnal Green and Stepney Green.</p>\\n<h3>Transport</h3>\\n<p>This area as with greater Bethnal Green is served by <i>Bethnal Green</i> as well as <i>Stepney Green</i>. London Buses routes 309 serves the heart of Globe Town with 8, D6 and night route N8 on the north on Roman Road and 25, 205 and N205 on Mile End Road in Stepney Green to the south.</p>\\n<h2>Modern history</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The silk-weaving trade spread eastwards from Spitalfields throughout the 18th century. This attracted many Huguenot and Irish weavers to the district. Large estates of small two story cottages were developed in the west of the area to house them. A downturn in the trade in 1769 led to the Spitalfield Riots, and on 6 December 1769, two weavers accused of 'cutting' were hanged in front of the <i>Salmon and Ball</i> public house.</p>\\n<p>In the 19th century, Bethnal Green remained characterised by its market gardens and by weaving. Having been an area of large houses and gardens as late as the 18th century, by about 1860 Bethnal Green was mainly full of tumbledown old buildings with many families living in each house. By the end of the century, Bethnal Green was one of the poorest slums in London. Jack the Ripper operated at the western end of Bethnal Green and in neighbouring Whitechapel. In 1900, the <i>Old Nichol Street Rookery</i> was demolished, and the Boundary Estate opened on the site near the boundary with Shoreditch. This was the world's first council housing, and brothers Lew Grade and Bernard Delfont were brought up here. In 1909, the Bethnal Green Estate was built with money left by the philanthropist William Richard Sutton which he left for 'modern dwellings and houses for occupation by the poor of London and other towns and populous places in England'.</p>\\n<p>On 3 March 1943 at 8:27PM the unopened Bethnal Green tube station was the site of a wartime disaster. Families had crowded into the underground station due to an air raid siren at 8:17, one of 10 that day. There was a panic at 8:27 coinciding with the sound of an anti-aircraft battery (possibly the recently installed Z battery) being fired at nearby Victoria Park. In the wet, dark conditions the crowd was surging forward towards the shelter when a woman tripped on the stairs, causing many others to fall. Within a few seconds 300 people were crushed into the tiny stairwell, resulting in 173 deaths. Although a report was filed by Eric Linden with the <i>Daily Mail</i>, who witnessed it, it never ran. The story which was reported instead was that there had been a direct hit by a German bomb. The results of the official investigation were not released until 1946. There is now a plaque at the entrance to the tube station which commemorates it as the worst civilian disaster of World War II, and funds are being raised for a memorial. It is estimated that during WWII, 80\\u00a0tons of bombs fell on the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green, affecting 21,700 houses, destroying 2,233 and making a further 893 uninhabitable. There were a total of 555 people killed and 400 seriously injured. Many unexploded bombs remain in the area, and on Monday 14 May 2007, builders discovered a World War II 1 m long 500\\u00a0lb (230\\u00a0kg) bomb.</p>\\n<p>The book <i>Family and Kinship in East London,</i> based on materials gathered in the 1950s, shows an improvement in working-class life. Husbands in the sample population no longer went out to drink but spent time with the family. As a result, both birth rate and infant death rate fell drastically and local prosperity increased. It is true that the infamous gangsters the Kray twins lived in Bethnal Green in the 1960s. However, by the beginning of the 21st century, Bethnal Green and much of the old East End began to undergo a process of gentrification.</p>\\n<p>The former Bethnal Green Infirmary, later the London County Council Bethnal Green Hospital, stood opposite Cambridge Heath railway station. The hospital closed as a public hospital in the 1970s and was a geriatric hospital under the NHS until the 1980s. Much of the site was developed for housing in the 1990s but the hospital entrance and administration block remains as a listed building. Marcus Garvey was at one time buried here, before his body was returned to Jamaica. The Albion Rooms are located in Bethnal Green where Pete Doherty and Carl Bar\\u00e2t of the Libertines used to live when the band was together. It became part of music history as the band would hold Guerilla Gigs in the flat that would be packed with people.</p>\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n\\n<p>Bethnal Green forms a part of Tower Hamlets and Hackney, centred around the Central line tube station at the junction of Bethnal Green Road, Roman Road and Cambridge Heath Road.</p>\\n<p>The district is associated with the E2 postcode district, but this also covers parts of Shoreditch, Haggerston and Cambridge Heath. Between 1986 and 1992, the name <i>Bethnal Green</i> was applied to one of seven neighbourhoods to whom power was devolved from the council. This resulted in replacement of much of the street signage in the area that remains in place. This included parts of both Cambridge Heath and Whitechapel (north of the Whitechapel Road) being more associated with the post code and administrative simplicity than the historic districts.</p>\\n<h2>Demographics</h2>\\n<p>Bethnal Green had a total population of 25,440 at the 2001 census, based on the north and south wards of Bethnal Green. The largest single ethnic group is people of Bangladeshi descent, which constitute 41 per cent of the area's population, every year since 1999 the Baishakhi Mela is celebrated in Weavers Field, Bethnal Green which celebrates the Bengali New Year. The second largest are the White British, constituting 37 per cent of the area's population. Other ethnic groups include Somalis, Black Africans and Black Caribbeans.</p>\\n<h2>Religion</h2>\\n<p>The two main faiths of the people are Islam and Christianity, with 50 per cent Muslim and 34 per cent Christians.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are many historical churches in Bethnal Green. Notable churches include, St John on Bethnal Green, located near the Bethnal Green tube station, on Bethnal Green Road and Roman Road. The church was built from 1826 to 1828 by the architect John Soane. Other notable churches include St Matthew - built by George Dance the Elder in 1746. St Matthew is the mother church of Bethnal Green; the church's opening coincided with a vast population increase in the former village of Stepney, resulting in the need to separate the area around Bethnal Green from the mother Parish of St Dunstan's, Stepney. All but the bell tower, still standing today, was destroyed by fire and the church again suffered devastating damage during the bombing campaigns of the Second World War, resulting in the installation of a temporary church within the bombed-out building. St. Matthew's remains a major beacon of the local East End community and is frequented on Sundays and other religious occasions by a mixture of established locals and more recent migrants to the area.</p>\\n<p>Other churches include St Peter's (1841) and St James-the-Less (1842), both by Lewis Vulliamy, St James the Great by Edward Blore (1843), and St Bartholomew by William Railton (1844). The church attendance in Bethnal Green was 1 in 8 people since 1900, and is estimated around 100 people attend church today (only 10% attend regularly in the UK). Baptisms, marriages and burials have been deposited nearly at all churches in Bethnal Green.</p>\\n<p>There are four Islamic mosques or places of worship in Bethnal Green for the Muslim community. These are the Baitul Aman Mosque and Cultural Centre, Darul Hadis Latifiah, the Senegambian Islamic Cultural Centre and the Globe Town Mosque and Cultural Centre.</p>\\n<p>The London Buddhist Centre, at 51 Roman Road, is one of the largest urban Buddhist centres in the west, and is the focus of a large Buddhist residential and business community in the area.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>Bethnal Green has numerous primary schools serving children aged three to 11. St. Matthias School on Bacon Street, off Brick Lane, is over a century old and uses the Seal of the old Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green as its badge and emblem. The school is over a century old but underwent extensive remodelling in 1994 and added a new sports hall on its Granby Street former playground site in 2006. The school is linked with the nearby 18th century St. Matthew's Church on St. Matthew's Row; pupils attend mass and perform seasonal plays and performances at the church and the Parish reverend provides religious instruction at the school. The Bangabandhu Primary School, named after the father of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujib, a non-selective state community school, was opened in January 1989, moved to a new building in November 1991, and has over 450 pupils. 70% of the school's pupils speak English as a second language, with a majority speaking Sylheti, a dialect of Bengali, at home, but the Ofsted inspectorate deemed Bangabandhu a \\\"successful and effective school\\\" where pupils \\\"achieve well and make good progress\\\".</p>\\n<p>Bethnal Green's oldest secondary school is Raine's Foundation School, with sites on Old Bethnal Green and Approach roads, a voluntary aided Anglican school founded in 1719. The school relocated several times, amalgamating with St. Jude's School  to become coeducational in 1977. Other schools in the area include Bethnal Green Academy, Oaklands School, and Morpeth School.</p>\\n<p>The V&amp;A Museum of Childhood on Cambridge Heath Road houses the child related objects of the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>\\n<p>The Bethnal Park (also known as Barmey Park) and Bethnal Green Library provide leisure facilities and information.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<h3>Rail</h3>\\n<p>The nearest station is <i>Bethnal Green</i> for London Underground and <i>Bethnal Green</i> (not to be confused with the Tube station of the same name) next to Whitechapel and <i>Cambridge Heath</i> in Cambridge Heath for National Rail.</p>\\n<h3>Buses</h3>\\n<p>London Buses 8, 26, 48, 55, 106, 254, 309, 388, D3, D6, N8, N55, N253 all operate within the area.</p>\\n<h3>Roads</h3>\\n<p>Bethnal Green is connected to the National Road Network with the north-south Cambridge Heath Road A107 and the A11 in Whitechapel.</p>\\n<h3>Cycling, walking, waterways</h3>\\n<p>The Regent's Canal runs north and west of the area with a towpath running along it next to Victoria Park, London.</p>\\n<h2>Sport and leisure</h2>\\n<p>Bethnal Green has a Non-League football club Bethnal Green United F.C., which plays at Mile End Stadium.</p>\\n<h3>Location</h3>\\n<p><br></p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>List of people from Tower Hamlets</li>\\n<li>List of schools in Tower Hamlets</li>\\n<li>Stepney Historical Trust</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>\\\"Tower Hamlets London Borough Council information about Bethnal Green\\\".

Marsh's first title came in 1978 in the lightweight division beating Edmund Gajny in the final. The following year Marsh moved up to the light welterweight division and again reached the final but was this time defeated by Eddie Copeland. In 1980, Marsh again moved up a weight, to welterweight, and again reached the final, defeating Edward Byrne. 1981 saw Marsh's final year as an amateur: this year he remained at welterweight and again reached the final, his fourth in a row. In the 67\\u00a0kg final, he defeated the future British, Commonwealth and WBO champion Chris Pyatt to win his third senior title.</p>\\n<h2>Professional career</h2>\\n\\n<p>He had his first professional fight in October 1981, defeating Andrew DaCosta on points over six rounds, in Bloomsbury, London.</p>\\n<p>In his thirteenth fight he won the vacant Southern Area Light-Welterweight Title, defeating Vernon Vanriel on points over ten rounds, at York Hall in Bethnal Green.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Terry_Marsh.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q3518909\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":1990565,\"title\":\"Murray Beauclerk, 14th Duke of St Albans\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Murray de Vere Beauclerk, 14th Duke of St Albans</b> (born 19 January 1939), styled <b>Earl of Burford</b> between 1964 and 1988, is a British peer.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Family</h2>\\n<p>St Albans is the son of Charles Beauclerk, 13th Duke of St Albans.

By profession, McGowan is a London taxi driver and occasional University speaker and arts tutor. McGowan is known internationally for his performance art including shock art, street art and installation art, and as a stuntman, internet personality, video blogger, social commentator, social critic, satirist, political activist, peace activist, and an anti-establishment, anti-war, anti-capitalist anti-monarchist and anti-power elite protester.</p>\\n<p>Under the artist name \\\"Chunky Mark\\\", McGowan entered the mainstream news in the early 2000s for his unconventional, satirical, sometimes comedic and/or ironic, and often absurd approach to public protest and demonstration. Chunky Mark conducted hundreds of performances in the UK and dozens around the world, stirring up some international attention, further debate on what \\\"art really is\\\", controversy; and both support and mockery alike from intellectuals, the art world, private corporations, the police, the military, the tabloids and the public. Often McGowan has not applied for police permission beforehand.</p>\\n<p>McGowan abandoned the Chunky Mark persona in late 2010 and fully adopted the \\\"Artist Taxi Driver\\\" persona for his web blog on YouTube, where he films himself alone in his taxi between fares, often wearing dark sunglasses, and in which he rants passionately and emotionally about the news and issues of the day. The Artist Taxi Driver's official YouTube channel (still under the \\\"ChunkyMark\\\" name) by 2013 had thousands of videos made by McGowan, with almost 30,000 subscribers, and his most popular video viewed 220,000 times.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Biography</h2>\\n<h3>Personal life</h3>\\n<p>Born in 1966 to a working class background, at the Salvation Army Mother's Hospital in Clapham, McGowan grew up in Peckham, South London, on the North Peckham Estate where he still lives. He has made some claims about his past such as he was always good at football and running and ran for his school; he has also made claims of being involved in gang culture and football hooliganism for a while in his youth and has \\\"known numerous London gangsters\\\" yet walked away from the lifestyle. McGowan is now critical of football, citing it as a \\\"distraction from the realities of being a slave\\\". McGowan has claimed that he has spent around a decade as an expatriate in Spain, where his first job was at a beach bar that was frequently visited by Mick Jones of the punk rock band The Clash. McGowan has said that despite eating animals in a number of his protests, he is in fact a staunch vegetarian in his private life, which made the animal eating protests more difficult for him. McGowan has stated that he is married with a son and a daughter but has their only inclusion in his artistry work has been off-screen in some of his more light-hearted Artist Taxi Driver videos. His son has joined him on anti-austerity marches. McGowan is critical of the British royal family, is a Republican, and claims he has never voted since \\\"all politicians are the same\\\" and the developed world has become \\\"kleptocratic\\\" rather than democratic. His political views have been described as libertarian, and/or socialist, he opposes privatization and capitalism.</p>\\n<p>McGowan was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2011 and was still receiving treatment in 2013.</p>\\n<h3>Professions</h3>\\n<p>McGowan supported himself financially through higher education in a wide variety of different jobs; as a barman, milkman, cleaner, scaffolder, builder, and Hackney carriage driver around Inner London and the Square Mile, which he often refers to as the \\\"City of Corruption\\\". The latter of these professions, a taxicab driver, he now does full-time. McGowan became a self-employed taxi driver in late 2010 after an altercation with his former taxi firm boss of eight years.</p>\\n<h3>Art, education and speaking</h3>\\n<p>Before concentrating on solo performance art, stunts and protests, McGowan was affiliated with the Young British Artists, although not officially a member of the YBAs. McGowan was heavily involved with The Children of !WOWOW! movement of visual, performance and musical artists which had a strong presence in his native Peckham and was controversial for its affiliation with rave culture. In 2003,\\u00a0!WOWOW! organized warehouse parties in Peckham which had thousands of attendees including Lauren Bush, the former US President's niece, who was accompanied by two bodyguards.</p>\\n<p>McGowan did menial work but still painted for a decade before entering the art world. One of McGowan's earliest works was at the London Art Biennale in 1998, a \\\"do-it-yourself\\\" free arts festival organized by Filipino performance artist David Medalla. In 2003, at age 33, McGowan earned a B.A. degree in Fine Art from Camberwell College of Arts, where he still occasionally lectures as a second year elective performance art tutor. McGowan also occasionally lectures to MA students at Chelsea College of Art where he is an associate, and he also occasionally speaks at Goldsmiths University of London, a public research university. McGowan has a second degree in the History of Art from the latter institution. In the past McGowan has worked with the Scottish Arts Council, the University of Central England in Birmingham, and spoken on the issues of public art and how it can relate to protest at the Royal Academy of Arts.</p>\\n<h2>\\\"Chunky Mark\\\"</h2>\\n<p>From 2001 to 2009, McGowan made dozens of unconventional street art protests and notable stunts under his \\\"Chunky Mark\\\" stage name to garner public attention to matters he cared about, or to raise attention to issues he believed were not in the wider public knowledge. They promote or bring attention to, through unconventional means, community awareness and personal responsibility. In his native country, McGowan as \\\"Chunk Mark\\\" performed hundreds of pieces of performance art, stunts and protests from 2001 to 2009. According to arts magazine <i>My Village London</i>, \\\"His witty and sometimes bizarre performance work has attracted wide media attention, and he has been featured in nationwide tabloids, <i>Art Monthly</i>, has been covered by the BBC, ITV and Channel 4.\\\" Daniel Scagnelli of <i>Arts London</i> said: \\\"McGowan could arguably be called one of the most controversial performance artists in the country and has added depth to his university\\u2019s alumni list.</p>\\n<h3>McGowan's explanation of his performance art</h3>\\n<p>When asked if he considered himself an \\\"attention seeker\\\" by <i>My London</i> of BBC News in 2003, McGowan explained his reasoning and motives behind his performance art and demonstration:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>\\\"I grew up on the infamous North Peckham Estate in south London... I turned to performance art because I found it a much more accessible medium to deliver what I was trying to express... The way to engage [poorer people in London] in art is to bring it into the street, which is what I'm doing - not by putting it in the White Cube or the National Gallery. Most people from Peckham are not going to go there - there's no-one walking around the National Gallery or the White Cube with a string vest on.\\\"</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Explaining the transition from fine art to performance art to <i>Arts London</i> in 2009, McGowan said:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>\\\"The former is not enough for what I am trying to do; that is to comment on society. I feel that the 2D image of a painting is limited, whereas today performance art can widely communicate its message to the public. My art is all about the narrative. People will watch me do my stunt and it can be sh*t, but it\\u2019s the narrative before the performance, the act itself, the aftermath and the interpretation that people are left with. That is performance art, the collective narrative and not simply the unusual act which catches people\\u2019s eye originally... I say to my students: be risky. More students are doing art than ever before and that is a good thing. Everyone should do art. Art chills you out. The more chilled out people in the world, the better the world would be. People get hung up on watching trash like <i>X Factor</i> which is destroying their brains.\\\"</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>UK protests, demonstrations and stunts</h3>\\n<p>Some of McGowan's more notable and titled protests and stunts in the United Kingdom include:</p>\\n<h4>Timeline</h4>\\n<ul><li>2001 <i>Dunce</i> - McGowan stood in the corner of the Centenary Gallery with a dunce hat on for eight hours to protest against what he believed to be the stifling of originality and creativity in the modern art world.</li>\\n<li>2002 <i>Freight 2002</i> - McGowan packed as many foreigners as he could into the House Gallery in London. It was a piece criticizing negative attitudes towards immigration, but at the same time was also a critical comment on multiculturalism.</li>\\n<li>2002 <i>Begging</i> - McGowan pretended to be a beggar outside the Centenary Gallery in London, to test people's reactions to the destitute.</li>\\n<li>2002 <i>Beat The Queen 2002</i> - At the Camberwell College of Art, London, McGowan dressed up as Queen Elizabeth II on her birthday and invited the public to bash him in her face.</li>\\n<li>2002 <i>Roll Over</i> - At Christmas 2002, McGowan rolled along the pavement from the Elephant and Castle to Gallery 1,000,000\\u00a0mph in Bethnal Green Road, a distance of four and a half miles, wearing yellow rubber marigold cleaning gloves and singing <i>We Wish You A Merry Christmas</i>. He did this in an attempt to \\\"get people to be kind and polite to cleaners for Christmas.\\\" The concept of the performance is based on Mr McGowan's experience when he was part-time cleaning and in one particular office that he cleaned he said that he never received a \\\"kind comment or a thank you\\\". McGowan explained: \\\"I never missed a day's cleaning, but even at Christmas there was no 'have a happy Christmas' written in the comment book. This performance is in response to the feelings of resentment I have towards the people of that office whose only thoughts were to criticize my cleaning.\\\" As of the stunt itself, McGowan suffered severe bruising, saying \\\"I perform better if I do not practice beforehand.\\\" He later said: \\\"It was definitely worth it and I'm feeling emotional - it's been unbelievable. Lots of artists have been called mad in the past, I'm just going join a long line of them.\\\" He also told the BBC that the inspiration for rolling came from an Indian man who rolled 2,400 miles across India and became known as the \\\"Rolling Saint.\\\"</li>\\n<li>2003 <i>Poor Little Lamb 2003</i> - Starting at Bloomberg Art Gallery, Manchester, McGowan circumnavigated the city on 1 July 2003, spending several hours pushing a dead sheep around in a pram. It was a piece about proposals to cut child benefits.</li>\\n<li>2003 <i>Monkey Nuts 2003</i> - In a protest against student debt, McGowan pushed a monkey nut along the road for several miles using only his nose to move the nut, starting at Goldsmiths College in South London and ending at Number 10 Downing Street. It took him twelve days to complete his challenge, with him covering about three-quarters of a mile every day. Upon reaching 10 Downing Street, he gave in the nut to Downing street staff, who congratulated him and offered him a cup of tea, and the police security applauded. McGowan also described his journey, saying: \\\"The streets were dirty. There was hair and spit and bird poo. There were unmentionable things.\\\" McGowan had to apply for police permission to go up the door of 10 Downing Street. Mark admitted the nut he gave in at the end was not his original - he wore out eleven others and one was stamped on by yobs. Talking to <i>The Sun</i> newspaper, McGowan said: \\\"David Blaine sitting in a plastic box is boring, what I do is much better. It was hard and lonely work... A lot of people treated me shamefully and I felt like giving up. I felt a bit like a dog down there on the pavement, on my hands and knees with people laughing and jeering. But I expect Tony Blair will have to declare the nut as a gift. It's probably worth more than my \\u00a315,000 student fees debt as a piece of contemporary art.\\\"</li>\\n<li>2003 <i>Rocket 2003</i> - McGowan famously catapulted Aida Lipscombe, 71, wearing a beaded miniskirt, in a foil-covered home-made \\\"space caspule rocket\\\" up a ramp from launch pad, through some thin wood to create a \\\"crashing\\\" effect and into a water-filled container outside Camberwell College of Arts, central London. The stunt was intended, according to McGowan, to raise attention to the plight of the pensioners who McGowan believed were being increasingly abandoned by the government, and also to highlight the attitude of the young towards the elderly. He told BBC News Online: \\\"A lot of my stuff is about the community, this one is about raising awareness of the elderly. I saw this old man being pushed over in the road and couldn't believe it, this young guy knocked him down because he was in his way... I want people to acknowledge we have as much rights as them.\\\" When planning the stunt, McGowan had received over 70 letters from pensioners expressing interest in the project and whittled down the hopefuls to seven, but decided to contact Age Concern and found out about a group of pensioners and youngsters who meet fortnightly at the Peckham Pulse Center, his own local community center. Through the Peckham community center, McGowan was introduced to Mrs Lipscombe, and it was her baseball cap and hair beads caught his eye. Just before doing the stunt, Aida told BBC News: \\\"I'm not nervous or anything - I've done much worse things in my life.\\\" She completed the stunt without any harm, as did an Asian elderly lady who \\\"wanted to meet an alien\\\", and the video of it is on McGowan's YouTube channel.</li>\\n<li>2003 \\\"Lying Down 2003\\\" for Channel 4 Television, London.</li>\\n<li>2003 <i>Welcome Doormat 2003</i> - McGowan used himself as the doormat for the Trade Apartment Gallery in October 2003. It was a protest about \\\"how 'stale' the art world has become\\\" and how \\\"up-and-coming artists and thinkers outside the box are used as doormats.\\\" McGowan said to people entering as they walked over him: \\\"We\\u2019ve noticed that the gallery is becoming quite dirty, can you please wipe your feet?\\\"</li>\\n<li>2003 <i>Chips and Beans</i> - McGowan \\\"turned himself into a full English breakfast to celebrate English culture and food\\\" for this stunt. For this stunt, McGowan sat in a bathtub for twelve days which had been set up in the shop window of the London House Gallery. The bathtub was filled with baked beans and tomato sauce, and McGowan sat in it with two chips up his nose and 7\\u00a0lb sausages wrapped around his head. Explaining the stunt to BBC News, McGowan said that the stunt came about after being visited by an Italian friend who criticized the English diet and McGowan felt he had to do something to defend it.  According to the gallery manager, Sarah McIntyre, \\\"He got so cold that his system went all funny and he was weeing in the water. The place stank.\\\"</li>\\n<li>2004 <i>Big Toe Bus Pull</i> - On 18 August 2004 in Camberwell, London, McGowan dragged a 7.5 tonne RouteMaster bus 30 meters with his big toe, making several attempts before completing the task. The bus had a driver but only for health and safety reasons. Speaking to BBC News, McGowan explained: \\\"This project was a protest against the excessive use of bus lanes and against mayor of London Ken Livingstone's ridiculous traffic strategy. It is stupid that our all ready narrow roads are being carved up, causing endless road nightmares for car drivers.\\\"</li>\\n<li>2004 <i>Autumn Leaves Protest 2004</i> - At Yesvember House on 6 November McGowan nailed his toe to the gallery wall, protesting against leaves. Explaining the stunt, McGowan told <i>Artshole</i>: \\\"I will remain with the nails in my feet for eight hours. This performance is a protest against leaves. At this time of year I am sure there are those of you who love the autumnal colors of the fallen leaves. But for some of us they are a living nightmare... Hopefully this nail driving foot protest will be recognized by the Environment Department and all deciduous trees will be banned.\\\" The nails caused significant bleeding to McGowan's feet, who was visibly in pain. After the stunt, McGowan said \\\"It didn\\u2019t hurt that much, I just nipped at the webbing. I didn\\u2019t hit the bone.\\\"</li>\\n<li>2004 <i>Artist Eats Fox 2004</i> - In public at Trinity Buoy Wharf, McGowan roasted and ate a dead fox whole, in protest at \\\"the public's fixation with a government ban on fox hunting and society's misplaced priorities.\\\" </li>\\n<li>2005 <i>On The Road To A Miracle 2005</i> - McGowan followed around an anonymous volunteer for seven miles from Camberwell to London\\u2019s Maudsley Hospital, taking a slow journey over a period of ten days. The volunteer was also a drug addict who had been denied medical help. The drug addict did this in the foetal position and only took a step after taking a kick from McGowan's Doc Martens. McGowan said he did this to symbolize what society had done to this individual who was deserving of help, and to arouse public empathy for the issue. McGowan had arranged for a doctor to offer his addict a consultation. After the stunt garnered significant local attention, the drug addict was finally allowed the medical help he sought.</li>\\n<li>2005 <i>Brighton Rocks 2005</i> - In protest of what he believed to be diminishing coastlines (and specifically gardening programs suggesting people take large builder's sacks of beach stones home) McGowan attempted to cartwheel sixty miles from Brighton Pier to Margaret Beckett\\u2019s office (the then-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), Nobel House, Smith Square, London SW1. He attempted this with two 12lb (5kg) rocks tied around each ankle and eighteen sticks of pink Brighton candy rock sellotaped across the front of his face. McGowan sustained a back injury early on but continued, finally collapsing after four days and went to consult a chiropractor. The stunt brought attention to the issue and afterwards local authorities said they may be looking at prosecuting anybody taking away large quantities of beach stones.</li>\\n<li>2005 <i>Canterbury Tale 2005</i> - McGowan crawled on his hands and knees for 60 miles, starting out at London Bridge on 26 December 2005, and finishing at Canterbury Cathedral on 6 January 2006. He did this with a rose clenched between his teeth, 18 boxes of chocolates tied around him and ankles and a triangular sign on his back saying \\\"Could You Love Me?\\\". The stunt was intended to make people consider those who are on their own at Christmas, and especially to the loneliness felt by many elderly. McGowan was greeted by Canon Ron Diss outside the Cathedral and was amazed to be allowed to crawl inside. The stunt was also covered by <i>Al Jazeera</i>, who McGowan told: \\\"Last Christmas I had two fish fingers, I was on my own. This Christmas I didn't want to be on my own, I wanted to do something about it. I was fighting crowds of cynics, exposure to the elements, and extreme fatigue. Crawling through both city and countryside was an emotional and physical battle. There have been lots of times when I wondered why I was doing it. New Year's Day was the worst day. It was quite tearful.\\\"</li>\\n<li>2006 <i>Road Rage 2006</i> - For this piece in March 2006, Chunky Mark dressed as a traffic warden and allowed members of the public in Bethnal Green, East End of London, to attack him with items he himself provided, such as rubber piping, for 8 hours. It was intended to have a \\\"therapeutic value for angry motorists.\\\"  Pictures of McGowan as the parking attendant being beaten made it onto the BBC piece <i>In pictures: 50 years of the traffic wardens.</i></li>\\n<li>2006 <i>The Mouse That Roared</i> - at Project 133, Peckham, on 20 April 2005, McGowan attempted to beat the world record for eating baked beans. It was a piece about third world hunger.</li>\\n<li>2006 <i>Reuse before Recycling</i> - McGowan was the artist-in-residence at the 2006 Knebworth Salvo Fair, the world's largest exhibition of architectural and antique salvage. <i>Reuse Before Recycling</i> was a performance intended to raise awareness of the dangers of over-recycling and the benefits of reusing. Starting at the Gherkin in Central London at 10am on Friday 16 June, McGowan rolled head over heels, carrying an old hinged door, four reclaimed house bricks, and protected by sponges. McGowan chose the Gherkin because it was the site of the old Baltic Exchange which was demolished and its materials not reused. The continuous somersaulting took McGowan over two weeks to reach his destination at Knebworth over 40 miles away. The publicity included TV especially <i>Richard and Judy</i>, radio, newspapers and magazines. Coincidentally this campaign succeeded when the EU produced its waste framework directive spearheaded by Tory MEP Caroline Jackson which enfranchised in law reuse over recycling; this is now part of UK law in the 2011 Waste Regulations.</li>\\n<li>2008 <i>Stabbed to Death 2008</i> - McGowan portrayed a corpse with a knife protruding out of him around central London, explaining it was a piece about knife crime.</li>\\n<li>2008 <i>Sandman 2008</i> - As part of the Margate Rocks art and environment festival on the Kent coastline in May 2008, McGowan conceived of this stunt to encourage people to take more British seaside holidays rather than going abroad. McGowan intended to stay buried up to the neck in sand on the beach for two days, but only managed 30 hours. </li>\\n<li>2009 <i>Mad Susan Boyle</i> was a critical comment on celebrity culture, reality television and Simon Cowell; after the alleged mental breakdown of singer Susan Boyle due to the pressures of fame towards the end of <i>Britain's Got Talent</i> Boyle was admitted to The Priory the day after the show ended. <i>Mad Susan Boyle</i> was performed live on London's Resonance FM with Simon Ould and the press in the studio; McGowan wore a straitjacket and a box over his head with a picture of Mrs Boyle, and acted erratically.</li>\\n<li>2009 <i>Burn Gordon Brown 2009</i> - McGowan burned an effigy of Gordon Brown outside the Guy Hilton Gallery, London. It was a protest against the then-Prime Minister's staying on in his position after the Parliamentary expenses scandal and also Brown's poor handling of the economic recession.</li>\\n<li>2010 <i>Sorry Performance 2010</i> - For this performance on 21 February 2010, Chunky Mark crawled on his hands and knees with a cardboard sign which read \\\"SORRY\\\" through the streets of Royal Wootton Bassett. It is a town known for its military funeral repatriations of British soldiers killed in action, often organized by The Royal British Legion. <i>Sorry Performance 2010</i> caused some attention among the townspeople but avoided any significant controversy since the streets were mostly empty of officials at the time. He said: \\\"This performance/art event is an attempt to say sorry for all the civilians that have been and that are being killed due to this country\\u2019s foreign policy.\\\"</li>\\n<li>2010 <i>The Impossibility of Art in the Mind of a Fucking Moron</i> - This was a protest against the UK Coalition Government from April through May 2010 in which McGowan put up a large photograph of David Cameron outside 10 Downing Street during the 2010 UK election, and prostrated himself in front of it 10,000 times.</li>\\n<li>2011 <i>24 Hour Olympic Statue</i> - Hackney Wick Gallery, London, a critique of the 2012 London Olympics.</li>\\n</ul><h4>Where's Daddy's Pig?</h4>\\n<p>In April 2013 McGowan launched a new piece of performance art protest entitled <i>Where's Daddy's Pig</i> in which he would give a letter written by him and his two children to David Cameron. On 24 April 2013 he pushed a \\\"daddy Cameron pig\\\" oinking pig toy on wheels along the pavement with his nose from Kings College Hospital (where his cancer had been diagnosed) to 10 Downing Street and the Bank of England.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/ArtistTaxiDriver.gif\",\"wikidata\":\"Q5981811\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":5929225,\"title\":\"Enzo Maccarinelli\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Enzo Maccarinelli</b> (born 20 August 1980) is a Welsh professional boxer who has fought at Cruiserweight and Light Heavyweight. He is a former World Boxing Organization (WBO) cruiserweight title holder and also held the European title at that weight limit. He is the current Commonwealth Light Heavyweight Champion and is promoted by Frank Warren.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early career</h2>\\n<p>On 12 May 2000, Maccarinelli suffered his first defeat at the hands of southpaw Lee Swaby. Swaby, from Lincoln, England, sent Maccarinelli down with a crushing right hand, knocking Maccarinelli down in the third round. Maccarinelli never took the rematch against Swaby.</p>\\n<p>On 28 June 2003, Maccarinelli, known as \\\"the Big Mac\\\" won the vacant WBU cruiserweight title when he defeated Bruce Scott by fourth-round TKO. He made seven successful defences of his WBU title before vacating.</p>\\n<p>On 8 July 2006, Maccarinelli fought against former World Boxing Council (WBC) cruiserweight champion Marcelo Fabian Dom\\u00ednguez for the WBO interim cruiserweight title. Maccarinelli won the title with a ninth-round TKO. The natural progression was a title fight against the then WBO title holder, Johnny Nelson. Due to several injuries to Nelson this matchup never transpired, and On 22 September 2006 he announced his retirement, automatically relinquishing the belt and allowing Maccarinelli to be promoted to full champion status.</p>\\n<p>On 14 October 2006 Maccarinelli made his first defence of the WBO title, stopping former opponent Mark Hobson in the first round in a fight that was widely expected to last the distance. This was followed by another first round win over Bobby Gunn on 7 April 2007 at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. The Gunn fight was stopped with just\\u00a0:25 seconds remaining in the first round by referee Mark Nelson, even though Gunn was not down and only had a small cut. It was widely and erroneously reported that Maccarinelli had broken Bobby Gunn's nose, but it was a small cut to the bridge of the nose that caused the bleeding. Gunn's nose was not broken and most observers at ringside thought the fight was stopped prematurely.</p>\\n<p>On 21 July 2007 Maccarinelli defended his WBO cruiserweight championship against former WBC champ Wayne Braithwaite and won by unanimous decision, after dominating the match. On 3 November 2007 Maccarinelli successfully defended his WBO cruiserweight title against Mohamed Azzaoui winning by TKO in the 4th Round.</p>\\n<p>In July 2012, Maccarinelli was banned for six months after testing positive for Methylhexaneamine.</p>\\n<h2>'Bombs Away' and loss of title</h2>\\n<p>Maccarinelli's next fight was an all-British unification fight against the WBA/WBC champion David Haye. The fight took place on 8 March 2008 at the O2 Arena, London and was much hyped in the weeks running up to the event, being given the tagline \\\"bombs away\\\" (referring to the high KO percentages and punching power both men boasted). Maccarinelli lost the fight and his WBO belt when he was knocked out in the 2nd round. A right hand by Haye knocked Maccarinelli down towards the end of the round and although he was able to get back up it was on unsteady legs and the referee stepped in to stop the fight.</p>\\n<p>After the fight Haye announced that he would be moving up to the heavyweight division with immediate effect and would therefore be vacating his newly won belts. Because of this Maccarinelli received an immediate opportunity to reclaim his WBO belt in a matchup against undefeated American Jonathon Banks for the now vacant championship, but due to injury Banks was forced to pull out. After several replacements were unable to fight, Maccarinelli instead stepped up to heavyweight to face Matthew Ellis. Maccarinelli won after a 2nd round KO in what was his debut at the higher weight. After the fight Frank Warren announced that Maccarinelli would face Banks in a re-scheduled bout for the WBO belt during February 2009.</p>\\n<p>Once again the Banks fight proved to be a non starter (Banks opted to make an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to win the IBF cruiserweight title against Tomasz Adamek) and instead Maccarinelli's next fight was against the American based Londoner Ola Afolabi for the \\\"interim\\\" WBO title. The fight took place on March 14 at the M.E.N. Arena in Manchester, on the undercard of the Amir Khan vs Marco Antonio Barrera bout. Maccarinelli was favoured by most observers to win, however things did not go as expected as Maccarinelli struggled in the early rounds and was staggered in the 3rd round by a short chopping right hand from the slick Afolabi. Despite managing to recover and win the majority of the next few rounds he was knocked out by Afolabi in round 9 when a huge overhand right put him on the canvas and forced the referee to call off the fight.</p>\\n<h2>Lebedev fight, \\\"retirement\\\" and return</h2>\\n\\n<p>Maccarinelli's next fight was against the unbeaten Russian Denis Lebedev on 18 July 2009. As with the Afolabi contest the fight took place at the M.E.N. Arena on the undercard of an Amir Khan fight, this time Khan's WBA light-welterweight title challenge against Andreas Kotelnik. From the very beginning of the fight Maccarinelli struggled with the power of his opponent and by the end of the second round his right eye had swollen completely shut from the punches landed by Lebedev. In the third round Lebedev rocked Maccarinelli with an uppercut which landed cleanly through his guard and after a further barrage of unanswered punches the referee stepped in and called a stop to the fight.</p>\\n<p>Before the fight Maccarinelli had admitted that the contest represented \\\"the last chance saloon\\\" in terms of getting his career back on track, following 2 KO losses in his last 3 fights, and talking immediately after the defeat he hinted that this latest setback could signal the end of his boxing career. In an interview with his local paper a few days later Maccarinelli apparently confirmed his intention to retire from the sport, although he retracted this in a later interview with the same source.</p>\\n<p>Maccarinelli began his latest comeback attempt on another Amir Khan undercard, this time Khan's WBA Light-Welterweight title defence against on December 5 at the Metro Radio Arena in Newcastle. His opponent was the relatively unknown Hungarian journeyman Krisztian Jaksi. who provided little resistance and was knocked out in the 1st round. Maccarinelli managed a second consecutive 1st round KO victory against Hungarian opposition when he defeated Zoltan Czekus at the Echo Arena Liverpool on 13 March 2010.</p>\\n<h2>EBU title shot</h2>\\n<p>Following his two quick comeback wins Maccarinelli's next fight took place on 27 April 2010 when he fought Russian prospect Alexander Kotlobay in St Petersburg for the vacant European cruiserweight title. Despite now being the fighter that had to travel and fight on someone else's patch, Maccarinelli scored his third consecutive quick victory when he knocked Kotlobay down with an overhand right before the referee stepped in to end the fight at 2:15 of the first round.</p>\\n<p>His first defence of his newly won title came as part of Frank Warren's \\\"Magnificent Seven\\\" fight card, which took place on 18 September 2010 at the LG Arena in Birmingham. His opponent for this defence was the undefeated Ukrainian prospect Alexander Frenkel. Despite a tentative opening round Maccarinelli improved and managed to rock his opponent in the fourth round with a right hand. A clash of heads in the sixth led to a cut developing over his right eye, however the fight still appeared to be going Maccarinelli's way until he was knocked down heavily towards the end of round seven by a left hook from Frenkel. Despite managing to rise by the count of nine he was extremely unsteady and appeared to be in no position to defend himself. However the referee allowed the bout to continue, only for it to be stopped a few seconds later when a three punch combination from Frenkel led to a second knockdown. The final blows were struck with such ferocity that Maccarinelli was knocked unconscious and required oxygen and medical attention before being able to leave the ring. At the time of the fight there was heavy criticism from both journalists and fellow boxers at the decision by the referee to allow the fight to continue after the first knockdown, when it was clear that Maccarinelli was in no position to defend himself.</p>\\n<p>As with the aftermath of the Afolabi and Lebedev defeats there were also been calls for Maccarinelli to retire from the ring, something which the boxer himself admitted to the press was a distinct possibility following his fourth KO loss in eight fights.</p>\\n<h2>Move to Light Heavyweight</h2>\\n<p>After a period of inactivity following the Frenkel defeat, in February 2011 Maccarinelli announced that rather than retiring he would instead be dropping down in weight to compete in the 175\\u00a0lb Light Heavyweight division, with a view to having his first fight at the weight limit later on in the year.</p>\\n<p>Several months later he made the further announcement that he would once again be working with former coach Enzo Calzaghe, who was part of Maccarinelli's team during his successful run at cruiserweight. At the same time he also expressed a desire to fight for a world title at the new weight limit in the future, and in particular put forward the idea of an all Welsh title fight between himself and current WBO belt holder Nathan Cleverly.</p>\\n<p>Exactly 14 months after his last in-ring appearance Maccarinelli's first fight at the new weight limit took place at the York Hall in Bethnal Green on November 18, 2011. As with 2 of his previous 4 fights at cruiserweight the opponent was a Hungarian fighter, this time the undefeated (and relatively unknown) Gyorgy Marosi. Maccarinelli emerged victorious, scoring a 1st round TKO victory after just 91 seconds against an overmatched Marosi.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Enzo_Maccarinelli.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q928194\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":6789330,\"title\":\"Peter Coles\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Peter Coles</b> is a theoretical cosmologist and head of the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the University of Sussex, a post he took up in February 2013.</p>\\n<p>He was born in Newcastle upon Tyne and educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle.

After she had already given birth to two children by him Wedderburn sold Robert's mother Rosanna, then five months pregnant with his third child, back to her previous owner. (James Wedderburn later returned to live in Britain. His legitimate son and heir, defending his father after these details were made public in the British press, denied the paternity and further claimed Rosanna was both promiscuous and unable to control her temper.) James Wedderburn stipulated, however, that Rosanna's child (Robert) when born should be legally free, and himself officially registered both Robert and an elder brother, James, as free. Although born free, Wedderburn was raised in a harsh environment, as his mother was often flogged due to her \\\"violent and rebellious temper\\\". She was eventually re-sold away from her son, who was then raised by his maternal grandmother, a woman known as \\\"Talkee Amy\\\".</p>\\n<p>To escape the insecurity and abuse of the plantation, Wedderburn signed on with the Royal Navy at the age of 16. On the ships, food and living conditions were horrific, and it was during this time that Wedderburn became increasingly aghast at the violent punishments used by the British both on their ships and in their colonies. He arrived in Britain at age 17 and lived in the district of St. Giles, London among a community of runaway slaves, Jamaican ex-servicemen, and other immigrant minorities including Jews, Lascars and Irish. Known as the \\\"London blackbirds\\\", this ethnically diverse subculture is reported to have been free of the racial discrimination so prevalent elsewhere in this era. However, as people living on the margins, the \\\"blackbirds\\\" often relied on criminal activity in order to survive.</p>\\n<p>Through means that remain unclear (it is possible that he had been an apprentice in Jamaica or had learned while in the Navy), Wedderburn became a journeyman tailor. As he referred to himself as a \\\"flint\\\" tailor, this suggests he was registered in the book of trades and shared values typical of other artisans - including pride in his craft and a belief in economic independence. Unfortunately, the instability of his career made him increasingly susceptible to the effects of a trade recession, inflation and food shortages, and he was soon reduced to part-time mending work on the outskirts of town. By now married and desperate for money during one of his wife's pregnancies, Wedderburn visited his father's family at Inveresk on the outskirts of Edinburgh. As this proved unsuccessful (apparently his father disavowed him and he was sent away with some small beer and a bent or broken sixpence), Wedderburn dabbled in petty theft and keeping a bawdy house. At some point he published in Bell's Life in London an account of his origin and his father's failure to provide for him. His alleged half-brother Andrew Colvile published a reply citing his father's denial of paternity and later threatened to sue the paper if it published any further slanders.</p>\\n<h2>Religious conversion and activity</h2>\\n<p>In 1786, Wedderburn stopped to listen to a Wesleyan preacher he heard in Seven Dials. Influenced by a mixture of Arminian, millenarian, Calvinist, and Unitarian ideas, he converted to be a Methodist, and soon published a small theological tract called <i>Truth Self Supported: or, a Refutation of Certain Doctrinal Errors Generally Adopted in the Christian Church</i>. Although this work contained no explicit mention of slavery, it does suggest Wedderburn's future path in subversive and radical political action.</p>\\n<p>Politically influenced by Thomas Spence, Wedderburn published an anti-slavery book entitled <i>The Horrors of Slavery</i> in 1824, printed by William Dugdale and possibly coauthored by George Cannon.</p>\\n<p>To promote his religious message, he opened his own Unitarian chapel in Hopkins Street in Soho in London. After he began to question Christian tenets he was later associated with Deism. He also campaigned for freedom of speech.</p>\\n<p>Wedderburn served several prison terms. According to Linebaugh (2000) it is recorded that Wedderburn \\\"did time in Cold Bath Fields, Dorchester, and Giltspur Street Compter prisons for theft, blasphemy, and keeping a bawdy house.\\\" While imprisoned, Wedderburn wrote a letter to Francis Place.</p>\\n<p>In 1831, at the age of 68, he was arrested and sent to Giltspur Street Prison and sentenced to two years in jail, having been convicted of keeping a brothel. On his release he appears to have gone to New York, where a newspaper records his involvement in a fraud case and refers to him as a \\\"a tailor and breeches maker, field preacher, anti-bank deposite politician, romance writer, circulating librarian, and ambulating dealer in drugs, deism, and demoralization in general\\\". He returned to London shortly after. His last mention in the historical record was in March 1834 when a Home Office informer listed him as present among the congregation at the Theobald's Road Institute.</p>\\n<h2>Death</h2>\\n<p>The exact year of his death is unknown, although it appears to have been before official registers of death began to be kept in 1837. He may be the \\\"Robert Wedderborn\\\" who died aged 72 in Bethnal Green and was buried in a non-conformist ceremony on 4 January 1835.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Robert_Wedderburn.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q7350926\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":2688767,\"title\":\"Henry Akinwande\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Henry Akinwande</b> (born 12 October 1965) is a retired English professional heavyweight boxer and former WBO heavyweight champion.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q1260458\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":0},{\"pageid\":6871369,\"title\":\"Kevin Mitchell (boxer)\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Kevin Martin Mitchell</b> (born 29 October 1984) is a British professional boxer based in Dagenham, London, England.

He began his political career as a member of the Labour Party, before joining the National Front (NF), in which he held a number of positions during Tyndall's chairmanship of the party. In the October 1974 general election he was NF candidate at Deptford, polling 1731 votes (4.5%). At this time, he was a mathematics teacher at Tulse Hill Comprehensive, a school which contained many black pupils. His election address said, \\\"To young immigrants, Richard Edmonds says that they should study to the best of their abilities, for their duty and future lie in helping their compatriots to build up their own countries\\\".</p>\\n<p>He followed Tyndall into the New National Front in 1980 and was appointed head of the youth section, editing <i>Young Nationalist</i> magazine.</p>\\n<p>From 1982 onwards, Edmonds continued to hold influential positions within the newly formed British National Party, rising to deputy leader and also acting leader for a spell in 1986 whilst Tyndall was serving a prison sentence for incitement to racial hatred. He also took a role in funding the party, notably in 1989 when he provided some of the money for the purchase of a new party headquarters/bookshop in Welling. Edmonds ran the party's Welling premises, living over the shop, for ten years, from 1989 to 1999. Edmonds' leading role in the party was further strengthened by his result in the 1992 election when his 3.6% share of the vote in Bethnal Green and Stepney represented the party's best showing in that election.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q7325446\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":363871,\"title\":\"Pete Doherty\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Peter \\\"Pete\\\" Doherty</b> (born 12 March 1979) is an English musician, writer, actor, poet and artist. He is best known musically for being co-frontman of The Libertines, which he formed with Carl Bar\\u00e2t in 1997. His other musical project is indie band Babyshambles. In 2005, Doherty became prominent in tabloids, the news media, and pop culture blogs because of his romantic relationship with model Kate Moss and his frequently-publicised drug addictions.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life</h2>\\n<p>Doherty was born in Hexham, Northumberland to mother Jacqueline (n\\u00e9e Michels), a nurse and lance corporal, and a Catholic father, Peter John Doherty, a major in the British Army. His paternal grandfather was Irish, from Cheekpoint, County Waterford; his maternal grandfather was Jewish (the son of immigrants from France and Russia) and his maternal grandmother was of English descent. He was raised Catholic. He grew up at a number of army garrisons, due to his father's work, living at various times at garrisons in Catterick, Belfast, Wildenrath Barracks in the north west of Germany, Bedworth, Dorset, and Larnaca, along with his mother and two sisters, Amy Jo and Emily. Doherty was the second of the three children. It was while in Dorset, at the age of 11, that Doherty was first inspired to play guitar. He started playing in order to impress classmate Emily Baker whom he fancied. 18 years later they were reunited where the now Brighton based singer/songwriter won his support slot. He achieved 11 GCSEs, 7 of which were A* grades, at Nicholas Chamberlaine Comprehensive School in Bedworth and four passes at A Level, two at grade A. At the age of 16, he won a poetry competition and embarked on a tour of Russia organised by the British Council.</p>\\n<p>After his A-levels, he moved to his grandmother's flat in London \\u2013 where he said he felt 'destined' to be \\u2013 and got a job filling graves in Willesden Cemetery, although most of his time was spent reading and writing while sitting on gravestones. In a clip later made famous by YouTube, an eighteen-year old Doherty can be seen in an interview with MTV, on the day of the release of Oasis' <i>Be Here Now</i> album. He attended Queen Mary, a college of the University of London, to study English literature, but left the course after his first year. After leaving university, he moved into a London flat with friend and fellow musician Carl Bar\\u00e2t, who had been a classmate of Doherty's older sister at Brunel University.</p>\\n<h2>Career</h2>\\n<h3>The Libertines</h3>\\n\\n<p>Doherty and Bar\\u00e2t formed a band called The Libertines in the late '90s, although it was not until 2002, with the release of their debut album <i>Up the Bracket</i>, that they began to achieve widespread mainstream success.</p>\\n<p>The group achieved critical and commercial success and gained a dedicated cult following, with Doherty in particular being praised by fans and critics alike as one of the most promising songwriters to emerge on the British music scene for some time. However, Doherty's increasing drug problems led to his estrangement from the band. In 2003, he was jailed for burgling Bar\\u00e2t's flat. The two initially fell out over this incident, but made amends whilst Doherty was in prison. He was originally sentenced to 6 months, but his sentence was cut to 2 months. Upon his release, Doherty immediately reunited with Bar\\u00e2t and the rest of the band to play a gig in the Tap 'n' Tin pub in Chatham, Kent.</p>\\n<p>Following his rejoining of the band, Doherty sought treatment for his drug addiction. He attended the alternative detox centre Wat Tham Krabok, a temple in Thailand, famous for its rehabilitation program for crack and heroin users. He left after three days and returned to England. As a consequence of this, The Libertines cancelled appearances that they were due to make at the Isle of Wight and Glastonbury festivals.</p>\\n<p>However, while post-production work was taking place on the second Libertines album in June 2004, Doherty was again asked to leave the band. The band cited Doherty's continuing drug addiction as the reason for his dismissal, but emphasised their willingness to take him back once he had addressed his addiction. Although Bar\\u00e2t had previously stated that the Libertines were merely on hiatus, pending Doherty's recovery, the group effectively disbanded with Doherty's departure at the end of 2004. The remaining members became involved in other projects (see Yeti and Dirty Pretty Things). On 12 April 2007, Pete Doherty and Carl Bar\\u00e2t played 13 songs together at the second of Doherty's \\\"An Evening with Pete Doherty\\\" gigs at the Hackney Empire, London.</p>\\n<p>In 2010 The Libertines reformed for appearances at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. They performed on 27 August at Leeds Festival and on 28 August at Reading Festival. The festival appearances were preluded by two gigs at the HMV Forum on 24 and 25 August.</p>\\n<h3>Collaborations</h3>\\n<p>Prior to the disbanding of The Libertines, Doherty collaborated with local poet Wolfman. Together they recorded the single \\\"For Lovers\\\", which entered the top 10, charting at number 7, in April 2004. Despite the success of the single, which was nominated for a prestigious <i>Ivor Novello Award</i> for songwriting, Doherty and Wolfman received relatively little money, having already sold the publishing rights for a small sum in a pub.</p>\\n<p>Later in 2004, Doherty provided guest vocals to the song \\\"Down to the Underground\\\" by the British group Client. The song was released in June 2004 as a B-side to the group's single \\\"In It for the Money\\\" and appears on their second album <i>City</i>.</p>\\n<p>In 2005 Doherty collaborated with the British rock band Littl'ans on the single \\\"Their Way\\\".</p>\\n<p>In 2006, Doherty was featured on the charity single \\\"Janie Jones\\\", which was released to raise funds for Strummerville. A number of artists and bands, such as Dirty Pretty Things, We Are Scientists, The Kooks and The Holloways, also featured on the track.</p>\\n<p>In August 2006 it was announced that Doherty was recording with The Streets frontman Mike Skinner on a new version of \\\"Prangin' Out\\\", from Skinner's album <i>The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living</i>.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Babyshambles</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>Doherty founded Babyshambles towards the end of his time with The Libertines. The group has released two studio albums, <i>Down in Albion</i>, in November 2005 and <i>Shotter's Nation</i> in October 2007. The band's touring schedule and releases have occasionally been disrupted by Doherty's ongoing legal problems. The line-up of the band has changed several times: drummer Gemma Clarke left the band due to Doherty's drug problems and was replaced by Adam Ficek, and guitarist and co-songwriter Patrick Walden has also left the band and was replaced by Mick Whitnall. In August 2006, Babyshambles signed up with major record label Parlophone, on which they released <i>The Blinding EP</i> on 9 December 2006. In January 2007, they signed a long term record deal with Parlophone.</p>\\n<p>In November 2007 Babyshambles played their first arena tour, taking in dates at the MEN Arena in Manchester, the Nottingham Arena, Bournemouth International Centre, London's Wembley Arena and Birmingham's National Indoor Arena.</p>\\n<p>In September 2013, the band's third album <i>Sequel to the Prequel</i> was released.</p>\\n<h3>Solo work and guerrilla gigs</h3>\\n<p>Doherty has been working on new acoustic material, similar to the wealth of his unreleased songs that can already be downloaded on the internet. On his own, and often with his band, he has continued The Libertines' tradition of performing on short notice guerrilla gigs in small venues. On New Year's Eve 2005, Doherty held a guerrilla gig in his North London flat where he showcased some of his solo works, many of which later leaked onto the internet. 31 March and 1 April 2006 Doherty was performing two surprising solo gigs, his first in mainland Europe, at the NonStop Kino pornographic cinema and venue in Graz, Austria, after he failed to turn up for an earlier arrangement in January. For this occasion he produced, at the suggestion of Bettina Aichbauer, friend of Doherty and owner of the NonStop Kino, a film with the title <i>Spew It Out Your Soul</i> which he showed on screen during his performance. On 12 July 2008, Doherty played a solo gig at the Royal Albert Hall. It was his biggest solo show so far. The concert was originally scheduled for 26 April, but had to be rescheduled to a later date due to Doherty being sentenced to 14 weeks in prison for breaching probation on 8 April. The solo show did not get the best ratings but was all in all still well received. Jon Swaine of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> criticised that \\\"whole chunks of the set \\u2026 passed by as listless noodling, with neither Doherty nor the audience appearing to know quite how to behave\\\" and that \\u2013 without a full band \\u2013 Doherty seemed out of place at such a big venue. Betty Clarke of <i>The Guardian</i> described Doherty as \\\"focused\\\" and \\\"on good form\\\". Friend and collaborator Peter Wolfe had a guest appearance on stage when Doherty performed \\\"For Lovers\\\". Swaine stated Wolfe ruined the song with \\\"some especially tuneless backing vocals\\\". The gig was forced to an abrupt end during the encore due to a stage invasion by the fans.</p>\\n<p>On 13 January 2009, NME.COM announced that Doherty's solo album, entitled <i>Grace/Wastelands</i> would be released on 16 March, preceded by a single, \\\"Last of the English Roses\\\", on 9 March. The website also revealed the tracklisting of the album and credits. In 2009 Doherty was made an honorary patron of the University Philosophical Society.</p>\\n<p>Whilst performing a solo gig at the Grimsby Auditorium in March 2009, Doherty declared Grimsby a \\\"shit-hole\\\" mid-way through his set after being continuously pelted with coins and drinks by a harsh crowd.</p>\\n<h3>Painting and writing</h3>\\n<p>In June 2006, Doherty announced that he had signed a deal with Orion Books to publish his journals, in which he had recorded poetry, drawings, and photos over the course of his career. Most of Doherty's journals are freely available on the internet. The book, titled <i>The Books of Albion: The Collected Writings of Peter Doherty</i>, was released on 21 June 2007.</p>\\n<p>On 15 May 2007, Doherty exhibited his paintings for the first time. The art exhibition took place at the London's Bankrobber Gallery, and was on show for one month. The collection featured 14 paintings.</p>\\n<p>An exhibition of Doherty's paintings titled, \\\"Art of the Albion\\\", took place at the Gallerie Chappe in Paris from 25 April to 25 May 2008. The exhibit caused controversy due to artworks made with Doherty's own blood. According to newspapers, anti-drug campaigners were enraged and accused Doherty of glamourising illegal substance abuse. Art experts were similarly unimpressed. David West, the owner of London's Decima gallery, for example, slammed his work: \\\"It's not got any artistic merit. He's using his blood to make them interesting, but when you look at them they're what any four-year-old can do.\\\"</p>\\n<h3>Modelling</h3>\\n<p>Following in the footsteps of model and ex-fianc\\u00e9e Kate Moss, Doherty became the face of Roberto Cavalli's Fall 2007/2008 fashion advertising campaign. The photos gained praise for depicting a much cleaner and more handsome Doherty. The '50s-style photographs have also been compared to images of Marlon Brando.</p>\\n<h3>Acting</h3>\\n<p>On 9 December 2010 it was reported that Doherty would be taking the lead role opposite Charlotte Gainsbourg in <i>Confession of a Child of the Century</i>, Sylvie Verheyde's film adaption of Alfred de Musset's autobiographical novel <i>La Confession d'un Enfant du Si\\u00e8cle</i>. The film was screened at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.</p>\\n<h2>Influences</h2>\\n<p>In interviews, Doherty has listed his favourite books as George Orwell's <i>1984</i>, <i>Brighton Rock</i> by Graham Greene, <i>Our Lady of the Flowers</i> by Jean Genet, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> by Charles Baudelaire and the complete works of Oscar Wilde. He has also mentioned Emily Dickinson and Tony Hancock as influences; Doherty and his father were once members of the Tony Hancock Appreciation Society. Doherty mentions Hancock, and makes an allusion to his famous phrase 'Stone me!', in an early song entitled \\\"You're My Waterloo\\\". However, numerous literary and musical allusions occur throughout Doherty's ongoing <i>Books of Albion</i>. He places particular importance on the Romantic poets and on existential philosophers such as Albert Camus and Miguel de Unamuno. Doherty has also alluded to work by the Marquis de Sade and Thomas de Quincey. On the Babyshambles album <i>Down in Albion</i>, there is a track entitled \\\"\\u00c0 rebours\\\", which is significantly influenced by the novel of the same name by Joris-Karl Huysmans.</p>\\n<p>Doherty has supported up-and-coming British bands, such as indie bands The Paddingtons and The View.</p>\\n<p>Doherty is also known to be a devoted follower of Queens Park Rangers football club. As a youth he wrote a fanzine, entitled \\\"All Quiet on the Western Avenue\\\".</p>\\n<p>A frequent lyrical theme for Doherty is Albion, the ancient name for Great Britain. Doherty also uses 'Albion' as the name of a ship sailing to a utopia called Arcadia, a place without rules or authority. Doherty and Bar\\u00e2t shared a flat in London, at 112a Teesdale Street, Bethnal Green, affectionately known as 'The Albion Rooms', despite being rather run down. Doherty named his diaries, in which he writes poems and other thoughts, the <i>Books of Albion</i>.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Pete_doherty_2007.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q311875\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":322138,\"title\":\"Peter Green (musician)\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Peter Green</b> (born <b>Peter Allen Greenbaum</b>, 29 October 1946) is a British blues rock guitarist and the founder of the band Fleetwood Mac.

He is a nine-time world champion, having held the NWA world title once, the IWGP title four times, AJPW's Triple Crown three times and Wrestle-1's World title one time. He also has held a dozen World Tag Team Championships in the U.S. and Japan. Between NJPW, AJPW, and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Mutoh has held 22 total championships.</p>\\n<p>He is also famous for taking part in what is generally considered to be the bloodiest professional wrestling match of all time against Hiroshi Hase, leading to the creation of the \\\"Muta Scale\\\".</p>\\n<p>Mutoh is currently the owner/founder of Wrestle-1 (W-1), where he also wrestles semi-regularly, and makes occasional special appearances for American promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as part of a TNA/W-1 talent exchange partnership. He is also currently the Wrestle-1 Champion in his first reign, making him the only wrestler to be World Champion in NJPW, AJPW, and W-1.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Career</h2>\\n<h3>Early career (1984\\u20131987)</h3>\\n<p>Mutoh was an amateur wrestler and competed in numerous Judo competitions prior to being trained by Hiro Matsuda in the New Japan Pro Wrestling Academy. He debuted on October 5, 1984 against Masahiro Chono. In 1986, Mutoh was sent on his first learning excursion to the United States for seasoning. Muta wrestled in Florida as the White Ninja and teaming with Kendo Nagasaki, before returning to New Japan in 1986, when he was nicknamed \\\"Space Lone Wolf\\\", a space-age type character that was briefly revived in 2005 by NOSAWA Rongai. In March 1987, Mutoh won the IWGP Tag Team Championship with Shiro Koshinaka, before losing the titles to Akira Maeda and Nobuhiko Takada six days later. In the summer of 1987, Mutoh took part in the NOW vs. NEW feud, in which he aligned himself with Antonio Inoki and his group, teaming with the likes of Inoki, Seiji Sakaguchi, Yoshiaki Fujiwara, and Kantaro Hoshino, battling the likes of Tatsumi Fujinami, Riki Choshu, Maeda, Kengo Kimura, and Super Strong Machine.</p>\\n<h3>World Wrestling Council and World Class Championship Wrestling (1988\\u20131989)</h3>\\n<p>In January 1988, Mutoh went on another excursion, this time in Puerto Rico for the World Wrestling Council under his new ring name, The Super Black Ninja. He feuded with Miguel Perez, Jr., with whom he lost a hair vs. hair match to that April. It was in Puerto Rico he formed The Three Musketeers with Chono and Shinya Hashimoto. He wrestled only one match in New Japan on July 29, before returning to Puerto Rico. In the fall of 1988, Mutoh moved to the Dallas, Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling, where he reunited with Kendo Nagasaki and had a very short lived feud with Kevin Von Erich before departing the organization in March 1989. Mutoh's personality and ring skills earned him a high billing in the National Wrestling Alliance, where he was dubbed <b>The Great Muta</b>.</p>\\n<h3>National Wrestling Alliance (1989\\u20131990)</h3>\\n<p>Muta first appeared, as Great Mota, in the NWA on the March 18, 1989 edition of World Championship Wrestling. His manager Gary Hart introduced him as the son of the Great Kabuki, whom Gary Hart also had managed years earlier. He wrestled his first match under the new persona on April 2 against Scott Casey. Muta would feud with stars like Lex Luger, Ric Flair, and especially Sting, from whom he would capture the NWA World Television Championship on September 3, 1989. He eventually lost the championship to Arn Anderson on January 2, 1990 (aired on the January 12, 1990 edition of NWA Power Hour), and some time after the Clash of the Champions on February 6, Mutoh eventually returned to New Japan, going between his real name and his Muta gimmick as he pleased.</p>\\n<h3>New Japan Pro Wrestling (1990\\u20132009, 2012, 2013, 2014)</h3>\\n<p>Mutoh quickly rose in rank since returning to New Japan in March 1990. He would debut his Great Muta persona six months later. In April 1990, he won his second IWGP Tag Team title with Masahiro Chono, defeating Shinya Hashimoto and Masa Saito. He and Chono would hold the titles for over six months, before finally losing them to Hiroshi Hase and Kensuke Sasaki. In 1991, Mutoh and Chono, along with Hashimoto, cemented their status as the next generation of New Japan, surpassing Antonio Inoki, Tatsumi Fujinami, and Riki Ch\\u014dsh\\u016b, after the finals of the first G1 Climax tournament. In an epic thirty-minute match, Mutoh was bested by Chono and, together with Hashimoto, the three celebrated in the ring, then afterwards they were labeled the <i>Three Musketeers</i> of New Japan Pro Wrestling.</p>\\n<p>1992 saw Chono repeat his success in the G1 Climax (winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the process); just four days later, Mutoh, donning his Muta persona, beat Japanese legend Riki Ch\\u014dsh\\u016b for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, marking his first reign. On December 14, Muta faced Hiroshi Hase in a famous match where Hase used a foreign object to beat at Muta's forehead, as payback for their previous encounters, including the September 14, 1990 encounter, in which Muta busted Hase open. Muta bladed and cut very deeply into his forehead. As a result of this, Muta bled profusely for the rest of the match, and to this day he still bears scars from where he sliced.</p>\\n<p>For a short time in 1993, after beating Chono in a title versus title match at Fantastic Story in Tokyo Dome (known in North America as WCW/New Japan Supershow III), Mutoh held both the NWA and IWGP championships at the same time (being one of only two men ever to do so along with Tatsumi Fujinami); the unification was short-lived, as Barry Windham beat him a month later for the NWA World title at SuperBrawl III. As IWGP champion, Mutoh had a variety of challengers in title matches and exhibitions, including Hulk Hogan, Sting, The Great Kabuki, and his fellow members of the Three Musketeers, Chono and Hashimoto, before finally losing the title on September 20, 1993 to Hashimoto. Following this title loss and a match with Hogan against the Hellraisers (the team of Hawk Warrior and Kensuke Sasaki as Power Warrior), Mutoh returned to fighting primarily under his real name, reviving the Muta name for certain matches, such as a special match with Antonio during his retirement countdown. During this time, Mutoh created a team with Hiroshi Hase, working their way up the ranks against the likes of the Steiner Brothers to challenge the Hellraisers in November 1994 and capturing the IWGP Tag Team championship\\u2014his third tag title.</p>\\n<p>On April 17th, 1994 Mutoh returned to WCW to face Stunning Steve Austin at Spring Stampede for the U.S. Championship.</p>\\n<p>While having the Tag Team title around his waist was fine, Mutoh had further ambitions: beating the man who took his title, Shinya Hashimoto; by now the IWGP champion for nearly a year. His second title reign came on May 3, 1995\\u2014a year and two days after Hashimoto won the championship from Fujinami. After winning the IWGP title, Mutoh and Hase vacated the Tag Team titles so Mutoh could focus on his Heavyweight title. Afterwards, Mutoh went on to win the 1995 G1 Climax, beating Hashimoto in the finals to become the first of two men to win the G1 as IWGP Heavyweight Champion (Kensuke Sasaki would achieve this feat in 2000). Mutoh held the IWGP title throughout the rest of the year, leading New Japan in the opening battles of the feud with Nobuhiko Takada and the UWF-i army before losing his title to Takada on January 4, 1996 at the Tokyo Dome. The latter half of 1996 had Mutoh pitted against Chono's Ookami Gundan\\u2014or Wolf Army, which eventually blossomed into a war with the Chono-led nWo Japan. In the process, Mutoh began teasing at a possible turn to the side of the nWo, proclaiming himself to be the true successor to Antonio Inoki's legacy, and \\\"accidentally\\\" attacking his own partners in the middle of a match.</p>\\n<p>During this period, Mutoh underwent a long slump in big matches, losing not only to members of the nWo, but fellow New Japan wrestlers such as Hashimoto; and many times the turn was teased. Mutoh would even wear an nWo shirt only to proclaim days later that he refuses to join Chono's army. Mutoh further raised confusion by playing both sides of the feud; fighting as a member of New Japan under his real name, and as The Great Muta in nWo Japan, before being The Great Muta full-time for several months in 1997. The full turn came in September 1997, when Mutoh, after teasing a turn on his nWo teammates, double-crossed Sasaki and Kazuo Yamazaki, sealing away the Muta name and formally joining nWo Japan as himself. Almost immediately following this, he and Chono dominated the tag team scene in NJPW, defeating Yamazaki and Sasaki for their second IWGP tag title reign as a duo, and spray-painting the plates of the belts black as a show of disrespect for the championship's legacy.</p>\\n<p>They eventually would be forced to vacate the title in May 1998, when Mutoh injured his knees, as his years of using the moonsault press were finally catching up to him. During this time, he took a hiatus from action, returning just before the 1998 G1 Climax (from which he was eliminated by Genichiro Tenryu in the first round). Despite his return, Mutoh was plagued by this nagging injury, fighting through his pain throughout the rest of 1998 and all of 1999; even winning his third IWGP Heavyweight title from one of Chono's right-hand men, Scott Norton. Towards the end of 1998, Mutoh took the leadership of nWo Japan, after Chono suffered a neck injury and was out of action, turning the nWo into a face stable, which Chono didn't like. Mutoh feuded with Chono for the name of the nWo, which evolved into a war between the nWo, led by Mutoh, Hiroyoshi Tenzan, and Satoshi Kojima and Chono's new <i>Team 2000</i> unit, with himself, Don Frye, Super J, and others from the old generation of the nWo. On December 10, 1999, Mutoh lost the IWGP Championship to Tenryu. The war between Chono and Mutoh was lost by Mutoh by January 2000, brought about by his decisive loss to Chono on January 4. Mutoh took an extended hiatus to rehabilitate his damaged knees after that, focusing instead on one last run in America for World Championship Wrestling alongside Vampiro. Due to the bad booking and the decline of WCW in its last years, however, Mutoh could not recapture the previous popularity he had in the late 1980s and early 1990s. After leaving WCW, a no-compete clause in his WCW contract prevented him from competing in the World Wrestling Federation.</p>\\n\\n<p>Going back on hiatus, it seemed as if Mutoh reached a confusing crossroads in his career; however, he chose to completely change his image, shaving his head bald (he had a pronounced receding hairline throughout much of 2000), growing out a goatee, and aligning himself with a fellow NJPW wrestler who had gone overseas for an extended period of time, Shinjiro Otani. The two returned to New Japan on January 4, 2001 at Wrestling World 2001, making short work of Manabu Nakanishi and Jushin Thunder Liger. In his first singles match after returning to New Japan on March 18, 2001, Mutoh debuted his new trademark move, the <i>Shining Wizard</i>. Since its creation, it has become an extremely popular move on both sides of the Pacific, used by Mutoh's allies, rivals, and fans of his work. Together with Don Frye, Otani and Mutoh created a new stable which later came to be known as BATT (Bad Ass Translate Trading). Added to their ranks were Taiy\\u014d Kea of All Japan Pro Wrestling and Jinsei Shinzaki of Michinoku Pro; later added was Hiroshi Hase, now a member of All Japan with Kea. 2001 proved to be Mutoh's year of renewal besides the formation of a new unit, as he challenged, and defeated, Tenryu for All Japan's coveted Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. In addition, Mutoh captured more gold in the form of All Japan's World Tag Team Championship and IWGP Tag Team Championship in the summer and fall of 2001, both with Taiy\\u014d Kea\\u2014giving Mutoh a total of six belts at one time.</p>\\n<p>On January 4, 2008, at Wrestle Kingdom II in Tokyo Dome, under the Muta persona, he defeated Hirooki Goto. On April 27, 2008, Mutoh beat Shinsuke Nakamura to win his fourth IWGP Heavyweight Championship, this was his second appearance in 2008 for NJPW and hadn't held the title for eight years and four months prior to the win. Mutoh went on to defend the IWGP championship against Manabu Nakanishi, Togi Makabe and Goto and at New Japan's Destruction '08 show on October 13, he defended the title against Shinsuke Nakamura in a rematch and retained following a Frankensteiner.</p>\\n<p>On January 4, 2009, Mutoh put the IWGP Heavyweight Championship on the line at NJPW's Wrestle Kingdom III in Tokyo Dome against his former student Hiroshi Tanahashi. Mutoh lost the match, when Tanahashi used his signature High Fly Flow twice to get the pin. After the match, Mutoh said backstage that he had passed Tanahashi his sash after doing his best for over half a year to raise the worth of the title, and suggested that he will withdraw and leave New Japan to move their company forward.</p>\\n<p>On January 4, 2012, Mutoh made a return to New Japan at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, where he defeated Tetsuya Naito in a singles match. A year later at Wrestle Kingdom 7 in Tokyo Dome, Mutoh teamed with Shinjiro Otani, a replacement for an injured Daichi Hashimoto, in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima. Mutoh returned to New Japan again a year later at Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome, now working as The Great Muta in a tag team match, where he and Toru Yano defeated <i>Suzukigun</i> (Minoru Suzuki and Shelton X Benjamin). As the only face in the match, Muta turned on Yano towards the end of the match, but his green mist accidentally hit Suzuki instead, leading to Yano pinning him for the win.</p>\\n<h3>All Japan Pro Wrestling (2002\\u20132013)</h3>\\n\\n<p>On January 11, 2002, following the end of a year long cross-promotional <i>angle</i> with New Japan Pro Wrestling, Keiji Mutoh shocked the Japanese wrestling world by defecting to All-Japan as a full-time competitor, taking Satoshi Kojima and Kendo Kashin with him. At the Nippon Budokan on July 20, Mutoh wrestled as three different characters on the card: Kokushi Muso defeating Kaz Hayashi on the second match, himself in the mid-card, and in the second-to-last match, he defeated Kojima, under his \\\"Great Koji\\\" persona, as The Great Muta. On September 30, during an All Japan 30th Anniversary party at the famed Tokyo City Hotel, Mokoto Baba officially announced Mutoh's appointment as the new president of All Japan, transferring all of the Baba family stock to him. Despite this position, however, Mutoh has not stopped wrestling full-time for All Japan, and lead his supporters in feuds with the Voodoo Murders. On December 27, 2003, Mutoh made a return to the United States, wrestling for the Ring of Honor promotion as part of an interpromotional <i>All Japan vs. ROH</i> card, which hosted a series of \\\"dream\\\" matches. In the main event, Mutoh reverted to his Great Muta persona and teamed with Arashi to defeat Prophecy members Christopher Daniels and Dan Maff.</p>\\n<p>He made his European debut on January 12, 2007, wrestling for Real Quality Wrestling at the York Hall in Bethnal Green, London, England, where he defeated RQW Heavyweight Champion Martin Stone in a non-title match. Mutoh recently won the 2007 Champion Carnival, competing in Block A and finishing with 6 points total; Mutoh defeated Toshiaki Kawada in the finals on March 30, 2007.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Keiji_Mutoh_2009.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q927964\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":4225610,\"title\":\"Hubert Chesshyre\",\"text\":\"<p><b>David Hubert Boothby Chesshyre, CVO</b> (born 22 June 1940) is a former member of the British Royal Household.</p>\\n<p>Chesshyre served for more than forty years as an officer of arms to Queen Elizabeth II. In his senior appointment he served as Clarenceux King of Arms, the second most senior heraldic appointment in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and certain Commonwealth realms. He also held other senior public appointments, including those of Registrar of the College of Arms, Secretary of the Order of the Garter, and Honorary Genealogist to the Royal Victorian Order, of which he is himself a Commander. Chesshyre's heraldic and genealogical clients included former Prime Minister Edward Heath, former Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, former Attorney General Peter Rawlinson, the current Speaker John Bercow, the former Speaker Betty Boothroyd, and senior clerics in the Church of England, such as former Archbishop of York David Hope, as well as actor John Hurt, former Beatle Paul McCartney, author Terry Pratchett, and businessman Alan Sugar. Chesshyre is also the author or editor of eight books and the author of numerous articles and reviews.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Family background</h2>\\n<p>In the patrilineal line Chesshyre belongs to the family of Isacke of North Foreland Lodge. The family name was changed by his father, Colonel Hubert Chesshyre, late RA, from Isacke to Chesshyre. Colonel Chesshyre, born Hubert Isacke, was the son of Major General Hubert Isacke, CB, CSI, CMG, six times mentioned in despatches, late Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment. Major General Chesshyre's father was Colonel Henry Isacke, late RA, himself the son of Robert Isacke, Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Kent, sometime Commander in the Honourable East India Company Maritime Service.</p>\\n<p>Robert Isacke's wife, Chesshyre's 2nd-great-grandmother, Matilda Scrymgeour-Wedderburn, was the daughter of Henry Scrymgeour-Wedderburn, <i>de jure</i> 7th Earl of Dundee, and great-granddaughter of Charles Maitland, 6th Earl of Lauderdale, through his son Captain the Hon Frederick Maitland, RN. Chesshyre has written that he is proud, as an English herald, to be related, through his 2nd-great-grandmother, to both the Bearer of the Royal Banner (Alexander Scrymgeour, 12th Earl of Dundee) and the Bearer of the National Flag of Scotland (Ian Maitland, 18th Earl of Lauderdale).</p>\\n<p>Through Henry Isacke's wife, Louisa Chesshyre, subsequent generations of the family are descended from the family of Chesshyre of Barton Court, Canterbury. Louisa Chesshyre's father was the Reverend William Chesshyre, Rector of Canterbury St Martin and St Paul, Rural Dean of Canterbury, Proctor in Convocation for the Diocese of Canterbury, and Canon of Canterbury Cathedral. Canon Chesshyre's father was Vice-Admiral of the Blue John Chesshyre. Through this common ancestry Chesshyre is a first cousin twice removed of the Law Lord Lord Tomlin.</p>\\n<p>Through his paternal grandmother Ada Layard, Chesshyre is also descended from the Huguenot family of de Layarde, anglicised as Layard. Chesshyre's great-grandfather in this line is Sir Charles Layard, who was Attorney General of Ceylon 1892\\u20131902 and Chief Justice of Ceylon 1902\\u20131906, and was himself the son of Sir Charles Layard, KCMG, Government Agent for the Western Provinces of Ceylon 1851\\u201378, himself in turn the grandson in the maternal line of Gualterus Mooyaart, Administrator of Jaffna for the Dutch East India Company. Another of Chesshyre's 3rd-great-grandfathers in this line was Lieutenant Colonel Clement Edwards, Assistant Military Secretary to Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, son-in-law of his 4th-great-grandfather the Very Reverend Dr Charles Layard, FRS, Dean of Bristol 1800\\u201303, himself the son of Daniel Layard, DCL, DM, LCP, FRS. The family was established in England by Chesshyre's 6th-great-grandfather Pierre de Layarde, of Monflanquin, who attended William, Prince of Orange during the Glorious Revolution, eventually attaining the rank of Major, settled at Canterbury, and became a British subject in 1713, adopting the name Peter Layard. Appropriately, Peter Layard married his wife Marie Anne Croz\\u00e9 on 2 March 1716/17 at the church of St Benet's, Paul's Wharf, the church of the College of Arms.</p>\\n<p>Through his mother, Katharine Boothby, daughter of Major Basil Boothby, RE, Chesshyre's 3rd-great-grandfather was Major Sir William Boothby, 7th baronet, 51st (2nd Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment of Foot, and Chesshyre is therefore a relation of the Boothby baronets of Broadlow Ash. Chesshyre's uncle, his mother's brother, was Basil Boothby, CMG, who served as British ambassador to Iceland and married Susan Asquith, a granddaughter of the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith.</p>\\n<p>Interestingly, Chesshyre is the 10th-great-grandson of Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby (1485 creation), by his illegitimate son also called Henry Stanley. He is in turn descended from Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby, who in 1555 presented Derby Place to the Crown as the home of the Heralds' College (now the College of Arms). Chesshyre is therefore also the 12th-great-grandson of John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk (1483 creation), himself the grandson of Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk (1397 creation), grandson of Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk (1397 creation <i>suo jure</i> for life), granddaughter of Edward I of England. Chesshyre is appropriately a relation of the Lords and Earls Marshal and Hereditary Marshals of England, who are the heads of the College of Arms, where he was an officer for so many years, and of many Knights and Ladies of the Order of the Garter, of which he was Secretary. Through Chesshyre's Derby connection it is possible to trace his ancestry to many of the royal and noble families of Europe.</p>\\n<p>Chesshyre is also a kinsman of Sir John Chesshyre (1662\\u20131738), Prime Serjeant at Law to Queen Anne and King George I. It was his inheriting a portrait of Sir John that sparked Chesshyre's interest in genealogy. In 1976 Chesshyre attended the ceremony to mark the reopening of the Chesshyre Library, Halton, Cheshire, founded by Sir John in 1733. To mark the occasion a painting of the arms of Sir John and Lady Chesshyre, donated by the Chesshyre family, and produced by the College of Arms, was presented to the library.</p>\\n<h2>Coat of arms</h2>\\n<p>Although Chesshyre's family coat of arms has been in use since the seventeenth century, it was only formally granted in 1970, when Chesshyre was himself first appointed a member of the College of Arms. An image of his coat of arms may be seen on the Cheshire Heraldry website: The Armorial Bearings of the Chester Heralds. Copyright Martin Goldstraw. Accessed 30 April 2010.</p>\\n<h2>Education and early career</h2>\\n<p>Chesshyre was educated at St Michael's Preparatory School, Otford (contemporary with John Hurt and a pupil of Roy Martin Haines) and The King's School, Canterbury (The Grange House 1954\\u201359). He maintains a close relationship with The King's School. In 2010 the school's Legacy Club (a club for Old King's Scholars pledging a proportion of their estate to the school) launched a tie whose design was contributed to by Chesshyre. The tie is blue scattered with silver mitres and golden crowns, reflecting the dual influence of Church and State on the school and the ways in which OKS have served both Church and State in return.</p>\\n<p>Chesshyre undertook his undergraduate education at Trinity College, Cambridge (BA in French and German and MA). After graduating from Cambridge Chesshyre spent about four years working as a schoolmaster and vintner, including working for Mo\\u00ebt et Chandon and John Harvey &amp; Sons. He then studied at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was awarded a Diploma in Education in 1967.</p>\\n<p>Despite his background in a military family, Chesshyre served only briefly in the Honourable Artillery Company from 1964 until 1965. While serving with the HAC he fired the 19-gun salute at the Tower of London for the state funeral of Winston Churchill.</p>\\n<h2>Heraldic career</h2>\\n<p>Chesshyre was a Green Staff Officer at the Investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969. Appointed a member of the College of Arms the following year, he served as Rouge Croix Pursuivant (1970\\u201378), Chester Herald (1978\\u201395), Norroy and Ulster King of Arms and Principal Herald of the North part of England and of Northern Ireland (1995\\u201397), and Clarenceux King of Arms and Principal Herald for the South, East and West parts of England (1997\\u20132010). From 1971 until 1978 he also served on the staff of Anthony Wagner. He was Registrar of the College of Arms from 1992 until 2000 and was the Founder Secretary of the College Uniform Fund in 1980, serving in that capacity until 1999.</p>\\n<p>Chesshyre was Secretary of the Order of the Garter from 1988 until 2003, having been trained for the role by his predecessor Walter Verco and by Verco's predecessor-but-one, Anthony Wagner. Upon his resignation from this office Chesshyre enjoyed the honour of an audience with The Queen at Buckingham Palace, during which he surrendered his badge of office. Following the 1992 Windsor Castle fire Chesshyre was, together with Peter Begent, appointed heraldic consultant for the reconstruction of St George's Hall. Chesshyre was also Honorary Genealogist of The Society of the Friends of St George's and Descendants of the Knights of the Garter.</p>\\n<p>Chesshyre served for twenty-three years as Honorary Genealogist to the Royal Victorian Order (1987\\u20132010), again, succeeding Walter Verco.</p>\\n<p>As Ulster King of Arms (merged with Norroy) Chesshyre also held the extant, if effectively defunct, offices of King of Arms, Registrar, and Knight Attendant of the Order of St Patrick, meaning that he was, technically, briefly one of the two members of the Order, the other being Queen Elizabeth II as Sovereign.</p>\\n<p>From early in his career Chesshyre from time to time served as Deputy to Garter Principal King of Arms for the purpose of introducing peers into the House of Lords. For example, in 1975 he introduced Baroness Vickers.</p>\\n<p>Chesshyre retired from the College of Arms on 31 August 2010. His last public duties took place at the State Opening of Parliament on 25 May 2010 and at the Garter Day ceremony on 14 June 2010. Commentating on the State Opening for the BBC, Huw Edwards remarked upon Chesshyre's forty years of service.</p>\\n<h2>Heraldic clients</h2>\\n<p>The following is a partial list of clients for whom Chesshyre acted as agent for a grant of arms.

He succeeded in tracing Heseltine's ancestors down to the end of the eighteenth century, but dropped his enquiries after Heseltine was informed that further research would cost him \\u00a3350. Between 1970 and 1975 Chesshyre also undertook work on behalf of the Rt Hon Sir Peter Rawlinson, QC, MP, Attorney General for England and Wales and Attorney General for Northern Ireland.</p>\\n<h2>Further public career and professional activities</h2>\\n<p>In his personal capacity, Chesshyre served as heraldic advisor to the committee that organised the re-enactment of the funeral of Arthur, Prince of Wales in Worcester on 3 May 2002. On the day of the re-enactment, Chesshyre processed through the streets of Worcester bearing Arthur's crested helm, followed by other heralds bearing his sword, tabard, gauntlets, and spurs.</p>\\n<p>In 2006 Chesshyre had the honour of participating in the 27th International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences at St Salvator's College University of St Andrews in the presence of HRH The Princess Royal.</p>\\n\\n<p>Chesshyre has enjoyed a long professional association with Westminster Abbey. In 1973 he completed at the request of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey a report entitled 'The Restoration of the Regalia to the Tomb of Queen Elizabeth the First in Westminster Abbey: Research into the Identity of the Collar Missing from the Queen's Marble Effigy'. He found 'that there was no clear evidence that the missing collar was a Garter collar', suggesting instead 'the \\\"Three Brothers\\\" pendant and collar shown in the Ermine portrait of Queen Elizabeth as a suitable model for the restoration'. He was later a member of the Abbey's Architectural Advisory Panel, from 1985 until 1998, and then of its Fabric Commission, from 1998 until 2003. Chesshyre was also heraldic advisor for the west window of the Henry VII Lady Chapel, donated by John Templeton and devised by Donald Buttress, which The Queen unveiled on 19 October 1995.</p>\\n<p>Chesshyre has worked as a freelance lecturer in the United Kingdom and abroad. For many years he lectured for the National Association of Decorative and Fine Arts Societies and Speaker Finders.</p>\\n<p>On 1 October 2005 Chesshyre appeared at the Windsor Festival, introducing Roy Strong.</p>\\n<h2>Published comment and commentary</h2>\\n<p>Interviewed by <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> in connection with the arms of Margaret and Denis Thatcher, Chesshyre said of his profession, 'A herald gets \\u00a317.80 per annum from the Queen. We did get a 100 per cent pay rise in 1617 but they reduced it again in 1831. We get part of the client's fee but it's not a job you do for the money.'</p>\\n<p>In 1981 Chesshyre was interviewed for a story in the German magazine <i>Der Spiegel</i>, where he elucidated aspects of the origins of heraldry and commented on the depiction of the sexual organs of animals in coats of arms.</p>\\n<p>Anthony Sampson referred to Chesshyre in his book <i>The Changing Anatomy of Britain</i>: 'Christ Church maintains its traditional disdain for twentieth-century activities, with an annual newsletter which reads like a parody of British snobberies, beginning with honours, Lords Lieutenants and royal service ('Mr DHB Chesshyre, formerly Rouge Croix Pursuivant, aptly became Chester Herald of Arms'), and ending with vulgar achievements in business, journalism and sport.'</p>\\n<p>Chesshyre is mentioned in the diaries of James Lees-Milne, who described him as 'handsome though over fifty, and charming to talk to'.</p>\\n<h2>Scholarship</h2>\\n<p><i>The Most Noble Order of the Garter</i>, which Chesshyre co-authored with Peter Begent and Lisa Jefferson, enjoyed the distinction of a foreword by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (p.\\u00a02) and of being 'Dedicated with permission to|Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Elizabeth II|Thirtieth Sovereign of the Order' (p.\\u00a04). One of the book's reviewers, John Goodall, wrote that it had been 'eagerly awaited' and was 'the most comprehensive' study of the subject since that of Elias Ashmole, and he wrote that it was 'unlikely to be superseded'. Another reviewer, Maurice Keen, wrote that it was 'invaluable to scholars whose interests touch on the history of the order, from the widest variety of points of view and period specialisation' and that 'Altogether, Peter Begent and Hubert Chesshyre have put together a volume that for its thoroughness, its interest and its physical attraction is a worthy tribute to the longevity of England's highest order of chivalry.' M.K. Ridgway, reviewing <i>The Identification of Coats of Arms on British Silver</i>, wrote that Chesshyre 'has the undoubted gift of making a difficult and complicated subject both exciting and interesting'. <i>The Green</i>, which Chesshyre co-authored with A.J. Robinson, was described by Victor E. Neuburg as 'The best\\u2014indeed only\\u2014comprehensive account of the subject'. During the period around 1970 to 1980 Chesshyre wrote another book on the history of Bethnal Green, <i>Number Seventeen, or the History of 17 Old Ford Road, Bethnal Green and the Natt Family</i>. Although the book, though complete, has never been published, a copy is held, together with notes, maps, and correspondence, at the Tower Hamlets Local History Library and Archives.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Hubert_Chesshyre.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q428762\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":82673,\"title\":\"John Ruiz\",\"text\":\"<p><b>John \\\"The Quietman\\\" Ruiz</b> (born January 4, 1972) is an American former professional boxer.

Known as 'Daddy', Beackon first stood as a candidate for the BNP in 1990 in the Redcoat ward of London Borough of Tower Hamlets where he gained 3% of the vote, a typically low total for the party at the time.</p>\\n<p>Although Beackon's personal result had been a disappointment in Tower Hamlets the area had slowly been growing as a centre of support for the BNP. A series of council by-elections in 1990 had seen the BNP, which at the time still lagged behind the National Front in terms of public profile (even though that movement had fallen into severe decline), gain respectable scores whilst the area had also been one of the centres of support for John Tyndall during the 1992 general election; Tyndall had stood in Bow and Poplar, which included much of Tower Hamlets.</p>\\n<p>Under the directorship of local organizer Eddy Butler the party had instigated a 'Rights for Whites' campaign in the area, bringing back a slogan previously employed by Martin Webster during the 1970s. Focusing on the perceived negative impact of immigration on the area of employment and housing, the campaign initially operated as if it was simply a local pressure group before gradually introducing the BNP name into Rights for Whites literature.</p>\\n<p>The initiative first produced results in the Millwall ward in October 1992 when a strong canvassing effort by local activists saw BNP candidate Barry Osborne capture 20% of the vote in a by-election. Millwall had long been a seat of unemployment associated with the declining docklands area. Most of the population had been descended from the 19th century workers who had built and operated the docks, but with the building of the Limehouse Link Road, a run-down Council estate in Limehouse (the St Vincent Estate) containing predominantly Bangladeshi families, were rehoused in properties in Millwall, previously marketed as 'luxury', but due to a property downturn had failed to sell. This was presented as favourable treatment on grounds of race by the \\\"Liberal Focus Team\\\" seeking to capitalise on the issue. However, in a close three way contest, the BNP gained from this campaign more than its authors.</p>\\n<p>A Labour councillor resigned in the same ward soon after this, sparking another by-election on 16 September 1993. Beackon was chosen as the candidate this time, following the local party's policy of rotating members. Beackon's campaign followed Butler's blueprint of emphasising 'Rights for Whites' through canvassing and leafleting, although he abandoned the old policy of holding a public meeting as he felt they proved too counterproductive by attracting large crowds of protesters, particularly from the Anti-Nazi League and Anti-Fascist Action. In the event Beackon won the by-election of 16 September 1993 with 1480 votes (33.9%), beating Labour by 7 votes, with an overall turnout of 44%. He thus became the first elected representative for the party.</p>\\n<h3>Reaction to Beackon's win</h3>\\n<p>The immediate reaction to Beackon's election was one of widespread condemnation from many sections of wider society. The <i>Daily Mirror</i> headline of 18 September read 'SIEG HEIL...and Now He's a British Councillor' setting the tone for a slew of condemnation on the basis of Beackon being a Nazi. Amongst those to make their outrage heard were the main political parties, the Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey and the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Paul Condon. Beackon's own use of immoderate language also damaged him and he was quoted in the <i>Daily Mirror</i> after being asked about refuse collection that \\\"The Asians are rubbish and that is what we are going to clear from the streets\\\". However, Labour also criticised the Liberal Democrats for distributing a leaflet <i>How Labour Spends your Money</i>, detailing how Labour allegedly spent \\u00a330,000 and \\u00a3175,000 respectively on Bangladeshi flood relief and youth movements, then asking \\\"Has it helped you recently?\\\", causing anger in the local community.</p>\\n<h2>Beackon as a councillor</h2>\\n<p>As a councillor, Beackon found it hard to discharge his duties effectively, due to a boycott by other councillors and staff, who staged a protest walk-out after his election and due to his own inexperience and lack of capability - resulting in the BNP press office having to speak for him, after he failed to distinguish between the housing and social service departments in a newspaper interview with the <i>East London Advertiser</i>. He also had to flee his flat in Wapping to live in hiding with his brother in Bethnal Green during which time his housing benefit was cancelled. In addition, the expectation that he could influence housing allocation to benefit white constituents proved chimerical. Overall, during his time in office Beackon was characterized as a weak councillor who had trouble following the council agenda. Indeed at the time it was even suggested that Beackon was virtually illiterate and was unable to read council documents; he later strenuously denied the allegations while admitting that he had trouble understanding their meaning.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q5261794\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":3352212,\"title\":\"Kali Meehan\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Kalivati Gerald Meehan</b> (born 9 March 1970 in New Zealand) is an Australian-based New Zealand boxer, turned pro after a career in Rugby league.

In 2009, he was awarded the Kulturpreis der Deutschen Gesellschaft f\\u00fcr Photographie (The Culture Prize of the German Society for Photography). Tillmans lives in Berlin and London.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Life and career</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>Tillmans was born on August 16, 1968 in Remscheid.</p>\\n<p>During his first visit to England as an exchange student in 1983, he discovered the British youth culture and the local fashion and music magazines of the time. From 1987 through 1990, he lived in Hamburg where he also had his first solo exhibitions at Caf\\u00e9 Gnosa, Front and Frarik-Foto-Forum. From 1990 through 1992, he studied at Bournemouth and Poole College of Art and Design in southern England. After his studies he moved to London and then to New York in 1994 for a year, where he met the German painter Jochen Klein. After moving back to England, Tillmans lived with Klein until he died of AIDS-related complications in 1997.</p>\\n<p>From 1995, Wolfgang Tillmans primarily lived and worked in London. During the summer of 1998, Tillmans participated in a month-long residency at the last active Shaker community in the world, in Sabbathday Lake, Maine. Since 2007, he has divided his time between Berlin and London. Following a guest professorship at the Hochschule f\\u00fcr bildende Kunst in Hamburg from 1998 to 1999 and his Honorary Fellowship at the Arts University College at Bournemouth in 2001, Tillmans had been a professor for Interdisciplinary Art at the St\\u00e4delschule in Frankfurt am Main from 2003 till 2006. In 2001, Tillmans was awarded first prize in the competition for the design of the AIDS memorial for the City of Munich, whereupon the memorial was erected after his designs at the Sendlinger Tor. In 2011, Tillmans travelled to Haiti with the charity Christian Aid to document reconstruction work after the country's devastating earthquake one year before.</p>\\n<p>Between 2009 and 2014, Tillmans is serving as an Artist Trustee of the Tate Board. He also is a member of the museum's Collection Committee and the Tate Britain Council.</p>\\n<h2>Work</h2>\\n<h3>Beginnings</h3>\\n\\n<p>Wolfgang Tillmans was initially known for his seemingly casual, sometimes snapshotlike portraits of friends (most notably, fashion designer Lutz Huelle and fellow artist Alexandra Bircken) and other youth in his immediate surroundings and scene. His photos \\u2013 from the Europride in London (1992) or the Love Parade in Berlin (1992) for example \\u2013 appeared in magazines such as <i>i-D, Spex, Interview, SZ-Magazin</i> and <i>Butt-Magazine</i>, and have established his reputation as a prominent witness of a contemporary social movement. He was made co-editor of <i>Spex</i> in 1997. For the <i>Index Magazine</i>, he shot covers and assignments, including images of John Waters, Gilbert &amp; George, and Udo Kier.</p>\\n<p>Tillmans was considered the \\u201cdocumentarian of his generation, especially that of the London club and gay scenes.\\u201d Half of his work is staged, with the artist choosing the clothes and the location, as well as setting his models up in their positions. The series of his friends Lutz and Alex, also published in <i>i-D</i> in 1992, are considered important photographic documents of the 1990s. From 1992 to 1994 Tillmans lived and worked in London, moving to New York in 1994. During this time, he began to show more frequently, developing an exhibition style that consisted of nonhierarchical arrangements of unframed photographs pinned or taped onto the gallery\\u2019s walls. Color photographs are placed next to inkjet prints and next to postcards and magazine clippings of his own images, reaching almost to the ceiling and the floor. He views each exhibition as a site-specific installation, often addressing the exhibition space as a larger composition.</p>\\n<h3>\\\"Pictures, in order to see the world\\u201d</h3>\\n<p>Wolfgang Tillmans\\u2019 photographic practice has since developed to encompass a wide array of genres. His portraits, still lifes, sky photographs (i.e. the <i>Concorde</i> series), astrophotography, aerial shots and landscapes were all motivated equally by aesthetic and political interests and in formulations of reality and truth claims \\u2013 particularly in relation to homosexuality and gender identity. Tillmans puts it like this: \\u201cI take pictures, in order to see the world.\\u201d Tillmans produces his photographs in different sizes and formats in meticulous wall-installations, combining them with photocopies, magazine and newspaper clippings (particularly in the installation known as \\u201cSoldiers \\u2013 The Nineties\\u201d). The photographs are sometimes taped directly onto the wall, presented in vitrines, or arranged on extensive table-installations (\\u201ctruth study center\\u201d). Operating on the basis of the fundamental equality of all motifs and supports, through this continual re-arranging, repositioning, questioning and reinforcement, Tillmans avoids ascribing any \\u2018conclusions\\u2019 to his work and thus repeatedly subjects his own photographic vision to a perpetual re-contextualization.</p>\\n<p>In 2009, after Tillmans had been using an analog 50\\u00a0mm Contax SLR camera almost exclusively for over two decades, he turned to digital photography. In 2012, he described the corresponding change from using viewfinders to integrated camera monitors as \\\"completely turning onto its head the psychology of photography, which has always been a dialogue between photographer, object and the imaginary image which one is envisioning, thinking, hoping for\\\", whereas the higher resolution of digital photographies follows \\\"a transformation in the whole world\\\", according to Tillmans: \\\"In recent years, everything has become HD, so I think it is inevitable that the overwhelming nature of this information density is reflected in my images. Hence, they are describing my feeling of perception quite well again today.\\\"</p>\\n<h4>Grids</h4>\\n<p>The 56 photographs of equal dimensions that make up the <i>Concorde Grid</i> were taken in and around London as part of a commission for Tillmans\\u2019 exhibition at Chisenhale Gallery in 1997. They were shot from a wide range of places including private gardens, parks, railway tracks and the perimeter fence around Heathrow airport, recording the daily passing of the airplane. <i>Total Solar Eclipse Grid</i> (1998), a set of which was included in his Turner Prize installation and is now in the permanent collection of the Tate, documents the spectacle of a solar eclipse. Each of the 21 photographs in the grid was taken during the eclipse of his immediate surroundings in a tropical locale, with varying degrees of light and detail. <i>Snow/Ice Grid</i> (1999) is a grid of images of trampled and melting ice and snow.</p>\\n<h4>Abstractions</h4>\\n\\n\\n<p>Tillmans exhibited his first abstract and damaged pictures as a Parkett edition in 1998. The edition, 60 unique works on color-negative photographic paper collected by the artist since he began colour printing in 1990, was a combination of true darkroom mistakes and years of darkroom experimentation that they inspired. The <i>Silver</i> works, which Tillmans has been creating since 1998, reflect the reaction of the photographic paper to light as well as mechanical and chemical processes. The name <i>Silver</i> arises from the dirt traces and silver salt stains that remain on the paper when the artist develops the photographs in a machine that is filled with water and has not been completely cleaned. Since 2000, Tillmans has become increasingly interested in the chemical foundations of photographic material as well as its haptic and spatial possibilities. The \\\"Conquistador\\\" series of photographs were the first of these interventions to be exhibited. Later works, created directly in the darkroom without the use of a camera and often largely accidental, (i.e. \\u201cBlushes\\u201d, \\\"Mental Pictures\\\", and \\u201cFreischwimmer\\u201d), present photography as a self-referential medium\\u2014one that could serve as an experimental ground for the creation of a new type of image structure. These \\u201cabstract\\u201d works now appear next to the figurative photographs. In \\\"Blushes\\\", fine, thread-like lines, apparently drawn with light, swim over the surface of the photographic paper, and create delicate, fluid patterns. Tillmans further explores the bounds of photography as a medium in his \\u201cpaper drop\\u201d series (2001\\u20138). Tillmans started to make \\u2018paper drop\\u2019 images depicting photographic paper specifically exposed to coloured light in his darkroom in 2001. He creates extraordinary sculptural forms in photographic paper, then by photographing them returns them to the accustomed flatness of that same medium. Photography\\u2019s step from \\u2018picture\\u2019 to \\u2018object\\u2019 is best demonstrated in the works from the \\u201cLighter\\u201d Series (2005\\u20138), in which the artist dropped the act of photographing and allowed the photographs - in their three-dimensional form - to only represent themselves, recalling his ongoing series \\\"Impossible Color\\\" (1996\\u2013present). These colourful photo-paper works are folded, creased or otherwise manipulated, allowing for a subtle play with the material surface and the resulting illusion of lines and contrast. Contained under Plexiglas lids, they have a rather sculptural quality.</p>\\n<h4>Photocopies</h4>\\n\\n<p>Tillman's first exhibition in 1988 was composed exclusively of images that were created with the latest kind of monochrome laser copier. He himself regards these so-called <i>Approach</i> pictures (1987\\u20131988) as \\\"first work before I even owned a camera\\\". Over the years, Tillmans has often returned to this medium, which has remained a fixed component in his work. The ways that surface structure and image depth influence each other is shown in Wolfgang Tillmans\\u2019 large-format works whose original material is analogue photocopies (ongoing since 2006). Here he also references his earlier works from the end of the 1980s that started by experimenting with an old Canon photocopier. The uncontrolled contrasts and pigment particles in the images from these old machines are clear only after drastic enlargement (framed ca. 260 x 180\\u00a0cm). The resulting effects are distanced but also concrete \\u2013 created through not only the materiality of the printing process but also the play and variation of scale. With the analogue photocopy \\u2013 probably the most ephemeral form of image (re)production \\u2013 a system of values for images is brought into a critical light.</p>\\n\\n<h4>Table works (\\\"truth study center\\\")</h4>\\n<p>In 2005, at his major supporter Maureen Paley's gallery, Tillmans showed his large-scale display-case installation <i>Truth Study Center</i>. Going even further than in his wall-installations, Tillmans\\u2019 table works combine a diverse array of image formats and content. His own photographs are presented and arranged under glass next to extracts from books, newspapers, magazines, postcards, packaging and other found materials. The collage-like arrangements of the table displays produce an open-ness and potentiality in terms of aesthetics and content while asking the critical question about the interpretive possibilities of the visible in a global information-society. With that, claims of absolute (in particular religious) truth are caricatured as if Tillmans would like to put them to a kind of test (\\u201ctruth study center\\u201d). The works draw attention to the exercise of power behind the ideologies of Islamic fundamentalism, Catholicism, and capitalism.</p>\\n<h3>Videos</h3>\\n<p><i>Lights (Body)</i> (2000\\u20132002), a video installation featuring static shots of the light effects inside an empty dance club with the bass pulse of the \\u2018Hacker Remix' of \\u2018Don't be Light' by Air, is the first work by the photographer using the medium of film. The only indication of people on the crowded dance floor are the subtle vibrations and occasionally visible particles of dust. In 2002, Tillmans filmed a video clip for the pop band Pet Shop Boys\\u2019 single \\\"Home and Dry\\\", composed almost entirely of shots documenting the mice living in the London Underground system. The film <i>Kopierer</i> (2010) depicts an open color laser copy machine, the CLC 1100, in the act of copying documents over a period of ten minutes.</p>\\n<h3>Music and art collaboration</h3>\\n<p>In 2011, Tillmans collaborated with The Opiates by offering a range of photographic images to accompany their CD \\\"Hollywood under the knife\\\" and an EP of remixes.</p>\\n<h2>Between Bridges</h2>\\n<p>Between April 2006 and late 2011, Tillmans maintained the non-profit exhibition space Between Bridges in the ground floor of his Bethnal Green studio, a former umbrella factory named Moarain House at 223 Cambridge Heath Road. The project took its name from a photograph taken by the artist in 1999 and refers to the studio's physical location between two rail bridges. The space was opened a show of works by the New York artist and activist David Wojnarowicz. In the small gallery he has developed a program of exhibitions with political art from other artists who he believes have not been given the proper attention they deserve, specifically in London. Previous exhibitions include Isa Genzken, Jenny Holzer, the films of Len Lye and the photographs from the Center for Land Use Interpretation. In January 2014, Between Bridges relocated to a former artist studio and gallery in Tiergarten, Berlin.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Tillmans_crop.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q704012\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":3807842,\"title\":\"Johnny Nelson\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Ivanson Ranny \\\"Johnny\\\" Nelson</b> (born 4 January 1967) is a former professional boxer from Sheffield, England.

Her performance earned comparisons to Carey Mulligan's Academy Award-nominated role in <i>An Education</i>. She also received the Best new Hollywood Award for this film at the 2011 Hollywood Film Awards. She appeared alongside <i>Gossip Girl</i> actor Ed Westwick in <i>Chalet Girl</i>, a romantic comedy released in March 2011, for which she had to undergo two months of snowboarding training and work undercover in a chalet at St Anton, scrubbing toilets and partying at the Krazy Kanguruh bar in preparation for the role. Jones said that the role was \\\"something of a relief\\\" after a string of costume roles and she was also keen to take on a comic role. Jones performed in <i>Luise Miller</i>, a new translation of Schiller's <i>Kabale und Liebe</i> by Mike Poulton at the Donmar Warehouse theatre in London, in June and July 2011.

In a \\\"loosely autobiographical\\\" film to be made of this event she only asked, in true documentary fashion, that \\\"The extras will all come from Margate and I'll hire a church hall there to hold auditions. I'll ask each of the girls: 'What is it you really hate about your mum?'\\\"</p>\\n<p>She studied fashion at Medway College of Design (now the University for the Creative Arts) (1980\\u20131982), where she met expelled student Billy Childish and was associated with The Medway Poets. Emin and Childish were a couple until 1987 during which time she was the administrator for his small press Hangman Books which specialized in publishing Childish's confessional poetry. In 1984 she studied printing at Maidstone Art College(now the University for the Creative Arts), which she has described as one of the best experiences of her life. In 1995 she was interviewed in the <i>Minky Manky</i> show catalogue by Carl Freedman, who asked her, \\\"Which person do you think has had the greatest influence on your life?\\\" She replied,</p>\\n<p>In 1987, Emin moved to London to study at the Royal College of Art, where she obtained an MA in painting, though she has described this time as a very negative experience. Her influences included Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele; later she destroyed all her paintings from this early period, and for a time studied philosophy at Birkbeck, University of London. One of the paintings that survives from her time at Royal College of Art is Friendship which is in the Royal College of Art Collection.</p>\\n<h2>Career</h2>\\n<h3>Beginnings</h3>\\n<p>In 1993, Emin opened a shop with fellow artist Sarah Lucas, called <i>The Shop</i> at 103 Bethnal Green Road in Bethnal Green. This sold works by the two of them, including T-shirts and ash trays with Damien Hirst's picture stuck to the bottom. Lucas paid Emin a wage to mind the shop and Emin also made extra money by writing letters to people asking them to invest \\u00a320 in her as an artist, one being Jay Jopling, who became her dealer. During this period Emin was also working with the gallerist Joshua Compston.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Tracey_Emin_1-cropped.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q241185\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":7290617,\"title\":\"Jeff Probyn\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Jeff Probyn</b> (born 27 April 1956 in Bethnal Green, London) is an English former Rugby Union player.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q1404165\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":8524194,\"title\":\"Travis Walker\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Travis Walker</b>, born June 22, 1979 in Tallahassee, Florida, is an American boxer who was an amateur star and is currently a professional heavyweight boxer.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q329658\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":0},{\"pageid\":7515079,\"title\":\"Billy Schwer\",\"text\":\"<p><b>William Schwer</b> (born 12 April 1969 in Luton, England), more commonly known as <b>Billy Schwer</b>, is a former professional boxer from Luton in Bedfordshire, England.</p>\\n<p>For the majority of his professional career, Schwer fought in the lightweight division but also competed in the light welterweight division.</p>\\n<p>He is the former British, Commonwealth and European lightweight and the IBO World Light Welter-weight title Champion.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Background</h2>\\n<p>Schwer's father was the Irish amateur title holder in the 1960s before he emigrated to England.</p>\\n<h3>Amateur career</h3>\\n<p>Schwer is a former nationals schoolboy title holder and represented England at youth and senior level.</p>\\n<p>At the 1990 ABA National Championships held at the Royal Albert Hall, London, Schwer represent the <i>Luton Irish Boxing Club</i> and was runner up to PJ Gallagher, in the lightweight (60\\u00a0kg], the same PJ Gallagher was known as Patrick Gallagher when billy lost in the final of the aba, and Patrick Joseph become the galeforce PJ Gallagher, A professional British super feather weight champion in 1996 to 1997.</p>\\n<h2>Professional career</h2>\\n<p>Schwer was trained by Jack Lindsay and fought out of his Luton base north of London.

A journeyman player, he has played for fifteen different clubs spanning five countries; England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Greece.</p>\\n<p>Having begun his career with Chelsea, he spent time on loan with Queens Park Rangers, Huddersfield Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion before joining the latter permanently in 2003. Knight spent three years with Brighton, scoring 30 goals in 106 league matches. He was transferred to Swansea City in 2006 and had a loan spell with Barnsley before joining Milton Keynes Dons and then Wycombe Wanderers.</p>\\n<p>Knight signed for Rushden &amp; Diamonds in 2008, but left the club five months later when he was sacked for misconduct. Rushden retained his registration and would not release it to another English club unless they were compensated, which prevented Knight from playing in England for three years. He subsequently played in Greece for Thrasivoulos Fylis, Scotland for Hamilton Academical and Queen of the South and Northern Ireland for Coleraine, before joining Glentoran in January 2012. He was released by Glentoran in June 2012 after a probationary clause in his contract was invoked by the club.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Club career</h2>\\n<p>Knight began his career as a trainee at Chelsea (where he made one appearance in the UEFA Cup against Levski Sofia), before spending loan periods at Queens Park Rangers, Huddersfield Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion before joining Brighton on a permanent contract in August 2003. During his spell at Huddersfield, he reignited the Terriers' play-off push and formed an unlikely partnership with local hero Andy Booth, earning himself the nickname 'Neon Light'. Unfortunately, he was sent off in the penultimate game of the season and was suspended for the play-off games. Although his transfer was initially free, \\u00a350,000 was to be paid if Brighton were promoted. It was Knight himself who secured Brighton's promotion with his penalty against Bristol City in the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff in 2004. Knight had a falling out with Brighton manager Mark McGhee, which culminated in Knight being thrown off the team bus in the middle of the New Forest en route to a match against Southampton on 2 January 2006.</p>\\n<p>Knight moved to Swansea City shortly afterwards, and scored a hat-trick on his debut against Milton Keynes Dons. His stay at the Liberty Stadium was short-lived, and he was placed on the transfer list in October 2006, due to a poor attitude. After a short spell on loan with Barnsley, he joined Milton Keynes Dons in January 2007. In January 2008, Knight signed for Wycombe Wanderers, just one year after joining MK Dons. On 19 August 2008, Knight's contract was \\\"terminated by mutual consent\\\", after he scored five goals in 20 appearances during his short stay with Wycombe.</p>\\n<p>Knight signed for Rushden &amp; Diamonds on a three-year contract on 24 August 2008. but was transfer listed on 29 October, along with Lee Tomlin, Curtis Woodhouse, Andy Burgess, Phil Gulliver, Sagi Burton, Lee Phillips and Dean McDonald, after the club's poor start to the season. On 12 December, Rushden &amp; Diamonds confirmed that Knight had been sacked after continual breaches of conduct between November and December 2008. Despite his contract having been terminated, Rushden &amp; Diamonds retained the players registration, preventing Knight from joining another English club until the term of his contract had expired, unless \\u00a330,000 in compensation was paid to the club. The FA confirmed and validated the retaining of the registration, meaning Knight could not play at any level of English football until the contract had expired. The contract had initially been due to expire following the 2009\\u201310 season, but Rushden &amp; Diamonds invoked a clause allowing them to extend the contract by a further year.</p>\\n<p>On 13 January 2009, Knight joined Greek club Thrasivoulos Filis on a six-month contract. He made his Super League debut on 25 January as a second half sub playing 20 minutes against Skoda Xanthi. Knight made only 2 subsequent appearances as a sub, his last appearance coming on 8 February 2009. Knight had not been involved in any game for the club in over 3 months and looked certain to leave Thrasivoulos when his contract expired at the end of the season. After his contract expired he went on trial with Major League Soccer side San Jose Earthquakes.</p>\\n<p>Knight joined Scottish side Hamilton Academical on 21 August 2009, and he made his SPL debut against Aberdeen as a second half substitute the following day. He made one start and six substitute appearances for the Lanarkshire side. He was sent off for his role in a tunnel brawl after a win over Heart of Midlothian, having been an unused substitute during the game. Knight was later released by Hamilton on 14 January 2010. The next day, Knight joined Dumfries club Queen of the South until the end of the season. He made his debut in a 1\\u20131 draw with Dundee on 23 January. He was released at the end of the 2009\\u201310 season, having made six league appearances for the club. In September 2010, Knight was set to return to English football with Conference side Darlington after a successful trial, but his transfer was blocked by previous club Rushden, who had held onto his registration and demanded \\u00a330,000 for the deal to be completed. Knight responded by criticising Rushden &amp; Diamonds on his Twitter account, saying that he has chosen not to buy-out his contract as a matter of principle. \\\"Rushden have said they don't want the money from Darlington, they want it from me \\u2013 I refuse to pay them out of principle. If I wanted I could raise the money and pay them but I don't want to give them the satisfaction.\\\"</p>\\n<p>The following month, Knight elected to continue his career outside of England by signing for Northern Irish side Coleraine. He scored twice on his debut in a 2\\u20131 win away to Glenavon on 16 October 2010. He agreed an 18-month contract extension with the club in January 2011, and finished the 2010\\u201311 season with 14 league goals from 23 matches. In June, he went on trial with Swindon Town, but was released after two days because of insufficient fitness levels. \\\"He's not the player for us. It's not his fault, we tried, but his fitness at the moment is not good,\\\" said Swindon manager Paolo Di Canio. \\\"We are not in a position where we can wait for a player to be fit, we need a player to be ready and fit in the next two weeks, to compete and challenge during the season.\\\" Two weeks later, Knight was transfer-listed and suspended by Coleraine for failing to appear for training and matches. He also breached club rules by stating his desire to return to England and play for another IFA Premiership club. However, a fortnight later, Knight signed a new two-year contract with the club. \\\"I said things about wanting to leave and at the time I felt it was right for me, but things change,\\\" he said. \\\"I've spoken at great length with the manager over the last three or four days and I came back to him wanting to work something out. Agreeing a new two-year deal shows my commitment to the club and that I'm eager to put the last few weeks behind me.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In January 2012 however, Coleraine asked Knight to either live in Northern Ireland or pay his own travel costs, as he was still living in London and had to travel over to Northern Ireland for each game, which was costing Coleraine \\u00a31,000\\u2013\\u00a31,500 per month. An agreement could not be reached, and Knight joined Glentoran on 30 January 2012. His stay at Glentoran was relatively short lived, as the club released him in June 2012 when they invoked a probationary clause in his contract after he allegedly made homophobic comments on Twitter.</p>\\n<p>On 21 August 2014, Knight sign for North West Countries League, Division One side Barnton AFC. </p>\\n<h2>International career</h2>\\n<p>Knight has played for England at under 19 and under 20 level.</p>\\n<h2>Personal life</h2>\\n<p>Knight was born in Hackney, London, to a Jamaican mother and St. Lucian father, and was educated at Raine's Foundation School, Bethnal Green, He has three sisters, and is the cousin of Bolton Wanderers defender Zat Knight.

Davis later stated that the streaking incident affected O'Sullivan's concentration and momentum, allowing him back into the match. The afternoon session ended all-square at 4\\u20134. O'Sullivan began the evening session by winning four frames in 49 minutes to take an 8\\u20134 lead, but Davis fought back to win the next six frames and clinch the title with a 10\\u20138 victory. On 21 April 1997, while playing Mick Price in the first round of the World Championship, O'Sullivan made the fastest ever competitive maximum break in 5 minutes 20 seconds, an average of one shot every 8.8 seconds. This was also O'Sullivan's first maximum break in professional competition. He exited the World Championship in the second round, losing 12\\u201313 against Darren Morgan.</p>\\n<p>In the 1997/1998 season O'Sullivan won his second UK Championship title by defeating Hendry 10\\u20136 in the final. In February he reached the quarter-final of the Masters, but lost 3\\u20136 to Davis. Later that month he won the Scottish Open by defeating John Higgins 9\\u20135 in the final. The following month he defeated Ken Doherty in the final of the Irish Masters, but was disqualified after a post-match drug test found cannabis in his system. The title was subsequently awarded to Doherty. O'Sullivan reached a second World Championship semi-final, but lost 9\\u201317 against Higgins.</p>\\n<h3>1998/1999\\u20132000/2001</h3>\\n<p>In the 1998/1999 season O'Sullivan did not defend his UK Championship title. He withdrew from the tournament shortly before his scheduled first-round match, with his manager stating that he was suffering from physical and nervous exhaustion and that doctors had ordered him to rest. Other reports stated that O'Sullivan was suffering from depression. He reached the quarter-finals of the Masters, but lost 2\\u20136 to Doherty. At the World Championship, he reached his third semi-final in four years, but was again denied a place in the final when he lost 13\\u201317 to Hendry. During the match, the players made a total of eight century breaks, four from Hendry and four from O'Sullivan. When Hendry made back-to-back centuries of 101 and 108 in the 21st and 22nd frames, O'Sullivan responded with 134 in the 23rd frame, narrowly missing out on a maximum break when he missed the pink into the middle pocket. O'Sullivan went on to make a 110 break in the 24th frame, the fourth consecutive frame won with a century.</p>\\n<p>In the 1999/2000 season O'Sullivan won two ranking tournaments, the China Open, where he defeated Stephen Lee 9\\u20132 in the final, and the Scottish Open, where he defeated Mark Williams 9\\u20131 in the final. For the third year in succession he was eliminated from the Masters at the quarter-final stage, losing 3\\u20136 to Parrott. At the World Championship O'Sullivan was eliminated in the first round, losing 9\\u201310 to David Gray, despite becoming the first player to compile five century breaks in a best-of-19-frame match.</p>\\n<p>During the 2000/2001 season O'Sullivan won six tournaments, and reached the final of one further event. He won the Champions Cup by defeating Mark Williams 7\\u20135 in the final, and reached the final of the Grand Prix, but lost the final 5\\u20139 against Williams. He successfully defended his China Open title by defeating Williams 9\\u20133 in the final. He won the Irish Masters defeating Stephen Hendry 9\\u20138 in the final, and went on to claim his first World Championship title with an 18\\u201314 victory over John Higgins. O'Sullivan dedicated this win to his father. He ended the season by winning the Premier League. After finishing second in the league stage, he defeated Higgins 6\\u20133 in the semi-finals, and Hendry 9\\u20137 in the final.</p>\\n<h3>2001/2002\\u20132003/2004</h3>\\n<p>In the 2001/2002 season, O'Sullivan won his third UK title, with a 10\\u20131 victory over Doherty. At the 2002 World Championship, before meeting Hendry in the semi-finals, O'Sullivan said during a pre-match interview: \\\"I know if I do get beat and he comes up and does a moonie in front of me and goes 'Ne ne ne', I'll just look at him and say 'well done' and say 'go back to your sad little life'.\\\", referring to a previous match against Hendry in 1999. In the match, O'Sullivan opened up an 8\\u20135 overnight lead, but Hendry rallied on the second day to level at 12\\u201312 before the final session. Hendry subsequently outplayed O'Sullivan, and won by 17 frames to 13. After the match, O'Sullivan accused Hendry of poor sportsmanship, referring to his conduct over a \\\"miss\\\" shot at an unnamed prior tournament. Hendry did not comment on his opponent's outbursts, but O'Sullivan did receive criticism for his remarks from Steve Davis, Dennis Taylor and Clive Everton, and he later apologised to Hendry for his comments. O'Sullivan ended the season by defending his Premier League title. Having finished first after the league stage, O'Sullivan defeated Jimmy White 6\\u20132 in the semi-final, and John Higgins 9\\u20134 in the final. He began the 2002/2003 season ranked number 1.</p>\\n<p>O'Sullivan had another successful season in 2002/2003, reaching the last 16 in seven ranking tournaments. He began the season by winning the invitational Scottish Masters, defeating John Higgins 9\\u20134 in the final. He reached the quarter-finals of the LG Cup, losing against eventual champion Chris Small; the last 16 of the British Open, losing against Paul Hunter, the quarter-finals of the UK Championship, losing against Drew Henry; and the quarter-finals of the Welsh Open, losing against Marco Fu. After this O'Sullivan won back-to-back ranking titles, defeating Hendry in the final of the European Open, and Higgins in the final of the Irish Masters. He reached the last 16 of the Scottish Open, before losing against Ken Doherty. His only first-round ranking event defeat of the season came at the World Championship, when he lost 6\\u201310 in the first round against the unseeded Marco Fu, despite making a maximum break in the match. This defeat saw him drop to number 3 in the rankings. He participated at the Premier League, but despite topping the table after the league stage, he lost 4\\u20136 in the semi-final against Fu.</p>\\n<p>In the 2003/2004 season, O'Sullivan reached three ranking-event finals. He reached the final of the British Open, but lost 6\\u20139 against Stephen Hendry. He won the Welsh Open by defeating Steve Davis 9\\u20138. He reached the final of the Masters, but lost 9\\u201310 against Paul Hunter, despite having led 6\\u20131 and then 9\\u20137. In 2004, O'Sullivan's father telephoned six-time World Champion Ray Reardon, and asked if he could give O'Sullivan some advice. With Reardon's help O'Sullivan recovered his form, and won the 2004 World Championship. He defeated Hendry 17\\u20134 in the semi\\u2013finals, the most one-sided defeat ever in a World Championship semi\\u2013final. He then defeated Graeme Dott 18\\u20138 in the final, despite losing the first five frames. O'Sullivan blamed his poor start on \\\"mind games\\\" by Dott's coach Derek Hill, who visited O'Sullivan's dressing room just before the match. O'Sullivan was ranked number one for the next two seasons.</p>\\n<h3>2004/2005</h3>\\n<p>O'Sullivan began the 2004/2005 season by winning the Grand Prix, defeating Ian McCulloch 9\\u20135 in the final. He then reached the semi-finals of the British Open, losing 1\\u20136 to Stephen Maguire, and the last 32 of the UK Championship, losing 6\\u20139, once again against Maguire. In 2005, O'Sullivan defended his Welsh Open title, by defeating Stephen Hendry 9\\u20138. During the tournament, O'Sullivan compiled ten century breaks, including a break of 146, the highest of the tournament. After this, he won his second Masters title, by defeating John Higgins 10\\u20133. After the final, Higgins described O'Sullivan as a \\\"total genius\\\".</p>\\n<p>O'Sullivan then won his third Irish Masters title, by defeating Matthew Stevens 10\\u20138. He then missed the China Open on medical grounds; for which he was criticised by Anthony Hamilton, who said that O'Sullivan has a duty to promote the sport overseas. In the World Championship, O'Sullivan lost to Peter Ebdon in the quarter-final. From 2\\u20138 down, Ebdon began a comeback and eventually won 13\\u201311, by playing in an exceptionally determined and dogged style, with many observers accusing him of deliberate slow play to disrupt O'Sullivan's fast game. After the match, O'Sullivan indicated to the press that he was unlikely to compete in the following season, and would perhaps even retire from the sport altogether. O'Sullivan participated in the Premier League. After finishing third in the table after the league stage, O'Sullivan defeated Hendry 5\\u20130 in the semi-finals, and Williams 6\\u20130 in the final. In September 2005, he announced that he would play a truncated 2005/2006 season, spending some time playing eight-ball pool in the United States, having been chosen to compete on the elite International Pool Tour.</p>\\n<h3>2005/2006</h3>\\n<p>O'Sullivan began the 2005/2006 season at the Grand Prix, and reached the final, but lost 2\\u20139 against John Higgins. In his last 32 match with Mark King at the UK Championship, O'Sullivan sat with a wet towel draped over his head for most of the contest, and lost 8\\u20139. He then successfully defended his Premier League title. Having finished first in the league stage, he defeated Steve Davis 5\\u20133 in the semi-finals, and Stephen Hendry 6\\u20130 in the final. O'Sullivan then reached the final of the Masters, but lost 9\\u201310 against Higgins. O'Sullivan skipped the Malta Cup, and then lost his opening matches at the next two ranking events, as he lost 1\\u20135 against Ian McCulloch at the Welsh Open and 0\\u20135 against James Wattana at the China Open.</p>\\n<p>The 2006 World Championship began with O'Sullivan defeating Dave Harold 10\\u20134, followed by a struggle through to a 13\\u201310 win in his second-round match against Welshman Ryan Day. A similar quarter-final match ensued against Mark Williams. O'Sullivan led 10\\u20136 going into the final session. A fightback from Williams saw him take the lead by winning the next five frames; but O'Sullivan held his nerve to take the match 13\\u201311, and faced Graeme Dott in the semi\\u2013finals. Dott took an early lead before O'Sullivan drew level at 8\\u20138 at the end of the second session. Cue-tip problems, which had dogged O'Sullivan throughout the event, recurred, including an incident in which television footage appeared to show O'Sullivan deliberately removing the tip of his cue. This secured him a 15-minute break to re-tip the cue, before he returned and made a 124 break. Tournament Director Mike Ganley accepted the player's assurance that the tip had simply fallen off, and no censure was made. The incident drew criticism from his opponent, and from Steve Davis and John Parrott. Dott then took all eight frames of the third session, leaving himself one frame away from his second final in three years. The final session saw O'Sullivan stage a minor fightback, taking three frames in a row, before a mistake let Dott back in for an eventual clearance on the black. After Dott's win, O'Sullivan gave his cue and case to a boy in the crowd. BBC claims he had used as many as 21 different tips during the fortnight; O'Sullivan later stated that he had used seven tips before arriving in Sheffield, and a further eight during the week, and that he would return next season with a new cue. O'Sullivan's decision not to enter the Malta Cup cost him the number-one rank for the following season.</p>\\n<h3>2006/2007</h3>\\n<p>On his way to the final of the Northern Ireland Trophy, which he lost 6\\u20139 to Ding Junhui, he defeated semi\\u2013final opponent Dominic Dale 6\\u20130, in only 53 minutes \\u2013 a record for a best of 11 frame match. O'Sullivan then reached the quarter-finals of the Grand Prix, but lost 1\\u20135 against eventual champion Neil Robertson. In December 2006, in his quarter-final match of the UK Championship against Hendry, O'Sullivan conceded in dramatic fashion part-way into the sixth frame of the best of 17 match. He had gone 0\\u20134 down after a strong start from Hendry, before finally taking a frame back. At the beginning of the sixth frame, O'Sullivan opened with a break of 24, before leaving himself a difficult shot from black to red. After missing the red, he calmly shook the hand of both Hendry (saying to him that he \\\"had enough of it, mate\\\") and the match referee, Jan Verhaas, and walked out of the arena, stunning everyone present. The incident caused minor disruption to the other quarter-final match, between Graeme Dott and Steve Davis, being played simultaneously in the same arena. Dott later said that he initially thought that O'Sullivan and Hendry were having a fight when he heard an audience member shout \\\"Get a grip, Ronnie\\\". It was later officially confirmed that O'Sullivan had forfeited the match, which was awarded 9\\u20131 to Hendry. O\\u2019Sullivan issued a statement later that day, apologising and saying that he would be \\\"back on his feet fighting stronger and harder than ever very soon\\\". On 31 May 2007, World Snooker fined him a total of \\u00a320,800 over this incident, and docked him 900 ranking points.</p>\\n<p>O'Sullivan returned to action at the Masters, to a mixed response from the audience (being both booed and clapped). He won his first round match 6\\u20131 on 16 January 2007, against Ali Carter, making two century breaks in the process. However, he then created more controversy by failing to attend a post-match press conference. He did record a short interview with Steve Davis for the BBC, stating that he was much happier than at the UK Championship, and that he was playing well once again. Sir Rodney Walker later issued a statement declaring that O'Sullivan had been excused from dealing with the media because of the exceptional circumstances affecting him. This decision was criticised by Shaun Murphy, and Ken Doherty. O'Sullivan went on to win the tournament against Ding Junhui, on 21 January 2007. In the match, he was noted for his good sportsmanship by Steve Davis, specifically for comforting Ding after the twelfth frame, during which Ding had become visibly upset by an overly partisan member of the crowd, who was later ejected. O'Sullivan was leading 9\\u20133 at the time, and won the next frame for a 10\\u20133 victory.</p>\\n<p>O'Sullivan went out of the Malta Cup with a 3\\u20135 loss to Michael Holt in the first round. He reached the quarter-finals of the Welsh Open, but lost 4\\u20135 against Neil Robertson. In his quarter-final match against Joe Swail at the Irish Masters, O'Sullivan compiled a maximum break on his way to a narrow 5\\u20134 victory, the second 147 in any professional competition in Ireland. The initial maximum break prize of a Citro\\u00ebn Coupe, worth \\u20ac20,000, was later withdrawn by the organisers. He then defeated John Higgins 6\\u20135 in the semi-finals and won the title by defeating Barry Hawkins 9\\u20131 in the final. O'Sullivan then reached the semi-finals of the China Open, but lost 2\\u20136 against eventual champion Graeme Dott. Just before the World Championship, in which he was to play a first-round match with Ding Junhui again, O'Sullivan claimed that the draw was fixed. This was subsequently denied by World Snooker, and O'Sullivan later retracted his accusation. In the end O'Sullivan won the tie easily by 10 frames to 2. He also won his second-round match against Robertson 13\\u201310 (despite losing six frames in a row at one point), before losing his quarter-final match 9\\u201313 against eventual champion John Higgins.</p>\\n<h3>2007/2008</h3>\\n<p>O'Sullivan withdrew from the first ranking event of the season, the Shanghai Masters, citing back problems for which doctors had advised him not to travel. He also chose not to enter the invitational Pot Black tournament. He made the final of the Grand Prix, but lost 6\\u20139 against Marco Fu. During the Northern Ireland Trophy, he set a new record, by compiling five centuries in a 5\\u20132 win over Ali Carter. This also included his seventh official competitive 147 maximum break. O'Sullivan went out of the tournament in the next round, having lost against Fergal O'Brien. On 2 December 2007, he won a fourth consecutive, and record seventh total, Premier League Snooker title, by beating John Higgins in the final by a score of 7\\u20134. On 15 December 2007, O'Sullivan compiled his eighth maximum break in competition, in the deciding frame of his UK Championship semi\\u2013final against Mark Selby at Telford, equalling Hendry's record. In doing so, he also became only the third person in professional competition to compile a maximum to win a match. Hendry had made the first against O'Sullivan in the 1997 Charity Challenge final, and Mark Williams had made the second, at the Crucible in the first round of the 2005 World Championship. O'Sullivan is also the second player after John Higgins to make 147 breaks in two consecutive ranking tournaments (2007 Northern Ireland Trophy and 2007 Maplin UK Championship). He then went on to win the tournament, beating Stephen Maguire 10\\u20132 in the final (from 8\\u20130 up), thereby receiving a \\u00a3100,000 cheque for winning his first ranking tournament in almost three years.</p>\\n<p>At the Masters on 12 January, Stephen Maguire edged out O'Sullivan in a final frame, to win their first-round match at Wembley. In the battle of the top two players in the provisional world rankings, O'Sullivan fought back from 1\\u20134 down to level at 5\\u20135 and take the match into a deciding eleventh frame. O'Sullivan missed the final blue with the rest, when poised to win the match, allowing Maguire to reach the quarter-finals. After withdrawing from the invitational Malta Cup, O'Sullivan returned at the Welsh Open in February. Playing a good tournament, he reached the final. Although he led 8\\u20135, Selby won the last four frames to beat him 9\\u20138. O'Sullivan was present at the China Open, in Beijing, where he lost 4\\u20135 to Marco Fu in the first round. However, at the press conference, which followed the match, O'Sullivan was heard making some lewd remarks inviting a member of the press to perform fellatio on him, then laughing with the World Snooker media spokesman. O'Sullivan also joked about the size and girth of his penis, before simulating a sexual act on his microphone. In June 2008, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association punished him for his behaviour by docking the appearance-money and world-ranking points that he had earned from the event.</p>\\n<p>At the 2008 World Championships, O'Sullivan compiled a record-breaking ninth competitive maximum break against Mark Williams. It was his third of the season, and also his third maximum at the Crucible. It was the fourth maximum to be compiled in a winning frame of a match (following those of Hendry, Williams, and O'Sullivan himself). Interviewed by Steve Davis just after beating Williams 13\\u20137, he said \\\"I can finally buy a Bentley Continental GT\\\". Soon after potting the final black, snooker legend and commentator Dennis Taylor labelled O'Sullivan as a \\\"total genius\\\". However, O'Sullivan's 147 was equalled by Ali Carter in the same tournament, thus halving the prize-money. O'Sullivan defeated Liu Chuang, Mark Williams, Liang Wenbo and Stephen Hendry en route to the final of the tournament. After the match Hendry described O'Sullivan as \\\"the best in the world by a country mile\\\". He then beat Carter 18\\u20138 for the title on 5 May. In an interview after his third world-title win, he hinted again that he may not play in the 2008/2009 season, but also stated that he might go on to pursue many more world titles. At the end of the season, O'Sullivan left management company 110sport to join the Romford-based Grove Leisure.</p>\\n<h3>2008/2009</h3>\\n<p>O'Sullivan began the 2008/2009 season by winning the Northern Ireland Trophy, defeating Dave Harold 9\\u20133 in the final. O'Sullivan is the only player to win back-to-back ranking events in the last four years. He then reached the final of the Shanghai Masters, having defeated Stephen Maguire in the semi\\u2013finals with two the top breaks of 141 and 145. However, in the final, he was defeated by qualifier Ricky Walden, 10\\u20138. O'Sullivan was leading, but Walden pulled back four frames in a row to win the match. In the Premier League, he secured a 7\\u20132 win over Mark Selby, which meant that he had won the event eight times in total, and five times consecutively. However, O'Sullivan failed to defend his UK Championship title, losing to Joe Perry 5\\u20139 in the second round. O'Sullivan had conceded the twelfth game of the match to go 5\\u20137 down, although Perry held a lead of only 23 points to zero. Commenting afterwards, O'Sullivan said \\\"It might have looked like I lost my head or whatever, but I'm sure I'll bounce back.\\\" For this he was later fined \\u00a3300, and was ordered to pay \\u00a31,000 in costs.</p>\\n<p>In the Masters, O'Sullivan reached the final by beating Joe Perry, Ali Carter and Stephen Maguire. In a tense final against defending champion Mark Selby, neither player was able to obtain a sizeable lead, with frames littered with both big breaks and close finishes. After leading 3\\u20131, O'Sullivan ended the afternoon session at 4\\u20134, and took the first frame of the evening session. Selby, however, then won the next 3 frames to lead 7\\u20135. O'Sullivan responded by taking three frames in succession himself, to lead 8\\u20137. The following two frames were shared, and at 9\\u20138, after both players had wasted chances, O'Sullivan constructed a break of 55, beating Mark Selby 10\\u20138 and thereby claiming the title for the fourth time. In doing this, he became only the second player, after Stephen Hendry, to win the trophy more than three times. In his post-match interview, O'Sullivan proclaimed his victory, composed with a cue that he had obtained only the previous Saturday, as his greatest achievement in snooker. During an exhibition in Ireland in January 2009, O'Sullivan and Jimmy White made maximum breaks in consecutive frames. In the first round of 2009 World Championship O'Sullivan compiled three centuries in his 10\\u20135 win against Stuart Bingham. O'Sullivan compiled a 140 break in the second, a 104 in the eighth, and a 103 in the 14th. He was defeated in the second round 11\\u201313, by Mark Allen, after having led 9\\u20137.</p>\\n<h3>2009/2010</h3>\\n<p>He began the season by winning the Shanghai Masters, defeating Liang Wenbo 10\\u20135 in the final. On the way to reaching the final, he lost only 6 frames. He beat Graeme Dott 5\\u20130 in the first round, Marco Fu 5\\u20132 in the second round, Ding Junhui 5\\u20133 in the quarter-finals, and John Higgins 6\\u20131 in the semi\\u2013finals. After his Shanghai Masters victory, he joined the newly founded Snooker Players Association. In the second ranking event, the Grand Prix, he beat Jamie Burnett 5\\u20133 in the first round, but then lost narrowly against John Higgins in the second round, by 4\\u20135. On 29 November 2009, O'Sullivan did not retain his Premier League Snooker title, with Shaun Murphy defeating him 7\\u20133 in the final. Following his 9\\u20133 victory over Matthew Stevens in the first round of the UK Championship on 7 December 2009, O'Sullivan caused controversy in his post-match press conference. He described the outgoing regime at the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (headed by Sir Rodney Walker) as \\\"a cancer running through the game\\\" and also said, \\\"Leukaemia has set in\\\". He went on to endorse the new era of snooker, headed by Barry Hearn. He then won his next two matches, 9\\u20133 against Peter Ebdon in the last 16, and Mark Selby in the quarter-finals, before losing the semi\\u2013final 8\\u20139 to John Higgins, despite having come back from 2\\u20138 to 8\\u20138.</p>\\n<p>O'Sullivan began the defence of his Masters title by defeating Australian Neil Robertson 6\\u20134 in the first round, after having trailed 0\\u20133. After this, he defeated Peter Ebdon 6\\u20133 in the quarter-final. In the semi-final, he beat Mark Williams 6\\u20135, to reach his 6th Masters final in 7 years. O'Sullivan met Mark Selby in the final for the second consecutive year, and lost 9\\u201310 despite having led 9\\u20136. In the Welsh Open, he reached the semi\\u2013finals by beating Stuart Bingham 5\\u20131 in the first round, Jamie Cope 5\\u20130 in the second round, and Mark Allen 5\\u20132 in the quarter-finals, but lost 4\\u20136 against John Higgins in the semi\\u2013finals. O'Sullivan lost 3\\u20135 in the first round of the China Open, against 22-year-old wild card Tian Pengfei. In the eighth frame, O'Sullivan made a mistake on the final black, and the ball finished over the pocket. He immediately conceded frame and match. With this, he also lost his chance to defend his official World No. 1 spot. At the World Championship, he defeated Liang Wenbo 10\\u20137 in the first round and Mark Williams 13\\u201310 in the second round, before losing 11\\u201313 to Mark Selby in the quarter-finals.</p>\\n<h3>2010/2011</h3>\\n<p>O'Sullivan began the 2010/2011 season at Event 1 of the Players Tour Championship, where he lost in the quarter-finals against Jamie Cope, 0\\u20134. O'Sullivan next competed at Event 4, where reached the final, but he lost 3\\u20134 against Barry Pinches. At the World Open O'Sullivan made his record 10th maximum break in the last frame of his match against Mark King, which he won 3\\u20130. However, he had to be persuaded by referee Jan Verhaas to play the final black, as he had become aware that there was no distinct prize money for a maximum break in the tournament, but only a prize of \\u00a34,000 for the highest break. Even then, he played the final black in a nonchalant fashion. O'Sullivan then defeated Jimmy White (3\\u20131), Stephen Hendry (3\\u20131), Stephen Maguire (3\\u20131) and Peter Ebdon (3\\u20131) to reach the final, where he lost 1\\u20135 against Neil Robertson. O'Sullivan participated at the Premier League Snooker, and qualified for the finals unbeaten. He then defeated Neil Robertson 5\\u20131 in the semi-finals, and Shaun Murphy 7\\u20131 in the final, to claim his ninth Premier League Snooker title in 14 years. In the UK Championship in December, O'Sullivan suffered an early exit, losing 6\\u20139 against Stuart Bingham in the first round.</p>\\n<p>At the Masters in January, O'Sullivan went out 4\\u20136 in the first round against Mark Allen. O'Sullivan reached the semi-finals in the Snooker Shoot-Out in January 2011, before losing against Robert Milkins. He made the two highest breaks of the tournament, 112 and 123. He then lost in the first round of the next two ranking tournaments, both times against Ryan Day. He lost 2\\u20134 at the Welsh Open, and 2\\u20135 at the China Open. He reached the quarter-finals of the World Championship by defeating Dominic Dale 10\\u20132 in the first round and Shaun Murphy 13\\u201310 in the second round, but lost 10\\u201313 against John Higgins.</p>\\n<h3>2011/2012</h3>\\n<p>O'Sullivan began the 2011/2012 season at Event 1 of the Players Tour Championship, where he won 4\\u20130 in the final against Joe Perry. At the Paul Hunter Classic, he made the 11th official maximum break of his career, and set a new record of career maximum breaks. He reached the semi-finals, but lost 3\\u20134 against Mark Selby. His next tournament was the Shanghai Masters, where he reached the second round, but lost 3\\u20135 against Anthony Hamilton. In October 2011 he won the Kay Suzanne Memorial Trophy, by defeating Matthew Stevens 4\\u20132 in the final. In November 2011 he reached the final of the Antwerp Open, but lost 3\\u20134 against Judd Trump. After 12 of 12 events, O'Sullivan was ranked number two on the Order of Merit, and qualified for the Finals, but withdrew due to medical reasons.</p>\\n\\n<p>O'Sullivan won the 10th Premier League title of his career. After topping the table in the league stage, he defeated Mark Williams to reach the final, where he defeated Ding Junhui 7\\u20131. His next tournament was the UK Championship, where he lost in the second round 5\\u20136 against eventual champion Judd Trump. At the Masters, he again lost against Trump, this time 2\\u20136 in the quarter-finals. At the German Masters, he reached his first ranking final since the 2010 World Open, and won 9\\u20137 against Stephen Maguire, despite having trailed 0\\u20134 against Andrew Higginson in the first round. He then reached the semi-finals of the Welsh Open, and the quarter-finals of the China Open, but lost 2\\u20136 against Mark Selby and 4\\u20135 against Maguire.</p>\\n<p>At the World Championship O'Sullivan saw off former world champions in each of his first three matches. He beat Peter Ebdon 10\\u20134 in the first round, Mark Williams 13\\u20136 in the second, and Neil Robertson 13\\u201310 in the quarter-finals. He beat two-time runner-up Matthew Stevens 17\\u201310 in the semi-finals, and defeated Ali Carter 18\\u201311 in the final, to win his fourth world title. Aged 36, and just 40 days older than Dennis Taylor was when he won the title in 1985, O'Sullivan became the oldest world champion since 45-year-old Ray Reardon in 1978. In the eighth frame of the final, O'Sullivan made a break of 141, the highest break ever recorded in a Crucible final. He was ranked world number nine at the end of the season. On 10 May 2012, O'Sullivan was named as the World Snooker Player of the Year and the Snooker Writers Player of the Year. He was also inducted into the Hall of Fame, along with Walter Donaldson, Mark Williams and John Higgins.</p>\\n<h3>2012/2013</h3>\\n\\n<p>On 6 June the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association released a statement announcing that O'Sullivan had not signed the official players' contract and would therefore not be eligible to play in any 2012/2013 World Snooker event until he did so. On the same day O'Sullivan said that he found the contract \\\"too onerous\\\" and that he was in a stage of his career where he did not wish to make the commitment. On 7 August it was announced that he had now signed the contract and would be playing in October's International Championship and December's UK Championship. O'Sullivan returned to action at the third UK event of the Players Tour Championship in September, where he lost 3\\u20134 to Simon Bedford after leading 3\\u20132. After the Shanghai Masters he dropped out of the top sixteen for the first time since entering it in the 1994/1995 season, as he was ranked world number 17. O'Sullivan's return to snooker was short-lived, as he withdrew from the inaugural International Championship due to advice from his doctor not to travel. On 6 November O'Sullivan announced that he had withdrawn from every event he had entered and that he would not play for the remainder of the season. However, on 26 February O'Sullivan announced during a press conference that he would return to the game and defend his World Championship title.</p>\\n<p>At the Crucible O'Sullivan defeated Marcus Campbell in the last 32, Ali Carter in the last 16, Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals, and Judd Trump in the semi-finals. He reached the final without falling behind even once, and defeated Barry Hawkins 18\\u201312 to win his fifth world title. O'Sullivan's break of 103 in the 15th frame was his 128th century break at the Crucible Theatre, breaking Stephen Hendry's record of 127 Crucible centuries. During the final he extended the record to 131 century breaks. O'Sullivan became the only player to score six century breaks in a World Championship final. He also became only the third player to retain his title at the Crucible after Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry.</p>\\n<p>On 1 May 2013, O'Sullivan announced that his return to the Crucible would be short-lived, and that he would not compete in future World Championships. However, after his title win, O'Sullivan refused definitively to rule out a title defence in 2014, saying in a post-match interview that \\\"I just love playing, so I will definitely be playing in some smaller events, and we will just see what goes on.\\\"</p>\\n<h3>2013/2014</h3>\\n\\n<p>O'Sullivan started the 2013/2014 season ranked number 19. For personal reasons, he pulled out of the first ranking tournament of the season, the Wuxi Classic, shortly before he was due to face Michael Wasley in the qualifying round. In June 2013 he competed in the Bulgarian Open, his first tournament appearance outside England in 15 months, but lost 2\\u20134 against John Higgins in the semi-finals. In August 2013 he announced that his tournament schedule for the remainder of the season would include the UK Championship, the German Masters, the Masters, and the Welsh Open, as well as returning to the Crucible in 2014 to defend his World Championship title. In the same month he suffered a surprise 1\\u20134 defeat against Peter Lines in the last 32 of the Bluebell Wood Open, but went on to win the Paul Hunter Classic by defeating Gerard Greene 4\\u20130 in the final. O'Sullivan then qualified for the International Championship by defeating Joel Walker 6\\u20131 in the qualifying round, and defeated Anthony McGill 6\\u20132 at the venue, before losing 4\\u20136 against Liang Wenbo in the last 32. After that O'Sullivan reached the final of the Antwerp Open, but lost 3\\u20134 against Mark Selby, despite leading 3\\u20131. In the Champion of Champions he defeated Ding Junhui and Neil Robertson in final frame deciders and went on to win the title by defeating Stuart Bingham 10\\u20138 in the final. He reached the quarter-finals of the UK Championship, but lost 4\\u20136 against Bingham, despite making breaks of 135 and 127 in the match.</p>\\n\\n<p>At the Masters, O'Sullivan defeated Robert Milkins 6\\u20131 in the first round, before he whitewashed Ricky Walden 6\\u20130 in the quarter-finals, a match that lasted just 57 minutes and 48 seconds. During the match he scored 556 points without reply, a new record in a professional event, beating the previous record of 495 points set by Ding Junhui at the 2007 Premier League Snooker. He defeated Stephen Maguire 6\\u20132 in the semi-finals to reach a record tenth Masters final, surpassing the nine appearances by Stephen Hendry. Facing defending champion Mark Selby in the final, he took a 7\\u20131 lead in the first session, before going on to a 10\\u20134 victory for his fifth Masters title. On 22 January 2014, the Disciplinary Committee of the WPBSA issued a statement that O'Sullivan had been found in breach of the association's Members Rules. It fined him \\u00a36,000 and ordered him to pay \\u00a31,000 in costs over three posts on his personal Twitter account, made in September and October 2013, that it deemed damaging to the image of the sport. The first post related to match-fixing allegations, the second to a suggestion that he had used performance-enhancing drugs, and the third to a tweet that was described as \\\"offensive\\\". The committee fined him an additional \\u00a31,000 for making \\\"abusive, insulting and disrespectful\\\" comments to referee Jan Verhaas during the December 2013 qualifying round for the German Masters. The incident arose after Verhaas asked O'Sullivan to tuck his shirt in during the match. O'Sullivan apologised for his conduct with the referee, stating that he felt unwell on the day and that the venue was overly warm.</p>\\n<p>At the Welsh Open, O'Sullivan defeated Ricky Walden 4\\u20131 in the last 16, John Higgins 5\\u20131 in the quarter-finals, and Barry Hawkins 6\\u20132 in the semi-finals. He defeated Ding Junhui 9\\u20133 in the final to win his third Welsh Open title, and the 26th ranking title of his career. In the last frame of the final, he compiled a record 12th maximum break in professional competition, breaking the previous record of 11 maximum breaks that he had held jointly with Stephen Hendry. During the season O'Sullivan competed at the Players Tour Championship, and finished second on the European Tour Order of Merit, to qualify for the Players Championship Grand Final. There he defeated Scott Donaldson 4\\u20130 in the last 32, but lost 3\\u20134 against Yu Delu in the last 16, despite making a 140, the highest break of the tournament.</p>\\n<p>At the World Championship, O'Sullivan began his title defence by beating Robin Hull 10\\u20134 in the first round. Playing Joe Perry in the second round, O'Sullivan was behind for the first two sessions, but recovered to win the match 13\\u201311. Up against Shaun Murphy in the 16th World Championship quarter-final of his career, O'Sullivan took 13 of the last 14 frames to win the match 13\\u20133, with a session to spare. He defeated Barry Hawkins 17\\u20137 in the semi-finals, also with a session to spare, to reach his sixth World Championship final. Facing Mark Selby in the final, O'Sullivan began strongly, taking a 10\\u20135 lead, but lost 10 of the next 12 frames to trail 12\\u201315. He went on to lose 14\\u201318, his first ever defeat in a World Championship final. At around 1:30\\u00a0a.m., on their way home from the final, O'Sullivan and his six-year-old son were involved in a car crash on the M1 motorway near Leicester, after the sports car O'Sullivan was driving hit a patch of standing water and collided with the central reservation. Neither O'Sullivan nor his son were injured. After the World Championship, a new ranking system took effect, based on a two-year rolling prize money list rather than ranking points. This meant that O'Sullivan ended the season ranked number 4.</p>\\n<h3>2014/2015</h3>\\n<p>O'Sullivan started the 2014/2015 season at the Paul Hunter Classic, but lost 2\\u20134 against Tian Pengfei in the last 16. His first ranking event was the Shanghai Masters, where he lost 3\\u20135 against Alan McManus. Ronnie O'Sullivan then competed in the International Championship, cited as the biggest event in Asia, in Chengdu after beating James Cahill to qualify. Having battled to beat Ben Woollaston, 6-4, in his opening match of the tournament, Ronnie sailed past his next two opponents of McGill and Li Hang 6-1. This set up a meeting with Mark Williams, a man who hadn't beat O'Sullivan for 12 years, in the quarters; however, after falling 3-0 behind, Williams won the next 5 frames and eventually the match, 6-5. O'Sullivan next competed in the Champion of Champions where he was defending champion. O'Sullivan begun his defence with a 4-2 defeat of Stuart Bingham. He then went on to whitewash Marco Fu 6-0 to reach the semi-final. In the semi-final, O'Sullivan defeated Ding Junhui 6-4 and then went on to defeat Judd Trump in a high-scoring final, 10-7; making four century breaks and eleven breaks over fifty during the match.</p>\\n<h2>Playing style</h2>\\n<p>O'Sullivan plays in a fast and attacking manner. He is a prolific <dfn id=\\\"\\\">breakbuilder</dfn> and solid tactical player. He has stated his disdain for long, drawn-out games, saying that it harms the game of snooker. He is regarded as an excellent front-runner; by many other professionals. In previous years, he could become demoralized by being behind and not playing well, and was liable to lose several consecutive frames. He is right-handed but can play to a very high standard with his left hand and routinely alternates where needed. While not quite possessing the same power in his left arm, being ambidextrous enables him to attempt shots with his left hand that would otherwise require awkward cueing with a <dfn id=\\\"\\\">rest</dfn> or <dfn id=\\\"\\\">spider</dfn>.</p>\\n<p>When he first displayed this left-handed ability in the 1996 World Championship against Alain Robidoux, the Canadian accused him of disrespect. O'Sullivan responded that he played better with his left hand than Robidoux could with his right. He was summoned to a disciplinary hearing in response to Robidoux's formal complaint, where he had to prove that he could play to a high level with his left hand. He played three frames of snooker against former world championship runner-up Rex Williams, winning all three. The charge of bringing the game into disrepute was subsequently dropped.</p>\\n<h2>Status</h2>\\n<p>He is considered by many to be the most naturally talented player in the history of the sport, with some labelling him a 'genius'. Several of his peers regard him as the greatest player ever, although a temperamental streak sometimes leads to a lack of confidence or interest, and he has performed inconsistently throughout his controversial career thus far, with observers noting the 'two Ronnies' aspect of his character. According to Stephen Hendry after his defeat at the 2008 World Championship, \\\"O'Sullivan is the best player in the world by a country mile\\\". O'Sullivan has compiled 764 competitive century breaks during his career, second only to Hendry.</p>\\n<p>O'Sullivan is one of the most popular players on the circuit, noted for being a 'showman', and has helped improve the image of snooker to the general public. O'Sullivan himself has stated his desire for entertaining the watching public, and has said that slow, gritty games put viewers off. He has often been compared to Alex Higgins and Jimmy White, because of both his natural talent and popularity. O'Sullivan has two verified social network accounts, on Twitter and Sina Weibo, with over 253,000 and over 160,000 followers respectively. He updates his Weibo account with the help of two assistants understanding Chinese.</p>\\n<p>In March 2014, Eurosport announced that it had signed an exclusive deal with O'Sullivan to make him its global ambassador for snooker, with the goal of driving the sport's international appeal. As part of the deal, O'Sullivan creates an exclusive snooker series for the network called <i>The Ronnie O'Sullivan Show</i>, which includes his insights into the game, interviews with other professional players, and playing tips. He also wrote for Eurosport-Yahoo! websites and mobile apps during the World Championship.</p>\\n<h2>Personal life</h2>\\n<p>O'Sullivan was born in Wordsley, West Midlands. He grew up, and still lives, in the Manor Road area in Chigwell, Essex, an affluent suburb of London. He attended Wanstead High School. His parents ran sex shops in Soho, and his mother is from Sicily, and his paternal grandfather hails from Cork, Ireland. His father, Ronnie senior, was jailed in 1992 for murder and released 18 years later. O'Sullivan met former girlfriend Jo Langley at Narcotics Anonymous, and he has two children with her. He has another daughter from a previous relationship. He was reported to have split with Langley in early June 2008. In February 2013, he became engaged to actress and former <i>Strictly Come Dancing</i> contestant Laila Rouass, with whom he had been in a relationship since early 2012.</p>\\n<p>He has been labelled a perfectionist, and highly self-critical, even in victory. He suffered from clinical depression, and has had drug-related problems, but works with the sports psychologist Steve Peters, who has helped him overcome his mood swings. Noted for repeatedly declaring his intention to leave the sport, O'Sullivan worked during the 2012/2013 season on a pig farm.</p>\\n<p>In 2003, media sources carried reports that O'Sullivan had converted to Islam, but despite his self-professed interest in the faith, these reports were proven to be false. O'Sullivan also espouses an interest in Buddhism, having spent many lunchtimes at the London Buddhist Centre in Bethnal Green. However, he denies having a firm commitment to any religion.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Stephen_Maguire,_Ronnie_O\\u2019Sullivan,_and_Michaela_Tabb_at_German_Masters_Snooker_Final_(DerHexer)_2012-02-05_05_cropped.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q190782\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":11922118,\"title\":\"Carl Thompson (boxer)\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Carl Adrian Thompson</b> (born 26 May 1964 in Manchester, England) is a retired British boxer and the former WBO, European, &amp; British cruiserweight champion</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Professional boxing career</h2>\\n<h3>Early years</h3>\\n<p>Nicknamed \\\"The Cat\\\", Thompson turned professional boxer in 1988.

He won the 1983 and 1984 West Michigan Division Junior Title (156\\u00a0lb), 1987 Novice Golden Gloves in Manchester (156\\u00a0lb), 1987 Michigan Silver Gloves (156\\u00a0lb) and 1988 Ohio State Fair (156\\u00a0lb)</p>\\n<p>Toney had his first professional fight on October 26, 1988, beating Stephen Lee by a technical knockout in the second round. He was scouted and trained by Gregory Owens as a teenager, who also was his trainer through the mid-nineties. His moniker of \\\"Lights Out\\\" was also given by either Gregory or his son.</p>\\n<p>On March 10, 1989, his manager Johnny \\\"Ace\\\" Smith was killed outside of the Page One Bar in Detroit. Jackie Kallen then became his manager. He won the Michigan Middleweight title in 1990, knocking out Philip Morefield in the 1st round.</p>\\n<p>A draw with Sanderline Williams was the first blemish on Toney's record, although he beat Williams by unanimous decision three months later and in early 1991 he beat Merqui Sosa in a minor upset, between the two top-10-rated contenders.</p>\\n<h3>Middleweight champion</h3>\\n<p>Toney's unbeaten run landed him a shot at Lineal &amp; IBF Middleweight Champion Michael \\\"Second to\\\" Nunn, in May 1991. Nunn dominated the relatively inexperienced Toney over the first 10 rounds with his excellent boxing skills. In an unusually aggressive performance, there were many heated exchanges, but in the 11th round, with time running out for the young Toney, he dropped Michael Nunn to the canvas. The fight was stopped and Toney was the new IBF Middleweight champion.</p>\\n<p>Toney continued a regular fight program over the next 18 months at middleweight, before outgrowing the division, where he made several successful yet disputed defenses. One of the most noteworthy was Toney's split decision win over Dave Tiberi in a fight that many experts feel Toney lost. The decision was so controversial that it prompted United States Senator William Roth of Delaware to call for an investigation into possible corruption in the sport. Toney also outpointed Glenn Wolfe and tough Reggie Johnson and a draw and a win against Mike \\\"The Body Snatcher\\\" McCallum, in two evenly and heated contests.</p>\\n<h3>Super Middleweight champion</h3>\\n<p>Toney moved up to the 168\\u00a0lbs Super Middleweight division, a weight Toney felt would be to his advantage, after struggling to make the Middleweight limit of 160\\u00a0lbs.</p>\\n<p>On February 13, 1993, he challenged Iran Barkley for his IBF Super Middleweight title. After a dominating performance by Toney, the bout was stopped after 9 rounds by Barkley's trainer, Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, due to Barkley suffering severe swelling around both eyes. With Toney now a title holder at 168\\u00a0lbs, alongside Nigel Benn, Chris Eubank and his old nemesis Michael Nunn, the division was now one of the strongest in boxing.</p>\\n<p>Toney remained one of the most active boxers in the sport, winning five mark-time fights throughout 1993, then defeating Tony \\\"The Punching Postman\\\" Thornton in his 1st title defense in October, via a landslide points victory. In his second defense, Toney beat the 24\\u20130 Tim Littles by a 4th round KO. During this bout, Toney suffered a bad cut which caused the referee and ringside doctor to intervene before round 4, allowing him one more round to try to end the fight. His next defense was against former IBF Light Heavyweight champion Prince Charles Williams, whom he knocked out in the 12th and final round. This win paved the way for his fight with Roy Jones, Jr..</p>\\n<p>The fight was Jones' first at Super Middleweight; Jones vacated his Middleweight belt to challenge Toney on November 18, 1994. The fight was the biggest and most anticipated fight of the year with Jones and Toney ranked highly in the pound-for-pound rankings going into the fight. Toney was fancied to win by many experts due to his superior level of competition he'd faced up to this point.</p>\\n<p>Jones won a landslide decision over Toney, an upset at the time, taking Toney apart and briefly flooring Toney for the first time with a flash knockdown in the 3rd round. (Jones used one of his \\\"cockfighting\\\" feigns to lure Toney in, and as Toney mocked Jones, Toney got caught with a leaping left hook.) After the fight Toney blamed making the weight for his flat performance and the loss of his cherished unbeaten record. It was his last fight at the weight.</p>\\n<p>His next fight after losing his title to Roy Jones saw him lose to Montell Griffin at light heavyweight in February 1995. After then winning a series of fights at light heavyweight, cruiserweight, and even heavyweight, he again faced Montell Griffin in December 1996 and once again lost a close decision. He beat old foe Mike McCallum in February 1997, but then lost to journeyman Drake Thadzi in his next fight.</p>\\n<h3>Cruiserweight champion</h3>\\n<p>After taking some time off from the ring, Toney came back in 1999, seemingly focused on reclaiming his status as an elite fighter. He defeated former title holders and title contenders Adolpho Washington, Steve Little and Saul Montana, as well as Sione Asipeli, Courtney Butler, and Michael Rush. In August 2002, Toney beat Jason Robinson in an IBF Cruiserweight title elimination fight. This set up a fight between Toney and the champion, Vassiliy Jirov. After a postponement, the fight happened on April 26, 2003. Going into the 12th and final round, with the scores fairly even and the fight in the balance, Toney knocked the undefeated Jirov down in the 12th. The Kazakh rose from the canvas to go to the distance, but Toney got the judges verdict and was now a three-weight World Champion.</p>\\n<p>For Toney's performance he was awarded comeback of the year and named fighter of the year. The fight itself was named \\\"Fight Of The Year\\\" by <i>The Ring</i> magazine. Immediately afterward, Toney moved up to heavyweight.</p>\\n<h3>Heavyweight</h3>\\n<p>Even when Toney was a middleweight, he insisted that he would one day be the heavyweight champion of the world. His October 4, 2003, victory over aging former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield was Toney's entry into the heavyweight division. After a shaky first round, Toney picked the Atlanta legend apart with shots to the body and head before stopping him in the 9th round. After the fight Toney declared he was \\\"undestructable\\\", that he \\\"got milk baby\\\" and didn't want any \\\"bad ass questions\\\" from announcer Jim Gray.</p>\\n<p>On April 30, 2005, he defeated John Ruiz by a unanimous decision in a 12-round match for the World Boxing Association (WBA) heavyweight Championship. However, Toney failed his post-fight drug test, testing positive for the anabolic steroid stanozolol. This led to the New York Athletic Commission changing the bout's official outcome to a \\\"no-contest\\\", deducting the win from Toney's career record and banning him from boxing for 90 days. The WBA ordered that Ruiz be reinstated as its champion and that Toney be ineligible for another WBA Heavyweight title shot for two years. Toney defended himself by claiming that the steroids were given to him by a doctor to treat an injured arm that occurred during his victory over Rydell Booker in his previous fight. Toney was also subject to a civil lawsuit by Ruiz claiming that Toney's illegal use of steroids gave him an edge in the fight.</p>\\n<p>In his bout after the Ruiz fight, Toney won a unanimous decision victory over former heavyweight contender Dominic Guinn. Toney next fought against Hasim Rahman on March 18, 2006, for the WBC Heavyweight title. The result was a twelve-round majority draw and Toney weighed a career-high 237\\u00a0lb for his lackluster performance.</p>\\n<p>Toney's next two outings were losses to Samuel Peter. The first fight was held in Los Angeles, California on September 2, 2006. Toney lost by split decision. The return bout was held in Hollywood, Florida, on January 6, 2007, and Toney once again lost to Peter, this time by unanimous decision. Both fights were WBC eliminator bouts for the belt held by Oleg Maskaev.</p>\\n<p>Toney returned to action in May 2007 and won a ten-round split decision over Danny Batchelder. Following the bout, Toney once again tested positive for boldenone and stanozolol and was fined $2500 and banned from boxing for a year, Toney appealed the suspension and it was reduced to 6 months after he appeared before the CSAC and claimed he did not knowingly take any steroids and suggested that he was set up and someone had tampered with his water bottle.</p>\\n<p>On July 16, 2008, Toney's rematch against Hasim Rahman was stopped in the third round. An accidental clash of heads to the outside of Rahman's brow opening a cut above Rahman's left eye to the inside of the brow leading to the stoppage. Rahman told the ring doctor he could not see, the ring doctor then stopped the fight. Initially, the fight was called as a TKO win for Toney, but this was overruled by the California State Athletic Commission and the fight was declared no-contest. Rahman went on to fight Wladimir Klitschko for the IBF, IBO and WBO Heavyweight titles in his next fight.</p>\\n<p>Toney's next bout came on December 13, 2008, against Fres Oquendo. Oquendo was penalized one point in round eight for a rabbit punch, which would prove to be the deciding factor in the fight. Toney won a close, controversial split decision. On September 12, 2009, James fought heavyweight fighter Matthew Greer (12\\u20135\\u20130 11KO) at the Pechanga Resort &amp; Casino. James won via TKO victory in round two.</p>\\n<p>On February 24, 2011, Toney made his return to boxing and won a ten round unanimous decision against Damon Reed. All three judges scored the bout 100\\u201390. For this bout Toney weighed in at a career high of 257\\u00a0lbs.</p>\\n<p>On April 7, 2012 Toney fought Bobby Gunn and won by a fifth round stoppage due to a hand injury sustained by Gunn. More than one year later on April 28, 2013 James Toney returned to take on Lucas Browne in Australia, for the WBF heavyweight title and lost by wide unanimous decision. He will not consider retirement but his future is now unclear.</p>\\n<h3>Return to Cruiserweight</h3>\\n<p>On November 4, 2011, Toney stepped into the ring at 199\\u00a0lbs, the lowest he has been since 2003 against Russian star Denis Lebedev in Russia for the interim WBA World cruiserweight title. Toney was never competitive throughout the bout after encountering problems with his left knee during round two, and the judges all had it 108 \\u2013 120. A week after the fight it was revealed Toney needed surgery to repair his knee.</p>\\n<h3>Prizefighter International Heavyweights 2013</h3>\\n<p>It was announced that Toney will compete in Matchroom Sports Prizefighter Series at Heavyweight, it will be the 3rd Prizefighter in which International Heavyweights will compete. It will also be a 1st in a special UK v US tournament, the event took Place on November 14, 2013, at Bethnal Green's York Hall on its usual channel of Sky Sports HD.</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/James_Toney.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q535572\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":1854059,\"title\":\"Leon McKenzie\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Leon Mark McKenzie</b> (born 17 May 1978 in Croydon, Greater London) is an English professional boxer who competes in the Super middleweight class.

He also appeared for Fulham and Peterborough United on loan whilst with The Eagles before securing a permanent move to Peterborough in 2000. Three years later he joined Norwich City and became a part of the side who won promotion to the Premier League. He has since gone on to play for Coventry City, Charlton Athletic and Northampton Town before dropping into Non-league football with Kettering Town and Corby Town. He retired from competitive football on 1 January 2013.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Football career</h2>\\n<p>McKenzie began his career with his local club Crystal Palace, making his debut during the 1995\\u201396 season. In 1997 he was loaned to Fulham and in 1998 to Peterborough United, where he scored 9 goals in 15 games.</p>\\n<p>In 2000 McKenzie joined Peterborough on a permanent basis for a fee of \\u00a325,000. In three years at London Road he scored 49 goals in 103 games.</p>\\n<p>He joined Norwich from Peterborough in December 2003 for a fee of \\u00a3325,000, and instantly won over the Canaries supporters by scoring twice on his debut to help beat local rivals Ipswich Town at Portman Road and go top of the First Division. His goals made a significant contribution to Norwich's promotion to the Premier League as First Division champions at the end of the 2003\\u201304 season. Within a year, he had turned from a Second Division to a Premiership player. McKenzie took time to find his feet in the Premiership but he established a strike partnership with Dean Ashton which would become one of the most potent in the division during the closing stages of the 2004\\u201305 season. His goals helped Norwich to haul themselves into contention to avoid the drop, although they were relegated on the last day of the season.</p>\\n<p>He came third in the Norwich City Supporters Player of The Season vote for the 2004\\u201305, beaten by Darren Huckerby and Damien Francis. The 2005\\u201306 season for McKenzie was interrupted by injuries and personal difficulties surrounding the break-up of his marriage. At the start of the 2006\\u201307 campaign, he handed in a transfer request to manager Nigel Worthington. Although Worthington rejected McKenzie's request, he subsequently confirmed that McKenzie would be sold if they received an offer that matched the club's valuation of the player.</p>\\n<p>McKenzie was signed by Coventry City on transfer deadline day in August 2006 for an initial \\u00a3600,000 that, depending on appearances and promotion, could rise to \\u00a31m. Ironically, Coventry's first match after signing McKenzie was against Norwich \\u2013 however, McKenzie was unable to play due to a condition of the transfer that prevented him from playing in either of the two fixtures between Coventry and Norwich in the 2006\\u201307 season. He made his debut for Coventry on 12 September 2006 as a substitute against Ipswich Town at Portman Road. He started the 2007\\u201308 season well, scoring against Barnsley on the opening day of the season and against Hull, before a knee injury put him out of action for several weeks. He scored in Coventry's opening game of the 2008\\u201309 season against his old club, Norwich City. This marked McKenzie's 100th professional career goal and he celebrated by revealing a vest with \\\"100\\\" on it. He was subsequently booked for his celebration.</p>\\n<p>On 1 September 2009 it was confirmed that he had signed for Charlton Athletic. He scored his first and only goal for Charlton against Southampton in the Football League Trophy on 11 November 2009. He was one of six players to be released by Charlton Athletic following the end of the 2009\\u201310 league season. On 8 September 2010 it was confirmed he had signed a contract with Northampton Town until the end of 2010\\u201311 season.</p>\\n<p>McKenzie featured in a friendly for Conference club Luton Town against Bedford Town prior to the 2011\\u201312 season. On 15 December 2011 Mckenzie announced his retirement from professional football. He played his final game on 17 December 2011, after which he planned to move on to his music career ambitions. In July 2012, however, McKenzie came out of retirement to sign for Conference North side Corby Town. </p>\\n<p>On 1 January 2013 Mckenzie played his last football game for Conference North side Corby Town and is now officially retired from football.</p>\\n<h2>Personal life</h2>\\n<p>He is the son of former British and European boxing champion Clinton McKenzie and nephew of three time world boxing champion Duke McKenzie and former boxer and current politician Winston McKenzie.

Its original remit was to unite workers and unemployed alike in order to bring to the fore, the lack of affordability of housing in the United Kingdom, social injustice, corporate greed and the influence of companies and lobbyists on government. Thwarted in their original aim to camp outside the London Stock Exchange, a camp was set up nearby next to St Paul's Cathedral. On 18 January 2012 Mr Justice Lindblom granted an injunction against continuation of the protest; but the protesters remained in place pending an appeal. The appeal was refused on 22 February, and just past midnight on 28 February bailiffs supported by City of London police began to remove the tents.</p>\\n<p>The protests began in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York, United States, and with support from tax avoidance protest group UK Uncut and the London based contingent of the Spanish 15M movement. In October protesters established two encampments in central London: one outside St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London and the other in Finsbury Square just to the north of the City. In November a third major site was opened in a disused office complex owned by UBS. Named by protesters as the <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, the site was located in Hackney until occupiers were evicted in late January 2012. A fourth site was established in late December, at the unused premises of Old Street Magistrates Court in east London. The site's owners objected to its long term use by Occupiers, and agreement was reached for the building to be vacated by the end of January 2012.</p>\\n<p>In February 2012, occupiers were evicted from their main camp in <i>St Paul's</i>, and from the <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, leaving <i>Finsbury Square</i> as the last London site to remain occupied. The Finsbury Square camp was itself cleared by authorities in June 2012; several of the occupiers went on to establish a new camp in Shoreditch Park, but only remained there for a few days. While no longer maintaining a major physical occupation, the <i>Occupy London</i> group continue to organise meetings, events and actions.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Chronology</h2>\\n<h3>2011 events</h3>\\n<h4>October</h4>\\n<p>On 10 October 2011 a campaign was launched on Facebook for protests to take place at the London Stock Exchange on 15 October in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York and with multiple other protests planned worldwide for that day.</p>\\n<p>The London Stock Exchange in Paternoster Square was the initial target for the protesters on 15 October. Attempts to occupy the square were thwarted by police. Police sealed off the entrance to the square as it was private property, a High Court injunction had been granted against public access to the square. 2,500-3,000 people gathered nearby outside St Paul's Cathedral, with around 250 camping overnight. During the afternoon of 15 October Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, the subject of extradition proceedings by the prosecution authorities of Sweden, gave an impromptu speech to the protesters on the topic of anonymity after he was challenged by police for wearing a mask as he walked to the protest. On the Sunday morning the canon of St. Paul's, Reverend Giles Fraser, asked the police to leave the cathedral steps, saying he was happy for people to \\\"exercise their right to protest peacefully\\\" outside the cathedral.</p>\\n<p>By 17 October an encampment of around 150 tents together with makeshift tarpaulin shelters was clustered around the west side of St Paul's Cathedral. On the 17th the Occupy London protesters issued a nine-point 'Initial Statement' drafted by \\\"an assembly of over 500 people on the steps of St Paul's [Cathedral]\\\". On 21 October, the Dean of St Paul's announced that the cathedral would be closing until further notice as a result of the Occupy London camp pitched outside, and asked the protesters to leave the vicinity of the building \\\"so that the cathedral can reopen as soon as possible\\\". On the evening of the 21st it was reported that the protesters had decided that they would remain in their encampment outside the cathedral, and that they believed that they could not be lawfully removed from the site without a court order.</p>\\n\\n<p>On 22 October the protesters established a second camp in Finsbury Square, just north of the City of London in the London Borough of Islington.</p>\\n<p>On 23 October rock band The Featherz performed a guerilla gig at the St Paul's Cathedral camp as their debut concert.</p>\\n\\n<p>On 26 October it was reported that the Dean of St Paul's had decided that the cathedral would reopen on 28 October, following the resolution of all health and safety concerns. The move was described as an \\\"embarrassing U-turn\\\" by the British national newspaper <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>\\n<p>On 27 October Dr Giles Fraser resigned as Canon Chancellor of St Paul's over disagreements on the handling of the demonstrators, saying \\\"I resigned because I believe that the chapter has set on a course of action that could mean there will be violence in the name of the church.\\\"</p>\\n<p>On 28 October the movement's first set of demands, 'Democratise The City of London Corporation' was published as a first step in the challenging of unaccountable global power elites. The 28th also saw the resignation of the part-time Chaplain of St Paul's Fraser Dyer.</p>\\n<h4>November</h4>\\n<p>On 1 November The Rt Revd Graeme Knowles the Dean of St Paul's resigned following the backlash against his Chapter's resolution to forcibly evict the Occupy London protesters from outside the cathedral. The <i>City of London Corporation</i> proceeded to take legal action against the camp at St Pauls, without support from the Cathedral. Canary Wharf Group took legal action on the 3rd, against protesters attempting to <b>Occupy Docklands</b>.</p>\\n<p>On 18 November, protesters took over a disused office complex owned by the bank <i>UBS</i>, located in the London borough of Hackney. The site was opened to the public the following day as the <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, and provides free services including a library, seminars and various discussion related events. On 28 November protesters at the Hackney site said they would contest attempts by lawyers to have them evicted.</p>\\n<p>During the 2011 UK public sector strikes on 30 November, strikers attempted to occupy Panton House in Central London but were challenged by police and subsequently kettled outside the building.</p>\\n<h4>December</h4>\\n\\n<p>In early December the Metropolitan Police added the occupiers to their list of terrorist suspects. On 6 December, members of the bands Radiohead and Massive Attack performed for free at the <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, as part of a Christmas party for the London occupy movement. On 7 December members of occupy met with Hector Sants, the CEO of the Financial Services Authority, to discuss banking reform. The London occupy movement have began to offer sightseeing tours of London to tourists and plan to host further musical events after the success of the gig involving RadioHead and Massive Attack.</p>\\n<p>On 15 December, Jesse Jackson addressed the Occupy camp at St Pauls, saying that Jesus Christ, Gandhi and Martin Luther King were all occupiers, and that: \\\"Occupy is a global spirit, which is now sweeping the nation and the world, fighting for justice for all of God's children\\\". </p>\\n<p>By late December consensus among occupiers at the main camp in St Pauls had seemed to coalesce round a view that is would be better to leave voluntarily as long as they can be allowed to keep a small presence, and negotiations were started to see if agreement could be reached with the Cathedral. Also in late December a fourth site was established in East London at an unused court and police complex. Occupiers announced plans to use the new site to host a symbolic \\\"trial of the 1%\\\"</p>\\n<h3>Overnight occupancy</h3>\\n<p>In the week beginning 24 October 2011 a number of British national newspapers reported that footage from a thermal imaging camera shot by a police helicopter revealed that only around 10% of the tents at the Occupy London camp outside St Paul's were occupied all night. The protesters disputed these claims and the City of London Police later confirmed that neither the details of the thermal imaging cameras nor the occupancy estimates had come from them. Two British national newspapers, the <i>Daily Mail</i> and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, subsequently videoed the camp using thermal imaging equipment, which they claimed confirmed that only around 10% of the tents were occupied all night.</p>\\n<p>The claims were disputed by the protesters and other journalists, who noted that most protesters did not go to sleep at the time of the day when the images were taken, and thermal imaging produces inaccurate results when used on insulative material like those of the tents. The protesters recorded and published videos using the same thermal camera to demonstrate this, and lodged a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission regarding the claims. They also mentioned that many of them are 'ordinary people with jobs and families' and therefore cannot be present on site at all times.</p>\\n<p>The techniques used by the newspapers were subsequently criticised as \\\"rubbish science\\\" by a military scientist, according to reports in <i>The Guardian</i>, although the source asked to remain anonymous.</p>\\n<p>On 11 November police arrested 170 EDL members on Armistice Day when intelligence revealed EDL members planned to attack campers at St Paul's Cathedral.</p>\\n<h3>2011 statements</h3>\\n<h4>Initial statement</h4>\\n<p>On 16 October, a gathering of over 500 Occupy London protesters collectively agreed upon and issued the following 'Initial Statement':</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<ol><li>The current system is unsustainable. It is undemocratic and unjust. We need alternatives; this is where we work towards them.</li>\\n<li>We are of all ethnicities, backgrounds, genders, generations, sexualities dis/abilities and faiths. We stand together with occupations all over the world.</li>\\n<li>We refuse to pay for the banks\\u2019 crisis.</li>\\n<li>We do not accept the cuts as either necessary or inevitable. We demand an end to global tax injustice and our democracy representing corporations instead of the people.</li>\\n<li>We want regulators to be genuinely independent of the industries they regulate.</li>\\n<li>We support the strike on 30 November and the student action on 9 November, and actions to defend our health services, welfare, education and employment, and to stop wars and arms dealing.</li>\\n<li>We want structural change towards authentic global equality. The world\\u2019s resources must go towards caring for people and the planet, not the military, corporate profits or the rich.</li>\\n<li>The present economic system pollutes land, sea and air, is causing massive loss of natural species and environments, and is accelerating humanity towards irreversible climate change. We call for a positive, sustainable economic system that benefits present and future generations.</li>\\n<li>We stand in solidarity with the global oppressed and we call for an end to the actions of our government and others in causing this oppression.\\n\\n</li>\\n</ol></blockquote>\\n<h4>Statement on The City of London Corporation</h4>\\n<p>On Monday 7 November the first set of demands to come out of Occupy London were ratified by the General Assembly at St Paul's Cathedral. Born out of an earlier statement which was praised in the media as an example of how the protestors were sharpening up their act, they aimed to open the City of London Corporation - the local authority for the UK's financial centre - to deeper scrutiny. Those present said that 200 people voted for the document asking the corporation to open itself to freedom of information requests, publish its accounts retrospectively to 2008, and reveal its financial involvements. The statement from the demonstrators also requested the end of business and corporate votes in elections, the removal of \\\"secrecy practices\\\" and the transparent reform of City institutions along with a commission to examine allegations of corruption. Both statements were met with responses from thinkers such as George Monbiot, Nicholas Shaxson and Blue Labour thinker and peer Lord Glasman.</p>\\n<h4>First statement on corporations</h4>\\n<p>On 29 November the Occupy London movement released first statement of demands on corporations, where they called for measures to end tax evasion by wealthy firms.</p>\\n<h3>2012 events</h3>\\n\\n<p>In January 2012, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced his intention to tackle excessive executive pay and crony capitalism, which <i>Financial Times</i> columnist Philip Stephens suggested may be an indication that the PM has signed up to Occupy values.</p>\\n<p>On 18 January, the High court ruled in favour of the <i>City of London Corporation</i>, giving them the power to order the forcible eviction of occupiers from the St Pauls Camp. A spokesperson for the City said they would not further pursue eviction until 20 January, to give occupiers a chance to appeal against the ruling. The appeal date was later set to 13 February 2012. Comparing the St Pauls camp as it was in January 2012 with its first few weeks, journalists such as Sid Ryan, Brendan O'Neill and Laurie Penny noted a change of character, with energy being diverted from political activism into caring for homeless and mentally ill people attracted by the companionship and shelter. Ryan has argued that despite caring for the homeless being a worthwhile cause, it may help the movement achieve change in the wider world if the camp is evicted.</p>\\n<p>On 30 January, occupiers were evicted from the site where they had set up their <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, by bailiffs acting on behalf of UBS, who own the premises.</p>\\n<p>In mid February, Occupy London took over an abandoned school in Islington, which they called the <i>School of Ideas</i>. They were evicted two weeks later, with authorities arranging for the school to be bulldozed on 28 February. Also on 28 February, occupiers and their tents were removed from the area surrounding St. Paul's Cathedral, by a team of bailiffs supported by riot police. The St Pauls site had been the last surviving high profile camp of the worldwide Occupy movement. At the time of its eviction it was also the largest one remaining. According to the <i>Financial Times</i>, Occupy activists insisted that their campaigning would continue, with some displaying banners announcing that the protests so far were \\\"just the beginning.\\\" Comedian Mark Steel compared the efficiency of the police in the clearing of a few tents with their stumbling investigation of News International. \\\"Last year, presumably , if they'd been asked to evict them, they'd have written a report saying: \\\"We have left no stone unturned in pursuing the occupiers, but after driving round the cathedral hundreds of times we have no evidence of any tents anywhere, or indeed of any cathedral.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In April, Bloomberg reported that the St Paul's camp cost London authorities just over a million pounds in monitoring and legal fees, while the Finsbury Square camp had so far cost about \\u00a310,000.</p>\\n<p>Islington Council won a court order to Finsbury Square on 1 June, giving them the authority to perform a forcible eviction. Occupiers tried to establish an alternative camp in Hampstead Heath, but were immediately moved on by the police. Meanwhile other smaller camps emerged in other parts of London, including Leyton Marshes, Wapping and Limehouse. The Finsbury Square camp was evicted in the early hours of 14 June. Some of the occupiers migrated to nearby Shoreditch Park, where they set up their tents. Occupiers have reported mixed views as to whether the new camp was still a political protest. The Evening Standard was told the Shoreditch camp was a temporary base from which to regroup, and that future \\\"high profile\\\" occupations were planned. However other <i>Occupy London</i> supporters suggested that the new camp was no longer a political protest; several of the evicted campers were homeless with nowhere else to go. One activist said it's uncertain whether there will be future physical occupations. By 26 June the <i>Shoreditch Park</i> camp had gone - locals were unsure where to, or even if the campers had chosen to stay together or to disperse.</p>\\n<p>In October, as part of their celebrations to mark their one year anniversary, <i>Occupy London</i> released <i>The Little book of Ideas</i>, a free ebook which aims to explain financial concepts useful in understanding both the 2008 global crisis and ongoing economic inequality. Another event to mark the anniversary involved protestors entering St Paul's Cathedral during a service, to chain themselves to the pulpit. Also in October, they organised a conference at <i>Friends House</i> London, with special guests including Mick McAteer, TUC senior economist Duncan Weldon and Bank of England director Andy Haldane. Haldane told occupiers that they had been correct about inequality being a cause of the financial crisis. He went on to say that Occupy had helped win the debate concerning the need for reform of the financial sector; that they may play a key role in the ongoing reform process; and that: \\\"policy makers, like me, will need your continuing support in delivering that radical change.\\\" According to the <i>Financial Times</i>, this was the first time a senior Central Banker has asserted that Occupy was correct in their analysis of the crisis.</p>\\n<h3>2014 Events</h3>\\n<p>In October of 2014, 50 to 100 protesters occupied Parliament Square for several days. Their goal was \\u201cdirect the energy from current single-issue struggles into a critical mass that can radically challenge the corrupt and unrepresentative system.\\u201d  The camp was established on the 17th of October and the aim was to stay until Sunday the 26th.  However, on the 19th the police unsuccessfully tried to evict the camp. On the 20th around 140 police were part of an operation to remove the tarpaulin the protesters were sitting on. This lead to the Hash-tag tarpaulin revolution. On the 21st police successfully removed the protesters making initially 15 arrests, including Jenny Jones (Green politician) a Green Party Peer.15 more were arrested later as they tried to retake Parliament square. One protester remained in the square based on the Winston Churchill Statue.  He remained there for over 28 hours until being arrested on a number of charges mainly criminal damage.A large number of protesters stayed behind police fencing to continue the vigil.</p>\\n<p>On Thursday the 23rd the organisers staged a show of force. They asked for people to turn up at the green next to the square, where the protest is now based. An extra 300 people arrived to show support. There was a number of speakers present from Ken Loach to the Artist Taxi driver, Mark McGowan (performance artist). After the speeches protesters linked arms and encircled the square during which there was three breaches of the perimeter fence. the protester who had stayed on the Churchill Statue, known only as Dan, was once again arrested on charges of criminal damage, after throwing sausages to police dogs. the total arrests by Thursday was 40, most of which on charges of breaking bylaws. </p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe police have a duty to facilitate peaceful protest in this country which people have a legal right to do, but that appears to end as soon as you come within shouting distance of the Westminster village. The people who run this country should not be able to tuck demonstrators away out of sight. Parliament needs to listen and people should have the right to get their voices heard.\\u201d Jenny Jones</p>\\n<h2>Reaction to Police over-reaction</h2>\\n<p>In early November 2011, Ed Miliband (the UK Leader of the Opposition) said that mainstream politicians should listen to the occupiers, though he also stated that protesters should not be allowed to control the discussion. One worker in a banking software company, David Pinder, responded to the statement: \\\"I think the message is a bit lost because there's no real solutions being offered. It is one thing to say the system doesn't work but I don't hear any alternatives being proposed.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Responding to Jenny's arrest, Green Party leader Natalie Bennett immediately tweeted: \\\"...There are reports that protesters had umbrellas, cash and other items of no conceivable aggressive use confiscated, and that police in large numbers have tried to make their continued presence as physically uncomfortable as possible.</p>\\n<p>\\\"Prime Minister David Cameron was recently rightly speaking up for the rights of free assembly of the people of Hong Kong. He might like to look out his office window and ensure that the same rights are being respected in London.\\\"</p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<p><b>Related portals:</b></p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Occupy London, activist group homepage</li>\\n<li><i>Bank of Ideas</i> homepage</li>\\n<li>Occupy London gallery in <i>The Guardian</i></li>\\n<li>BBC News - St Paul's camp: Occupy London is 'tourist attraction'</li>\\n</ul>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Occupy_London_Tent.jpg\",\"people\":[{\"pageid\":34149367,\"title\":\"Dada Pranakrsnananda\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Dada Pranakrsnananda</b> is a yogic monk of Ananda Marga since 1971 and a social activist in New York City, where he also teaches Astaunga yoga meditation.

She writes and performs music with a strong folk and roots feel, her songs dealing with a variety of issues from alcoholism to genocide. She has been most recognised for her solo career, winning three awards at the BBC Folk Awards in 2005, and was previously a member of Malinky and Battlefield Band.</p>\\n<p>Polwart is currently a member of The Burns Unit, and collaborated with The Fruit Tree Foundation on its debut album, <i>First Edition</i>.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Biography</h2>\\n<h3>Early life and career</h3>\\n<p>Polwart grew up in the small Stirlingshire town of Banknock and had an interest in music from an early age. She has described her whole family as being interested in music and one of her brothers, Steven, is also a professional musician who plays guitar in the Karine Polwart band, whilst her sister Kerry is developing her own musical career with the group The Poems.</p>\\n<p>Despite an active musical career from a young age, including forming her own band KP and the Minichips at age 10, Polwart was discouraged from studying music at school and ended up studying politics and philosophy at the University of Dundee. After graduating with a First Class Degree in Philosophy Polwart moved to Glasgow to study for a Masters in Philosophical Inquiry.</p>\\n<p>Her first job after her studies was as a philosophy tutor in a primary school, a job she describes as giving her a \\\"massive buzz.\\\" After this she spent six years working for the Scottish Women's Aid movement on issues such as domestic and child abuse and young people's rights and these experiences have influenced her songwriting.</p>\\n<h3>Music career: 2000 to 2005</h3>\\n<p>Polwart initially gained prominence as lead singer of the group Malinky. With the release of their debut album <i>Last Leaves</i> in January 2000, Polwart left her job to concentrate on her musical career. After successful periods with Malinky, macAlias and Battlefield Band, and contributions to three volumes (Volumes 7, 8 and 9) of Linn Records' <i>The Complete Songs of Robert Burns</i> project, she decided to embark on a solo career. In 2003 she released her first solo album, <i>Faultlines</i>. Written and recorded with assistance from the Scottish Arts Council, <i>Faultlines</i> won the Best Album award at the 2005 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. This award, along with 2 others at the same ceremony, increased Polwart's profile not just in the folk community but also in the wider musical arena.</p>\\n<p>The songs on <i>Faultlines</i> cover a variety of topics, and although she has claimed at live performances that they are all quite depressing, many have an uplifting aspect. This is particularly evident in \\\"The Sun's Comin' Over The Hill\\\" (which won Best Original Song at the BBC Folk Awards 2005) which tells the story of woman who reacts to the death of her partner through a period of depression, drink and drugs, but has a more optimistic chorus, with the narrator foreseeing an end to this period. There are exceptions to this: \\\"Waterlily\\\" \\u2014 the tale of a man whose lover is killed during the war in Yugoslavia, based on the book <i>Cold Night Lullaby</i> by Colin Mackay \\u2014 offers no such comfort. \\\"Only One Way\\\", on the other hand, is an upbeat song with a strong political theme and some biting humour.</p>\\n<h3>From 2006 to 2010</h3>\\n<p>In April 2006, Polwart released her second solo album <i>Scribbled in Chalk</i>. This album was heralded with much critical acclaim receiving impressive reviews from amongst others, <i>The Scotsman</i>, <i>The Sunday Times</i>, and <i>The Independent on Sunday</i>. A UK wide tour followed as well as appearances on BBC 2's Culture Show, Simon Mayo's Album show on Radio 2, Mike Harding's folk show on Radio 2, BBC Radio Scotland on the Janice Forsyth show and the Janice Long Late show on Radio 2.</p>\\n<p>Like <i>Faultlines</i>, <i>Scribbled in Chalk</i> often looks at the darker side of life with tales of sex trafficking (\\\"Maybe there's a Road\\\"), the holocaust (\\\"Baleerie Baloo\\\", which is about the missionary Jane Haining) and the uncertainties of life (\\\"Hole in the Heart\\\"). But these stories of despair are balanced by others that describe the joy of a slower life (\\\"Take Its Own Time\\\"), of hope triumphing over cynicism (\\\"Where the Smoke Blows\\\") and the wonder of the universe (\\\"Terminal Star\\\").</p>\\n<p>According to her official website, she believes that songs should stand up by themselves. However, for the sake of those interested in the backstory behind the songs, the website provides information about each of them on the basis that even if a song does work by itself, sometimes the story behind it can make it more meaningful. She has also made guitar tablature available for several of her songs through her website, including notes on tuning and style.</p>\\n<p>As well as her solo work, Polwart spent much of 2006 collaborating with other artists on a variety of projects; Roddy Woomble, the lead singer of Idlewild, asked her to help co-write and provide backing vocals for his solo album, <i>My Secret is My Silence</i>, whilst Polwart provided several original songs for the BBC Radio 2 music/social documentary series <i>The Radio Ballads</i>. Two of these songs, \\\"Can't Weld A Body\\\" and \\\"Firethief\\\", would later appear on her albums <i>Fairest Floo'er</i> and <i>This Earthly Spell</i> respectively. Polwart also supported The Beautiful South on their tour and she guested with David Knopfler at The Globe Theatre for a charity benefit for Reprieve.</p>\\n<p>At the 2006, Hogmanay Live celebrations on BBC Scotland, Polwart played several of her songs and also dueted with Paolo Nutini. Toward the end of the year, she became one of the founder members of a genre-crossing musical collective called The Burns Unit, which has since performed at festivals. The other members are Sushil K Dade, Emma Pollock, Chris Difford, Kenny Anderson, singer Kim Edgar, pianist Michael Johnston and rap artist MC Soom T. The collective issued its debut album, <i>Side Show</i>, in August 2010.</p>\\n<p>In 2007, Polwart playing once again at Celtic Connections both with her band and collaborating with other artists including Dick Gaughan and Roddy Woomble. She took time off from live performance during 2007 as she was pregnant with her first child. During this time she recorded two albums: <i>Fairest Floo'er</i> comprising mostly traditional songs, and <i>This Earthly Spell</i>, containing only original compositions. Polwart also sings with Corrina Hewat and Annie Grace in, what they describe as, a \\\"girly trio.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In March 2009, Polwart took part in the Darwin Song Project, a multi-artist songwriting retreat organised by the Shrewsbury Folk Festival to create songs that had a 'resonance and relevance' to Darwin. A CD was released in August 2009.</p>\\n<p>Polwart's website announced in February 2010 that she intends to take a year's \\\"maternity leave\\\" (Polwart's daughter, Rosa, was born on 1 April 2010) but will perform with the Burns Unit in the summer. She also recorded an EP with Lau which was released through her website in July 2010.</p>\\n<h3>Since 2012</h3>\\n<p>Polwart released her fifth studio album, <i>Traces</i>, in August 2012, to a strongly positive critical response. It became her first official UK Top 75 entry, entering the albums chart at number 57. The album included a new recording of \\\"We're All Leaving\\\" (previously recorded as part of the Darwin Song Project) and nine new songs, including tracks inspired by the Occupy London protests (\\\"King of Birds\\\") and Donald Trump's contested golf course development in Aberdeenshire (\\\"Cover Your Eyes\\\").</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Karine_Polwart_at_Tribute_to_Alistair_Hulett_cropped.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q1729615\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":3703446,\"title\":\"Jimmy Wales\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Jimmy Donal</b> \\\"<b>Jimbo</b>\\\" <b>Wales</b> (/\\u02c8d\\u0292\\u026ami \\u02c8do\\u028an\\u0259l \\u02c8we\\u026alz/; born August 7, 1966) is an American Internet entrepreneur best known as the co-founder and promoter of the online non-profit encyclopedia Wikipedia and the for-profit Wikia web-hosting company. Wales was born in Huntsville, Alabama, where he attended Randolph School, a university-preparatory school. Later he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in finance from Auburn University.</p>\\n<p>While in post-graduate school, he taught at two universities, but left before completing a PhD to take a job in finance and later worked as the research director of a Chicago futures and options firm. In 1996, he and two partners founded Bomis, a male-oriented web portal featuring entertainment and adult content. The company would provide the initial funding for the peer-reviewed free encyclopedia Nupedia (2000\\u201303) and its successor, Wikipedia.</p>\\n<p>On January 15, 2001, with Larry Sanger and others, Wales launched Wikipedia\\u2014a free, open content encyclopedia that enjoyed rapid growth and popularity; as Wikipedia's public profile grew, he became the project's promoter and spokesman.

In 2004 he co-founded Wikia, a for-profit wiki-hosting service. His role in creating Wikipedia, which has become the world's largest encyclopedia, prompted <i>Time</i> magazine to name him in its 2006 list of \\\"The 100 Most Influential People in the World\\\".</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Early life and education</h2>\\n<p>Wales was born in Huntsville, Alabama, on August 7, 1966. His father, Jimmy, worked as a grocery store manager, while his mother, Doris Ann (n\\u00e9e Dudley), and his grandmother, Erma, ran the House of Learning, a small private school in the tradition of the one-room schoolhouse, where Wales and his three siblings received their early education. As a child, Wales was a keen reader with an acute intellectual curiosity.</p>\\n<p>During an interview in 2005 with Brian Lamb, Wales described his childhood private school as a \\\"Montessori influenced philosophy of education,\\\" where he \\\"spent lots of hours poring over the <i>Britannicas</i> and <i>World Book Encyclopedias</i>\\\". There were only four other children in Wales' grade, so the school grouped together the first through fourth-grade students and the fifth through eighth-grade students. As an adult, Wales was sharply critical of the government's treatment of the school, citing the \\\"constant interference and bureaucracy and very sort of snobby inspectors from the state\\\" as a formative influence on his political philosophy.</p>\\n<p>After eighth grade, Wales attended Randolph School, a university-preparatory school in Huntsville, graduating at sixteen. Wales said that the school was expensive for his family, but that \\\"education was always a passion in my household\\u00a0... you know, the very traditional approach to knowledge and learning and establishing that as a base for a good life.\\\" He received his bachelor's degree in finance from Auburn University in 1986. Wales then entered the PhD finance program at the University of Alabama before leaving with a master's degree to enter the PhD finance program at Indiana University. He taught at both universities during his postgraduate studies but did not write the doctoral dissertation required for a PhD, something he ascribed to boredom.</p>\\n<h2>Career</h2>\\n\\n<h3>Chicago Options Associates and Bomis</h3>\\n<p>In 1994, Wales took a job with Chicago Options Associates, a futures and options trading firm in Chicago, Illinois. Wales has described himself as having been addicted to the Internet from an early stage and he wrote computer code during his leisure time. During his studies in Alabama, he had become an obsessive player of Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs)\\u2014a type of virtual role-playing game\\u2014and thereby experienced the potential of computer networks to foster large-scale collaborative projects.</p>\\n<p>Inspired by the remarkably successful initial public offering of Netscape in 1995, and having accumulated capital through \\\"speculating on interest-rate and foreign-currency fluctuations\\\", Wales decided to leave the realm of financial trading and became an Internet entrepreneur. In 1996, he and two partners founded Bomis, a web portal featuring user-generated webrings and, for a time, erotic photographs. Wales described it as a \\\"guy-oriented search engine\\\" with a market similar to that of <i>Maxim</i> magazine; the Bomis venture did not ultimately turn out to be successful.</p>\\n<h3>Nupedia and the origins of Wikipedia</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>Though Bomis had struggled to make money, it provided Wales with the funding to pursue his greater passion, an online encyclopedia. While moderating an online discussion group devoted to the philosophy of Objectivism in the early 1990s, Wales had encountered Larry Sanger, a skeptic of the philosophy. The two had engaged in detailed debate on the subject on Wales' list and then on Sanger's, eventually meeting offline to continue the debate and becoming friends. Years later, after deciding to pursue his encyclopedia project and seeking a credentialed academic to lead it, Wales hired Sanger\\u2014who at that time was a doctoral student in philosophy at Ohio State University\\u2014to be its editor-in-chief, and in March 2000, Nupedia (\\\"the free encyclopedia\\\"), a peer-reviewed, open-content encyclopedia, was launched. The intent behind Nupedia was to have expert-written entries on a variety of topics, and to sell advertising alongside the entries in order to make profit. The project was characterized by an extensive peer-review process designed to make its articles of a quality comparable to that of professional encyclopedias.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<p>The idea was to have thousands of volunteers writing articles for an online encyclopedia in all languages. Initially we found ourselves organizing the work in a very top-down, structured, academic, old-fashioned way. It was no fun for the volunteer writers because we had a lot of academic peer review committees who would criticize articles and give feedback. It was like handing in an essay at grad school, and basically intimidating to participate in.</p>\\n\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In an October 2009 speech, Wales recollects attempting to write a Nupedia article on Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert C. Merton, but being too intimidated to submit his first draft to the prestigious finance professors who were to peer review it, even though he had published a paper on Option Pricing Theory and was comfortable with the subject matter. Wales characterized this as the moment he realized that the Nupedia model was not going to work.</p>\\n<p>In January 2001, Sanger was introduced to the concept of a wiki by extreme programming enthusiast Ben Kovitz after explaining to Kovitz the slow pace of growth Nupedia endured as a result of its onerous submission process. Kovitz suggested that adopting the wiki model would allow editors to contribute simultaneously and incrementally throughout the project, thus breaking Nupedia's bottleneck. Sanger was excited about the idea, and after he proposed it to Wales, they created the first Nupedia wiki on January 10, 2001. The wiki was initially intended as a collaborative project for the public to write articles that would then be reviewed for publication by Nupedia's expert volunteers. The majority of Nupedia's experts, however, wanted nothing to do with this project, fearing that mixing amateur content with professionally researched and edited material would compromise the integrity of Nupedia's information and damage the credibility of the encyclopedia. Thus, the wiki project, dubbed \\\"Wikipedia\\\" by Sanger, went live at a separate domain five days after its creation.</p>\\n<h3>Wikipedia</h3>\\n\\n<p>Originally, Bomis planned to make Wikipedia a profitable business. Sanger initially saw Wikipedia primarily as a tool to aid Nupedia development. Wales feared that at worst, it might produce \\\"complete rubbish\\\". To the surprise of Sanger and Wales, within a few days of launching the number of articles on Wikipedia had outgrown that of Nupedia, and a small collective of editors had formed. It was Jimmy Wales, along with other people, who came up with the broader idea of an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia that would accept contributions from ordinary people. Initially, neither Sanger nor Wales knew what to expect from the Wikipedia initiative. Many of the early contributors to the site were familiar with the model of the free culture movement, and, like Wales, many of them sympathized with the open-source movement. Wales has said that he was initially so worried about the concept of open editing, where anyone can edit the encyclopedia, that he would awake during the night and monitor what was being added. Nonetheless, the cadre of early editors helped create a robust, self-regulating community that has proven conducive to the growth of the project.</p>\\n<p>Sanger developed Wikipedia in its early phase and guided the project. The broader idea he originally ascribes to other people, remarking in a 2005 memoir for <i>Slashdot</i> that \\\"the idea of an open source, collaborative encyclopedia, open to contribution by ordinary people, was entirely Jimmy's, not mine, and the funding was entirely by Bomis. Of course, other people had had the idea\\\", adding, \\\"the actual development of this encyclopedia was the task he gave me to work on.\\\" Sanger worked on and promoted both the Nupedia and Wikipedia projects until Bomis discontinued funding for his position in February 2002; Sanger resigned as editor-in-chief of Nupedia and as \\\"chief organizer\\\" of Wikipedia on March 1 of that year. Early on, Bomis supplied the financial backing for Wikipedia, and entertained the notion of placing advertisements on Wikipedia before costs were reduced with Sanger's departure and plans for a nonprofit foundation were advanced instead.</p>\\n<h4>Controversy</h4>\\n\\n\\n<p>Wales has asserted that he is the sole founder of Wikipedia, and has publicly disputed Sanger's designation as a co-founder. Sanger and Wales were identified as co-founders at least as early as September 2001 by <i>The New York Times</i> and as founders in Wikipedia's first press release in January 2002. In August of that year, Wales identified himself as \\\"co-founder\\\" of Wikipedia. Sanger assembled on his personal webpage an assortment of links that appear to confirm the status of Sanger and Wales as co-founders. For example, Sanger and Wales are historically cited or described in early news citations and press releases as co-founders. Wales was quoted by <i>The Boston Globe</i> as calling Sanger's claim \\\"preposterous\\\" in February 2006, and called \\\"the whole debate silly\\\" in an April 2009 interview.</p>\\n<p>In late 2005, Wales edited his own biographical entry on the English Wikipedia. Writer Rogers Cadenhead drew attention to logs showing that in his edits to the page, Wales had removed references to Sanger as the co-founder of Wikipedia. Sanger commented that \\\"having seen edits like this, it does seem that Jimmy is attempting to rewrite history. But this is a futile process because in our brave new world of transparent activity and maximum communication, the truth will out.\\\" Wales was also observed to have modified references to Bomis in a way that was characterized as downplaying the sexual nature of some of his former company's products. Though Wales argued that his modifications were solely intended to improve the accuracy of the content, he apologized for editing his own biography, a practice generally discouraged on Wikipedia.</p>\\n<h4>Role</h4>\\n<p>In a 2004 interview with <i>Slashdot</i>, Wales outlined his vision for Wikipedia: \\\"Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That\\u2019s what we're doing.\\\" Although his formal designation is board member and chairman emeritus of the Wikimedia Foundation, Wales' social capital within the Wikipedia community has accorded him a status that has been characterized as benevolent dictator, constitutional monarch and spiritual leader. In a 2014 interview, Wales said that while he \\\"has always rejected\\\" the term \\\"benevolent dictator,\\\" he does refer to himself as the \\\"constitutional monarch.\\\" He was also the closest the project had to a spokesperson in its early years. The growth and prominence of Wikipedia made Wales an Internet celebrity. Although he had never traveled outside North America prior to the site's founding, his participation in the Wikipedia project has seen him flying internationally on a near-constant basis as its public face.</p>\\n<p>When Larry Sanger left Wikipedia, Wales' approach was different from Sanger's. He was fairly hands-off. Despite involvement in other projects, Wales has denied intending to reduce his role within Wikipedia, telling <i>The New York Times</i> in 2008 that \\\"Dialing down is not an option for me\\u00a0... Not to be too dramatic about it, but, 'to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language,' that's who I am. That's what I am doing. That's my life goal.\\\" In May 2010, the BBC reported that Wales had relinquished many of his technical privileges on Wikimedia Commons (a Wikipedia sister project that hosts much of its multimedia content) after criticism by the project's volunteer community over what they saw as Wales' hasty and undemocratic approach to deleting sexually explicit images he believed \\\"appeal solely to prurient interests\\\".</p>\\n<h3>Wikimedia Foundation</h3>\\n\\n<p>In mid-2003, Wales set up the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), a non-profit organization founded in St. Petersburg, Florida and later headquartered in San Francisco, California. All intellectual property rights and domain names pertaining to Wikipedia were moved to the new foundation, whose purpose is to establish general policy for the encyclopedia and its sister projects. Wales has been a member of the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees since it was formed and was its official chairman from 2003 through 2006. Since 2006 he has been accorded the honorary title of chairman emeritus and holds the board-appointed \\\"community founder\\\" seat. His work for the foundation, including his appearances to promote it at computer and educational conferences, has always been unpaid. Wales has often joked that donating Wikipedia to the foundation was both the \\\"dumbest and the smartest\\\" thing he had done. On one hand, he estimated that Wikipedia was worth US$3 billion; on the other, he weighed his belief that the donation made its success possible.</p>\\n<p>Wales gives an annual \\\"State of the Wiki\\\" address, at the Wikimania conference.</p>\\n<h4>Controversies</h4>\\n<p>Wales' association with the foundation has led to controversy. In March 2008, Wales was accused by former Wikimedia Foundation employee Danny Wool of misusing the foundation's funds for recreational purposes. Wool also stated that Wales had his Wikimedia credit card taken away in part because of his spending habits, a claim Wales denied. Then-chairperson of the foundation Florence Devouard and former foundation interim Executive Director Brad Patrick denied any wrongdoing by Wales or the foundation, saying that Wales accounted for every expense and that, for items for which he lacked receipts, he paid out of his own pocket; in private, Devouard upbraided Wales for \\\"constantly trying to rewrite the past\\\". Later in March 2008, it was claimed by Jeffrey Vernon Merkey that Wales had edited Merkey's Wikipedia entry to make it more favorable in return for donations to the Wikimedia Foundation, an allegation Wales dismissed as \\\"nonsense\\\".</p>\\n<h3>Wikia and later pursuits</h3>\\n<p>In 2004, Wales and then-fellow member of the WMF Board of Trustees Angela Beesley founded the for-profit company Wikia. Wikia is a wiki farm\\u2014a collection of individual wikis on different subjects, all hosted on the same website. It hosts some of the largest wikis outside Wikipedia, including Memory Alpha (devoted to <i>Star Trek</i>) and Wookieepedia (<i>Star Wars</i>). Another service offered by Wikia was Wikia Search, an open source search engine intended to challenge Google and introduce transparency and public dialogue about how it is created into the search engine's operations, but the project was abandoned in March 2009. Wales stepped down as Wikia CEO to be replaced by angel investor Gil Penchina, a former vice president and general manager at eBay, on June 5, 2006. Penchina declared Wikia to have reached profitability in September 2009. In addition to his role at Wikia, Wales is a public speaker represented by the Harry Walker Agency. He has also participated in a celebrity endorsement campaign for the Swiss watch maker Maurice Lacroix.</p>\\n<p>On November 4, 2011, Wales delivered an hour-long address at The Sage Gateshead in the United Kingdom to launch the 2011 Free Thinking Festival on BBC Radio Three. His speech, which was entitled \\\"The Future of the Internet\\\", was largely devoted to Wikipedia. Twenty days later, on November 24, Wales appeared on the British topical debate television program <i>Question Time</i>.</p>\\n<p>In May 2012, it was reported that Wales was advising the UK government on how to make taxpayer-funded academic research available on the internet at no cost. His role reportedly involved working as \\\"an unpaid advisor on crowdsourcing and opening up policymaking\\\", and advising the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills and the UK research councils on distributing research.</p>\\n<p>In January 2014, it was announced that Wales had joined The People's Operator as co-chair of the mobile phone network.</p>\\n<p>On March 21, 2014, Wales spoke on a panel at a Clinton Global Initiative University conference held at Arizona State University, along with John McCain, Saudi Arabian women's rights activist Manal al-Sharif and Harvard University student Shree Bose. The topic of discussion was \\\"the age of participation\\\" and the ability of an increasingly large number of citizens to \\\"express their own opinions, pursue their own educations, and launch their own enterprises.\\\" Wales exhorted young people to use social media to try to bring about societal change, and compared government suppression of the Internet to a human rights violation.</p>\\n<p>On May 26, 2014, Google appointed Wales to serve on a seven-member committee on privacy in response to <i>Google v. Gonzalez</i>, which led to their being inundated with requests to remove websites from their search results. Wales said he wanted the committee to be viewed as \\\"a blue-ribbon panel\\\" by lawmakers and for the committee to advise them as well as Google.</p>\\n<h2>Political and economic views</h2>\\n\\n\\n<h3>Personal philosophy</h3>\\n<p>Wales is a self-avowed Objectivist, referring to the philosophy invented by writer Ayn Rand in the mid-20th century that emphasizes reason, individualism, and capitalism. Wales first encountered the philosophy through reading Rand's novel <i>The Fountainhead</i> during his undergraduate period and, in 1992, founded an electronic mailing list devoted to \\\"Moderated Discussion of Objectivist Philosophy\\\". Though he has stated that the philosophy \\\"colours everything I do and think\\\", he has said, \\\"I think I do a better job\\u2014than a lot of people who self-identify as Objectivists\\u2014of not pushing my point of view on other people.\\\"</p>\\n<p>When asked by Brian Lamb about Rand's influence on him in his appearance on C-SPAN's <i>Q&amp;A</i> in September 2005, Wales cited integrity and \\\"the virtue of independence\\\" as personally important. When asked if he could trace \\\"the Ayn Rand connection\\\" to a personal political philosophy at the time of the interview, Wales labeled himself a libertarian, qualifying his remark by referring to the U.S. Libertarian Party as \\\"lunatics\\\", and citing \\\"freedom, liberty, basically individual rights, that idea of dealing with other people in a matter that is not initiating force against them\\\" as his guiding principles.</p>\\n<p>An interview with Wales served as the cover feature of the June 2007 issue of the libertarian magazine <i>Reason</i>. In that profile, he described his political views as \\\"center-right\\\".</p>\\n<p>In a 2011 interview with <i>The Independent</i>, he expressed sympathy with the Occupy Wall Street and Occupy London protesters, saying, \\\"You don't have to be a socialist to say it's not right to take money from everybody and give it to a few rich people. That's not free enterprise.\\\"</p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Wikimedia_Conference_2013_-_board_meeting_10.JPG\",\"wikidata\":\"Q181\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":4079898,\"title\":\"Graeme Knowles\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Graeme Paul Knowles</b> CVO (born 25 September 1951) was installed as Dean of St Paul's Cathedral, London on 1 October 2007 after Letters Patent were issued on 20 September 2007.

Mark Field was educated at state-funded grammar school, Reading School and St Edmund Hall, Oxford and graduated with a B.A. degree in Law in 1987. He was Secretary and National Political Officer of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1985-86; JCR President of St Edmund Hall, Oxford in 1986; and News Editor of student newspaper, <i>Cherwell</i> while it was under the editorships of Christina Lamb and Anne McElvoy. During his student days, Field also set up a small publishing business after spotting a gap in the market for careers handbooks in the legal field. He completed his education at The College of Law, Chester, qualifying as a solicitor in 1990.</p>\\n<h2>Career before Parliament</h2>\\n<p>Whilst an undergraduate he became a personal assistant to the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, John (now Lord) Patten, before training as a solicitor, practising as a corporate lawyer for Freshfields between 1990 and 1992. He then became a director of his own employment agency, Kellyfield Consulting from 1994 until 2001. The company employed a dozen staff and turned over almost \\u00a32 million per annum. After being elected to Parliament he sold his share of that business to a consortium led by his former business partner.</p>\\n<p>He became the Vice Chairman of the Islington North Conservative Association for two years from 1989, and was elected as a Councillor in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in 1994 before standing down in 2002 after his election to the House of Commons. He contested the Conservative held seat of Enfield North at the 1997 General Election following the retirement of the sitting MP Tim Eggar. However, 1997 was the year of Labour's Parliamentary landslide and he was defeated at the election by Labour's Joan Ryan by 6,822 votes.</p>\\n<h2>Parliamentary career</h2>\\n<p>In December 1999 he was selected to contest the safe Conservative seat of the Cities of London and Westminster following the retirement of the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Brooke at the 2001 General Election. Field won the seat with a majority of 4,499 and has been returned to Parliament with an increased majority twice since (2005 - 8095; 2010 - 11076).</p>\\n<p>Field made his maiden speech on 27 June 2001, when he announced his great political hero was the former Prime Minister Andrew Bonar Law.</p>\\n<p>In Parliament, Mark Field was a member of the Lord Chancellor's Department and the renamed Constitutional Affairs Select Committee for a year from 2003. He was made an Opposition Whip by Iain Duncan Smith in 2003, becoming the Shadow Minister for London later that year. Between May and December 2005 he was Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury. In the eleven months to November 2006 he was the Conservative Party's spokesman on Culture, Media and Sport under the new leadership of David Cameron in 2005. During his tenure he led for the Opposition on the National Lottery Act 2006 and promoted the policy of safeguarding lottery funds for the four original causes of the arts, heritage, charities and sport. He also led debates and opposition to the lack of leadership and vision in Britain's declining public library service. His other responsibilities included the Arts, Heritage, Architecture and Design, Museums and Galleries, the Royal Parks, Regional Policy and Local Government as well as aspects of broadcasting.</p>\\n<p>In September 2010, Field was appointed by the Prime Minister to the prestigious Intelligence &amp; Security Committee, chaired by former Foreign Secretary, Sir Malcolm Rifkind. He is the youngest MP on this Committee, which reports directly to 10 Downing Street and oversees the UK\\u2019s intelligence and security services.</p>\\n<p>He takes a special interest in economic matters, financial services, foreign trade and international development and is currently Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Venture Capital &amp; Private Equity as well as Vice Chairman of the Groups on Football and Bangladesh. He previously served as Chairman of the APPGs for Azerbaijan and Business Services. He has served on the Standing Committees of several important pieces of legislation, including the Business Rates Supplements Act and the Finance Acts in 2008 and 2009.</p>\\n<p>As a backbencher, Field has tabled a number of debates on issues of local and national importance such as homelessness, Northern Ireland, Government debt, Heathrow airport, policing in London, social housing, home education and population estimates. He has run local campaigns on business rates, St Bartholomew's Hospital, assisting the creative industries, the control of rickshaws in the West End, social housing rent rises, the independence of the City of London Police and in July 2011 successfully argued in Parliament for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport's continuing control of the Royal Parks.</p>\\n<p>Field was also an outspoken critic of the previous system governing MPs' second home allowances. Field was found not to be making excessive claims by the <i>Daily Telegraph'</i>s investigation of MPs\\u2019 expenses.</p>\\n<p>He articulated the thoughts of many following the overwhelming \\\"No to AV\\\" referendum which was held on 5 May 2011, saying: \\\"I\\u2019m pretty sure that David Cameron will be very energised by what\\u2019s happened. Clearly there will be an effort to try to sure up [<i>sic</i>] Nick Clegg\\u2019s position but I think the idea now that there will be a whole lot of policy concessions allowing the Liberals to look good in the months to come is way, way short of the mark.\\\" </p>\\n<p>Field is Patron of the Bishopsgate Institute and St Andrew's Club. He is a Freeman of the City of London and a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors.</p>\\n<p>In October 2011, Field voiced opposition to Occupy London protestors camped in his constituency. He expressed concern that their \\\"tent city\\\" was turning into a \\\"semi-permanent encampment\\\" which was disrupting St Paul's, a \\\"key iconic tourist site\\\" and place of worship. He suggested that police should clear the camp at night and went on record in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, stating: \\\"While no one expects anti-capitalism to be a 24-hour activity, I would have hoped the protesters would show a little more respect for the sanctity of St Paul\\u2019s.\\\" On 28 February 2012, after 137 days of occupation, Field's initial recommendation became reality following a Court order when the site was cleared by the City of London Police in just 137 minutes.</p>\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q304450\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":27120789,\"title\":\"Nicholas Cottam\",\"text\":\"<p>Major-General <b>Nicholas Jeremy Cottam</b> CB\\u00a0OBE (born 1951) was a senior British Army officer who went on to be Military Secretary.

Cottan spoke out against the unruly behaviour of the protesters, who he said had in some instances desecrated the cathedral.

It lies between Liverpool Street and Mile End stations, and in Travelcard Zone 2. The station was opened as part of the long planned Central line eastern extension on 4 December 1946; before that it was used as an air-raid shelter. On 3 March 1943, 173 people were killed in a crush while attempting to enter the shelter.</p>\\n<p>The station is an example of the \\\"New Works Programme 1935 - 1940\\\" style adopted by London Transport for its new tube stations. Extensive use is made of pale yellow tiling, originally manufactured by Poole Pottery. This has been replicated during the 2007 modernisation although several panels of original tiling were retained on the platforms. The finishes include relief tiles, showing symbols of London and the area served by the London Passenger Transport Board, designed by Harold Stabler. The station entrances, all in the form of subway access staircases to the subterranean ticket hall, all show the design influences of Charles Holden, the consulting architect for London Transport at this time.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Wartime disaster</h2>\\n<p>Construction of the Central line's eastern extension was started in the 1930s, and the tunnels were largely complete at the outbreak of the Second World War although rails were not laid. The facilities at Bethnal Green were requisitioned in 1940 at the onset of the first Blitz and administration was assigned to the local authority, the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green, under the supervision of the 'Regional Commissioners', the generic name for London civil defence. Heavy air raids began in October and thousands of people took shelter there, often remaining overnight. However, usage of the shelter dwindled in 1941 as the Luftwaffe was redirected away from London and against the Soviet Union. A relative lull occurred although the number of shelterers rose again when retaliatory bombing in response to Royal Air Force raids was expected.</p>\\n<p>This was the case on 3 March 1943, after British media reported a heavy RAF raid on Berlin on the night of 1 March. The air-raid Civil Defence siren sounded at 8:17 pm, triggering a heavy but orderly flow of people down the blacked-out staircase from the street. A middle-aged woman and a child fell over, three steps up from the base and others fell around her, tangled in an immovable mass which grew, as they struggled, to nearly 300 people. Some managed to get free but 173, most of them women and children, were crushed and asphyxiated. Some 60 others were taken to hospital. News of the disaster was withheld for 36 hours and reporting of what had happened was censored, giving rise to allegations of a cover-up. At the end of the war, the Minister of Home Security, Herbert Morrison quoted from a secret report to the effect that there had been a panic, caused by the discharge of anti-aircraft rockets. But other authorities who looked into what had happened disagreed; the Shoreditch Coroner, Mr W R H Heddy said that there was \\\"nothing to suggest any stampede or panic or anything of the kind\\\"; Mr Justice Singleton, summarising his decision in <i>Baker v Bethnal Green Corporation</i>, an action for damages by a bereaved widow \\\"there was nothing in the way of rushing or surging\\\" on the staircase; the Master of the Rolls, Lord Greene, reviewing the lower court's judgement said \\\"it was perfectly well known .. that there had been no panic\\\". Lord Greene also rebuked the Ministry for getting the case to be held in secret.</p>\\n<p>The Baker lawsuit was followed by other claims, resulting in a total payout of nearly \\u00a360,000, the last of which was made in the early 1950s. The secret official report, by a Metropolitan magistrate, Laurence Rivers Dunne, acknowledged that Bethnal Green Council had warned London Civil Defence, in 1941, that the staircase needed a crush barrier to slow down the crowds, but was told that would be a waste of money.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was not until 50\\u00a0years after the disaster that a discreet commemorative plaque was erected at the site.</p>\\n<p>The crush at Bethnal Green is thought to have been the largest single loss of civilian life in the UK in World War II and the largest loss of life in a single incident on the London Underground network. The largest number killed by a single wartime bomb was 68 at Balham, though there were many more British civilians killed in single bombing raids.</p>\\n<p>The \\\"Stairway to Heaven Memorial Trust\\\" was established in 2007 to create a memorial to those who died in the disaster. Planning permission has been granted for a memorial in the form of a bronze staircase with 173 points of light, designed by local architects Harry Patticas and Jens Borstlemann.</p>\\n<h3>'TUBE' Art Installation</h3>\\n<p>In November 2013 sound artist Kim Zip  created an installation  commemorating the Bethnal Green Tube Disaster.

The company was initially based at Islington Studios which were built as a power station for the Great Northern &amp; City Railway it was later converted to studios. Other films were made at Lime Grove and Pinewood Studios. The former Islington studios were demolished in 2002 and flats built on the site in 2004. A London Borough of Hackney historical plaque is attached to the building. The studio is best remembered for the Gainsborough melodramas it produced in the 1940s. </p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>Gainsborough was founded in 1924 by Michael Balcon and was a sister company to the Gaumont British from 1927, with Balcon as Director of Production for both studios. Whilst Gaumont-British, based at Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush produced the 'quality' pictures, Gainsborough mainly produced 'B' movies and melodramas at its Islington Studios. Both studios used continental film practices, especially those from Germany, with Alfred Hitchcock being encouraged by Balcon\\u2014who had links with UFA\\u2014to study there and make multilingual co-production films with UFA, before the war. In the 1930s, actors Elisabeth Bergner and Conrad Veidt, art director Alfred Junge, cinematographer Mutz Greenbaum and screenwriter/director Berthold Viertel, along with others, joined the two studios.</p>\\n<p>The studio's opening logo was of a lady (Glennis Lorimer) in a Georgian era period costume sitting in an ornate frame, turning and smiling, based on the famous portrait of Sarah Siddons by Gainsborough. The short piece of music was written by Louis Levy and called Gainsborough Minuet.</p>\\n<p>After the departure of Balcon to MGM-British, the Rank Organisation gained an interest in Gainsborough and the studio made such popular films as <i>Oh, Mr Porter!</i> (1937) and Hitchcock's <i>The Lady Vanishes</i> (1938). By 1937, Gaumont-British were in financial crisis, and closed their Lime Grove studios, moving all production to the Islington Poole Street studio. However, the tall factory chimney on the site was considered dangerous in the event of bombing during World War II, and thus Gainsborough Studios were evacuated to Lime Grove for the duration of hostilities.</p>\\n<p>From 1942 to 1946, a series of morally ambivalent costume melodramas was produced by Gainsborough for the domestic market. They were mostly based on recent popular books by female novelists. Prominent titles included the <i>The Man in Grey</i> (1943), <i>Madonna of the Seven Moons</i> (1944), <i>Fanny by Gaslight</i> (1944), <i>The Wicked Lady</i> (1945) and <i>Caravan</i> (1946). The films featured a stable of leading British actors, among them Margaret Lockwood, James Mason, Stewart Granger and Patricia Roc. The studio also made modern-dress comedies and melodramas such as <i>Love Story</i> (1944), <i>Two Thousand Women</i> (1944), <i>Time Flies</i> (starring Tommy Handley, 1944), <i>Bees in Paradise</i> (with Arthur Askey directed by Val Guest, 1944), <i>They Were Sisters</i> (1945), and <i>Easy Money</i> (1948).</p>\\n<p>Subsequent productions, overseen by Betty Box (who at the time was the only major female producer in British cinema), included <i>Miranda</i> (1948) and the Huggett family series with Jack Warner, Kathleen Harrison, and Petula Clark. Unhappy with the performance of the studio, Rank closed it down in early 1949. Production was concentrated at Pinewood Studios. Although at first films continued to be made there under the Gainsborough banner, this quickly stopped and no further Gainsborough films were released after 1951.</p>\\n<h2>Demolition</h2>\\n<p>The Lime Grove site was taken over by the BBC in 1949 and used for TV current affairs and other programmes until it was closed in 1991. The buildings were demolished in the early 90s, and replaced with housing called <i>Gaumont Terrace</i> and <i>Gainsborough Court</i>.</p>\\n<p>The former Islington Studios, in Poole Street, remained largely derelict after their closure in 1951 apart from occasional art performances, including two epic Shakespearean productions by the Almeida Theatre Company, April\\u2013July 2000, directed by Jonathan Kent and starring Ralph Fiennes, and a closing <i>Hitchcock season</i> in October 2003.</p>\\n<p>The buildings began to be cleared in 2002, and apartments named <i>Gainsborough Studios</i> were built on the site in 2004, by architects Munkenbeck and Marshall.</p>\\n<h2>Films</h2>\\n\\n<h2>References and notes</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\\n<ul><li>Cook, Pam (ed), <i>Gainsborough Pictures</i> (1997);</li>\\n<li>Harper, Sue, <i>Picturing the Past: the Rise and Fall of the British Costume Film</i> (1994);</li>\\n<li>Harper, Sue, <i>Women in British Cinema</i> (2000).</li>\\n</ul><h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li><i>Gainsborough Pictures</i> at the British Film Institute's Screenonline</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Gainsborough_Pictures.jpg\",\"people\":[{\"pageid\":26811793,\"title\":\"Ronnie Taylor\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Ronald Josiah \\\"Ronnie\\\" Taylor</b> (born 27 October 1924) is a British cinematographer, who has collaborated with directors Richard Attenborough and Dario Argento.</p>\\n<p>He was born in Hampstead, London and joined the film business at nineteen.

Her family moved from London to Eagles Nest, Cornwall in 1955. She is the younger daughter of painter Patrick Heron and Delia Heron (n\\u00e9e Reiss ) and sister of architect Katharine Heron.

She exhibited a series of related works in 1992 including engravings on slate salvaged from pool tables, and Shima: Island and Garden a book and series of cibachrome photographs. (Arts Council Collection)</p>\\n<p>In 2002 Heron made the 'Elements' drawings a series of ink drawings originally made for a commission in Tokyo in 2001 but which have evolved as a body of work to be recreated and transformed by location, scale and substance. 'The 'Elements' drawings\\u2026 are in a sense metaphors for scale and for time. Like mathematical systems, they are elements, essences, reproducible at any size. They can be used in the building in Tokyo, in a London street, on the walls of a gallery or as tiny prints. Like found objects they are transportable; but the experience of the works is specific, rooted in a particular time and place.'. In 2002 Heron exhibited 'Elements' a site specific installation of large scale wall drawings for the Warwick Arts Centre.</p>\\n<h2>Commissioned works</h2>\\n<p>In 1995 Heron completed her first site specific commission 'Slate Frieze', 23 rectangular slabs of engraved slate over a 21m length wall in the Council of the European Union, Brussels.
