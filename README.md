Data Scope
==========

Data Scope is a mashup framework meant to facilitate the execution of complex search queries. 
Think about search queries like: “which websites name at least three experts from field X?”, 
“which websites support stance X?”, “what are iconical images for X in culture A, B & C?” and 
“which people are known for similar reasons that person X is known for?”. 
Data Scope allows a programmer to reach over walled gardens of information that he/she may need and
combine the information into new information. 
Due to its nature Data Scope is very suitable for software that tries to break out of filter bubbels.


Development
===========

Currently Data Scope is under active development and recently underwent some big changes to be future proof. 
I want to improve on test coverage and documentation. Any frontends are available in the ds-webapps repo. 

Roadmap
=======

A people-suggestions algorithm is in the making that answers: 
“which people are known for similar reasons that person X is known for?”. Another algorithm that is coming up is 
city-celebrities that answers: "which well known people are associated with location X". 
Apart from that the focus will be more towards machine learning to be able to create ever more complex mashups, 
that answer interesting questions.
